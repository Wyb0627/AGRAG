water_pollution	the paper deals with the nonlinear inverse source problem of identifying an unknown time-dependent point source occurring in a two-dimensional evolution advection-dispersion-reaction equation with spatially varying velocity field and dispersion tensor. the originality of this study consists in establishing a constructive identifiability theorem that leads to develop an identification method using only significant boundary observations and operating other than the classic optimization approach. to this end, we derive two dispersion-current functions that have the main property to be of orthogonal gradients which yield identifiability of the elements defining the involved unknown source from some boundary observations related to the associated state. provided the velocity field fulfills the so-called no-slipping condition, the required boundary observations are reduced to only recording the state on the outflow boundary and its flux on the inflow boundary of the monitored domain. we establish an identification method that uses those boundary records (1) to localize the sought source position as the unique solution of a nonlinear system defined by the two dispersion-current functions, (2) to give lower and upper bounds of the total amount loaded by the unknown time-dependent source intensity function, (3) to transform the identification of this latest into solving a deconvolution problem. some numerical experiments on a variant of the surface water bod pollution model are presented.
smart_material	the use of renewable materials is essential in future technologies to harmonize with our living environment. renewable materials can maintain our resources from the environment so as to overcome degradation of natural environmental services and diminished productivity. this paper reviews recent advancement of renewable materials for smart material applications, including wood, cellulose, chitin, lignin, and their sensors, actuators and energy storage applications. to further improve functionality of renewable materials, hybrid composites of inorganic functional materials are introduced by incorporating carbon nanotubes, titanium dioxide and tin oxide conducting polymers and ionic liquids. since renewable materials have many advantages of biocompatible, sustainable, biodegradable, high mechanical strength and versatile modification behaviors, more research efforts need to be focused on the development of renewable smart materials.
solar_energy	main conclusion evidence shows that decreasing the light-harvesting antenna size of the photosystems in tobacco helps to increase the photosynthetic productivity and plant canopy biomass accumulation under high-density cultivation conditions. decreasing, or truncating, the chlorophyll antenna size of the photosystems can theoretically improve photosynthetic solar energy conversion efficiency and productivity in mass cultures of algae or plants by up to threefold. a truncated light-harvesting chlorophyll antenna size (tla), in all classes of photosynthetic organisms, would help to alleviate excess absorption of sunlight and the ensuing wasteful non-photochemical dissipation of excitation energy. thus, solar-to-biomass energy conversion efficiency and photosynthetic productivity in high-density cultures can be increased. applicability of the tla concept was previously shown in green microalgae and cyanobacteria, but it has not yet been demonstrated in crop plants. in this work, the tla concept was applied in high-density tobacco canopies. the work showed a 25% improvement in stem and leaf biomass accumulation for the tla tobacco canopies over that measured with their wild-type counterparts grown under the same ambient conditions. distinct canopy appearance differences are described between the tla and wild type tobacco plants. findings are discussed in terms of concept application to crop plants, leading to significant improvements in agronomy, agricultural productivity, and application of photosynthesis for the generation of commodity products in crop leaves.
suspension_bridge	the development of optics and computer technologies enables the application of the vision-based technique that uses digital cameras to the displacement measurement of large-scale structures. compared with traditional contact measurements, vision-based technique allows for remote measurement, has a non-intrusive characteristic, and does not necessitate mass introduction. in this study, a high-speed camera system is developed to complete the displacement measurement in real time. the system consists of a highspeed camera and a notebook computer. the high-speed camera can capture images at a speed of hundreds of frames per second. to process the captured images in computer, the lucas-kanade template tracking algorithm in the field of computer vision is introduced. additionally, a modified inverse compositional algorithm is proposed to reduce the computing time of the original algorithm and improve the efficiency further. the modified algorithm can rapidly accomplish one displacement extraction within 1 ms without having to install any pre-designed target panel onto the structures in advance. the accuracy and the efficiency of the system in the remote measurement of dynamic displacement are demonstrated in the experiments on motion platform and sound barrier on suspension viaduct. experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can extract accurate displacement signal and accomplish the vibration measurement of large-scale structures.

suspension_bridge	this study was designed to compare the pull-out strength of simple suture stitches in human supraspinatus tendons with respect to the position of the rotator cable. fifty-four tests were performed on 6 intact, human supraspinatus tendons, to assess the cutout strength of a simple suture configuration in different positions; medial to, lateral to, or within the rotator cable. tendon thickness was measured and correlated for each positioned suture. suture positioning lateral to or in the rotator cable showed significantly lower suture retention properties compared with positioning the suture medial to the cable (p = 0.002). in all tested specimens, the central stitch in the row medial to the rotator cable provided the optimum retention properties (mean: 191 n; sd: +/- a 44; p < 0.01), even after correcting for tendon thickness. this study shows that it is desirable to identify the rotator cable and to pass sutures just medial to it, close to the middle of the tendon, which provided highest possible suture retention properties.
solar_energy	green vehicles, such as electric vehicles (evs), are getting noteworthy popularity among consumers worldwide. the purpose of this paper is to establish evs as a feasible long-term solution for the future of technology in the vehicle industry, which can decrease the current dependency on fossil fuels and also decrease greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. as a part of long-term benefits, the adoption of evs gives environmentally friendly innovation to society. despite positive environmental implications, the total number of evs in usage is still inadequate. one of the major causes of this insubstantial adoption of evs is largely dependent on the perceptions of consumers regarding evs. however, this particular research study offers an inclusive outline on the existing hurdles for consumer adoption of evs as well as a framework of the theoretical standpoints that were developed for the adoption behaviour, in addition to considering consumer intentions in the direction of evs. in this particular study, the researcher found that the literature regarding ev adoption tried to address only the diffusion method of evs. whereas this study highlights consumer innovations, which provides a wide insight on consumer emotions to overlook the major aspect in consumer evs' adoption research. the theme of this particular literature can be implemented in order to better understand the consumers' emotions and behaviour towards the adoption of evs. the scholars further stated that there is a possible cause for more recent developments within the technological adoption part that can assist to be a standard for upcoming developments. for the last few years, knowledge regarding the problems surrounding the adoption and diffusion of evs has gained less attention. this study expands this line of research by focusing on making a chance for developing the theoretical frameworks in terms of adding emotions in a psychological perspective where consumer behaviour and ethics are considered. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
solar_energy	this study develops a renewable energy management system (rems) for the control of photovoltaic (pv) smart inverters to mitigate the voltage violation of distribution systems with high penetration of pv installation. the impact analysis of distribution feeders with the pv system integration for decision making of smart inverter control has been embedded in rems to solve the voltage violation problem. to verify the effectiveness of the proposed rems to enhance the system voltage quality, a pv system installed in a distribution feeder of taiwan power company (taipower) has been selected for field testing. the real power, reactive power, and voltage of the studied pv system have been collected. the impact analysis of pv integration is performed to solve the mitigation of voltage variation by the control of reactive power compensation of smart inverters. it is found that the voltage at the test pv system is very consistent with the field test results. the computer simulation of a distribution feeder with a large pv farm has been executed to illustrate that the control of smart inverters can enhance the utilization of solar energy by reducing the curtailment of renewable power generation dramatically for a distribution system with high penetration of pv systems.
construction_management	the ""golden ring of russia"" is considered to be the most famous tourist route in russia since the 1970s. now it acts as a famous umbrella brand and also as a pattern for tourism development in other parts of the country. the golden ring sites still keep up high tourism and recreational attractiveness, but the inbound and domestic tourist flows are declining. in the last decade this route is subjected to significant changes that lead to its functional and spatial transformation. the article discusses various factors which cause these changes. the research methodology is based on a combination of systems approach, geographical and statistical studies and spatial construction management. the research results show that the original circle route is now replaced by a number of radial or single-point routes. the former multi-day tour is converted to short, even single-day trips. at the same time new tourism attractions and new amenities along with new forms of tourism activities emerge in this region. in addition to traditional russian historical towns and museums innovative tourism clusters appear now in different parts of the golden ring area. at the same time parts of the former golden ring route are integrated in new regional tourism products. transformation of tourist destinations together with the changes in consumers' interests and demand had notably diversified types of tourism in the golden ring of russia. if formerly this route was aimed mainly at cultural tourism, now there are ecotourism, leisure, family, business, event and other types of tourism developing here. but it is necessary to differentiate regional tourism destinations by working out their distinct tourism specialization, to distinguish and diversify local tourism brands and programs.
stealth_technology	nano-barium ferrite bafe13o14 was prepared by self-propagating combustion synthesis. xrd, sem and laser granularity analyzer were used to characterize the structure, micrographic morphology and particle size of products. the results show that the purity of products is very high. it belongs to hexagonal crystal structure and magneto plumbite type ferrite. their particle size is below 50 nm. in order to research the ability of electromagnetic wave adsorption, electromagnetic parameters were measured with vector network analysis from 2 similar to 18 ghz, and the tangent value of electromagnetic loss was calculated. accordingly, the mechanism of electromagnetic wave adsorption was explained. at last, the 8 mm wave (36 ghz) attenuation tester was used to measure the property of reflection and transmission. the results show that barium ferrite bafe13o14 has a favorable property of electromagnetic wave adsorption in the range of centimeter and millimeter waves. the products can be applied in the field of stealth technology and military camouflage.
water_pollution	this paper addresses the nonlinear inverse source problem of identifying multiple unknown time-dependent point sources occurring in a 1d evolution advection-diffusion-reaction equation. we prove that time records of the associated state taken only upstream and downstream all involved source positions do not uniquely identify the unknown elements defining the sought time-dependent point sources if their number is bigger or equal to 2. then, based on some impulse response techniques we establish an identifiability theorem that under some reasonable assumptions on the time state recording positions yields uniqueness of those unknown elements. this theorem together with a data assimilation result led to develop a source detection-identification method that goes throughout the monitored domain to detect the presence of each unknown active source occurring between two state recording points. once a source is detected, the established identification procedure localizes its position, determines the total amount loaded by this source and identifies the historic of its time-dependent source intensity function. some numerical experiments on a variant of the surface water biological oxygen demand pollution model are presented.
remote_sensing	mineral forms of iron oxide, such as hematite, goethite and jarosite, are important because they are widely distributed at the earth 's surface and because they are used as indicators for mineral exploration. iron oxide abundance in rocks containing these minerals can be estimated from the absorption depth at wavelengths of around 900 nm in a reflectance spectrum, but this depth is also affected by extraneous factors such as grain size and topography. this paper investigated the effect of grain size on reflectance spectra and proposed a method for estimating iron oxide abundance in surface rocks by using remotely sensed data with suppression of the effects of grain size and topography. reflectance spectra were measured in a laboratory from rock powder samples of different grain sizes containing iron oxide minerals. while the reflectance increased with decreasing grain size, the presence of ferric iron caused the absorption depth to be almost constant at around 900 nm, irrespective of the chemical composition of the sample. in addition, the difference between the reflectance at 550 nm and 760 nm (slope) was a function of grain size. iron oxide abundance can be estimated accurately by mcr-900d, which is the maximum absorption depth at the absorption center after the effect of grain size and topography was suppressed by slope and the continuum-removal method, which takes the ratio between the original spectrum and its continuum, respectively. correlation of mcr-900d results with datasets of actual spectral and chemical iron oxide laboratory measurements revealed that the mineral forms also need to be considered. mcr-900d results were significantly correlated with rock samples classified as containing different forms of iron oxide minerals (hematite, goethite and jarosite). finally, mcr-900d was applied to an aviris dataset for the cuprite site in nevada, usa. the results represented the enrichment zones of iron oxide within hydrothermally altered areas.

rainwater_harvesting	a longitudinal harvested rainwater quality monitoring study was undertaken at 6 sites within selangor, malaysia over a period of 8 months. overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the malaysian recreational water quality class bb standards with exceptions for ph (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). a large number of samples tested positive for escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. the results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

construction_management	delay is one of the problems occurring between owners and contractors. deviation from base plans can be found using project control methods, continuous assessment of the schedule, determining progress percentages and earned value parameters. in such circumstances, conflicts might arise between contractor and owner as restoring project 's original schedule needs added expenditures by the contractor. moreover, continuation of the previous procedure and late completion of the project will cause the owner damage. in this research, a mathematical model using game theory has been presented. the model investigates the behaviour and strategies of the parties involved in a delayed project through bargaining. it helps owners and contractors gain deeper understanding of the given delay problem, get a fairly accurate analysis of their situation and consider possible strategies in facing with such circumstances without spending a long and inconclusive time. the points which both parties can agree rationally proposed with a numerical example. results of the model indicate that parameters involved in the problem are effective in changing the range width of negotiation. in special cases, such as disproportionate delay penalty, these parameters even make it neutral in negotiation. step by step analysis of the model showed which features can threaten negotiation.
green_building	the green building fund (gbf) established in 2008 as part of the clean business australia initiative is aimed at mitigating the risk of climate change by forming close partnerships between government, business and industry. it is specifically targeted to reduce the impact of the built environment on australia 's greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by reducing energy consumption through the operation of commercial office buildings. as part of the selection process, projects are assessed against three merit criteria: the potential reduction in ghg emissions, demonstration of potential, and quality of project design and management. an alternative framework is proposed that contributes more rigour to the current selection process. in particular, it contends for the use of second-order moment and markov chain to establish the present worth and feasibility of green investment where the underlying parameters of interest/discount rate and cash flows (in terms of savings) are uncertain. this framework will be useful not only to ausindustry (the funding body of the gbf) and other government departments worldwide responsible for awarding green building funds but also to owners who are keen on strengthening their application by improving the demonstration of project feasibility.
remote_sensing	the yield forecasting of corn constitutes a key issue in agricultural management, particularly in the context of demographic pressure and climate change. this study presents two methods to estimate yields using artificial neural networks: a diagnostic approach based on all the satellite data acquired throughout the agricultural season, and a real-time approach, where estimates are updated after each image was acquired in the microwave and optical domains (formosat-2, spot-4/5, terrasar-x, and radarsat-2) throughout the crop cycle. the results are based on the multispectral crop monitoring experimental campaign conducted by the cesbio (centre d'etudes de la biosphere) laboratory in 2010 over an agricultural region in southwestern france. among the tested sensor configurations (multi-frequency, multi-polarization or multi-source data), the best yield estimation performance (using the diagnostic approach) is obtained with reflectance acquired in the red wavelength region, with a coefficient of determination of 0.77 and an rmse of 6.6 q ha(-1). in the real-time approach the combination of red reflectance and c-hh backscattering coefficients provides the best compromise between the accuracy and earliness of the yield estimate (more than 3 months before the harvest), with an r-2 of 0.69 and an rmse of 7.0 q ha-1 during the development of the central stem. the two best yield estimates are similar in most cases (for more than 80% of the monitored fields), and the differences are related to discrepancies in the crop growth cycle and/or the consequences of pests.

water_pollution	industrial manufacturers are required to adopt water conservation and pollution control technologies because of increasingly serious water scarcity and water pollution, especially in textile industry. an effective performance evaluation tool for these technologies is greatly needed for textile manufacturers. however, the existing tools for textile industry can only evaluate on plant level and ignore pollution effect of water consumption. in order to help textile manufacturers know about water conservation and pollution control performance of technologies more systematically and comprehensively, we developed a process-level water conservation and pollution control performance evaluation tool of cleaner production technology in textile industry. the new tool includes three indicators: water withdrawal reduction, water consumption reduction and water assimilation reduction. comparison between the new tool and old ones by evaluating the low-pollution-concentration effluent reuse technology in a polyester flannel fabric dyeing and printing plant demonstrates that the new tool can help textile manufacturers to not only understand operation mechanism of a technology on specific processes and then take specific improvement measures on different processes to optimize water conservation and pollution control performance, but also find out indiscoverable disadvantages of a technology and then adopt complementary technologies to reduce negative effect of the technology.

solar_energy	this paper addresses evaporation under vacuum condition with the aid from solar energy and the recovered waste heat from the vacuum pump. it is a preliminary attempt to design an innovative solar-based evaporation system under vacuum. the design details, equipment required, theoretical background and work methodology are covered in this article. theoretically, based on the energy provided by the sun during the day, the production rate of pure water can be around 15 kg/m(2)/day. assumptions were made for the worst case scenario where only 30% of the latent heat of evaporation is recycled and the ability of the dark droplet to absorb sun energy is around 50%. both the waste heat from the pump and the heat collected from the photovoltaic (pv) panels are proposed to raise the temperature of the inlet water to the system to its boiling point at the selected reduced pressure.

green_building	in recent years, green building has attracted wide attention from both academia and industry. as green building projects are inevitably plagued with risks, this study attempted to assess the risks in green building projects in singapore. categorizing a list of 28 risk factors into 11 groups, the study performed a questionnaire survey and received 31 responses from project managers in singapore. a risk assessment model was developed using the fuzzy synthetic evaluation approach. using the proposed model, the likelihood of occurrence, magnitude of impact and risk criticality of each risk factor, group and the overall risk were calculated. ""inaccurate cost estimation"" was the top risk factor, and ""cost overrun risk"" was the most critical risk group. the overall risk criticality was high, implying risk management was still necessary for green construction in singapore. the proposed risk assessment model is reliable and practical for professionals in the green building industry, and can be applied in risk assessment in other countries. as few studies focused on risks in green projects, this study expands the knowledge and literature.

remote_sensing	the traditional approach of map accuracy assessment based on an error matrix does not capture the spatial variation in classification accuracy. here, per-pixel accuracy prediction methods are proposed based on interpolating accuracy values from a test sample in which the reference class of each sampled pixel has been determined. different accuracy prediction methods were developed based on four factors: predictive domain (spatial versus spectral), interpolation function (constant, linear, gaussian, and logistic), incorporation of class information (interpolating each class separately versus grouping them together), and sample size. developing accuracy maps using the spectral domain is a new approach in contrast to previous efforts based on the spatial domain. performance of the prediction methods was evaluated using 26 test blocks, with 10 km x 10 km dimensions, dispersed throughout the united states. each block had complete coverage reference data manually extracted by interpreters and a land-cover map produced from landsat imagery using a decision tree classification. the full scene maps were then compared to the corresponding reference maps to produce complete coverage accuracy information for each block. the predicted accuracy maps were produced from a sample of the reference data (i.e., the test dataset). the performance of the sample-based accuracy predictions was evaluated using the area under the curve (auc) of the receiver operating characteristic. relative to existing accuracy prediction methods, our proposed methods resulted in improvements of auc of 0.15 or greater. evaluation of the four factors comprising the accuracy prediction methods demonstrated that: i) interpolations should be done separately for each class instead of grouping all classes together; ii) if an all-classes approach is used, the spectral domain will result in substantially greater auc than the spatial domain; iii) for the smaller sample size and per-class predictions, the spectral and spatial domain yielded similar auc; iv) for the larger sample size (i.e., very dense spatial sample) and per-class predictions, the spatial domain yielded larger auc; v) increasing the sample size improved accuracy predictions with a greater benefit accruing to the spatial domain; and vi) the function used for interpolation had the smallest effect on auc. to conclude, the ability to produce per-pixel accuracy predictions yielding simple to understand accuracy maps opens up new possibilities for error propagation of remotely sensed products in a variety of disciplines.

suspension_bridge	the buffeting response of a suspension bridge in complex terrain is studied based on full-scale data from sonic anemometers and accelerometers installed on the lysefjord bridge in norway. the influence of the topography on the wind field and the associated effects on the displacement response are investigated. the two main wind conditions observed display different characteristics, which requires a case by case approach, and a refined description of the wind co-coherence. the identification of the mode shapes and modal damping ratios is carried out using ambient vibration data as a verification procedure. the buffeting response of the bridge is computed in the frequency domain, and compared to the recorded response in terms of standard deviation and power spectral density of the displacement response. the overall comparison is found satisfactory, although some discrepancies are observed. these are attributed to large yaw angles and non-stationary wind fluctuations caused by the influence of a complex topography on the flow properties.

ambient_intelligence	many efforts today aim to energy saving, promoting the user 's awareness and virtuous behavior in a sustainability perspective. our houses, appliances, energy meters and devices are becoming smarter and connected, domotics is increasing possibilities in house automation and control, and ambient intelligence and assisted living are bringing attention onto people 's needs from different viewpoints. our assumption is that considering these aspects together allows for novel intriguing possibilities. to this end, in this paper we combine home energy management with domotics, coordination technologies, intelligent agents, ambient intelligence, ubiquitous technologies and gamification to devise novel scenarios, where energy monitoring and management is just the basic brick of a much wider and comprehensive home management system. the aim is to control home appliances well beyond energy consumption, combining home comfort, appliance scheduling, safety constraints, etc. with dynamically-changeable users' preferences, goals and priorities. at the same time, usability and attractiveness are seen as key success factors: so, the intriguing technologies available in most houses and smart devices are exploited to make the system configuration and use simpler, entertaining and attractive for users. these aspects are also integrated with ubiquitous and pervasive technologies, geo-localization, social networks and communities to provide enhanced functionalities and support smarter application scenarios, hereby further strengthening technology acceptation and diffusion. accordingly, we first analyse the system requirements and define a reference multi-layer architectural model - the butlers architecture - that specifies seven layers of functionalities, correlating the requirements, the corresponding technologies and the consequent value-added for users in each layer. then, we outline a set of notable scenarios of increasing functionalities and complexity, discuss the structure of the corresponding system patterns in terms of the proposed architecture, and make this concrete by presenting some comprehensive interaction examples as comic strip stories. next, we discuss the implementation requirements and how they can be met with the available technologies, discuss a possible architecture, refine it in the concrete case of the tucson coordination technology, present a subsystem prototype and discuss its properties in the butlers perspective.
water_pollution	yeasts from water sources have been associated with diseases ranging from superficial mucosal infections to life threatening diseases. the aim of this study was to determine the water quality as well as diversity and antifungal susceptibility of yeasts from two rivers. yeast levels and physicochemical parameter data were analyzed by principal component analysis to determine correlations between physico-chemical data and yeast levels. yeast morphotypes were identified by biochemical tests and 26s rrna gene sequencing. disk diffusion antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted. physico-chemical parameters of the water were within target water quality range (twqr) for livestock farming. for irrigational use, total dissolved solids and nitrates were not within the twqr. yeast levels ranged between 27 +/- 10 and 2,573 +/- 306 cfu/l. only non-pigmented, ascomycetous yeasts were isolated. saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida glabrata were most frequently isolated. several other opportunistic pathogens were also isolated. a large number of isolates were resistant to azoles, especially fluconazole, but also to other antifungal classes. candida species were resistant to almost all the antifungal classes. these water sources are used for recreation and religious as well as for watering livestock and irrigation. of particular concern is the direct contact of individuals with opportunistic yeast, especially the immune-compromised. resistance of these yeast species to antifungal agents is a further health concern.
rainwater_harvesting	remote sensing applications in water resources management are becoming an essential asset in all different levels of integrated water rational use. due to remote sensing data availability and different acquisition sensors of satellite images, a wide variability of benchmarks could be conducted under the same theme. rainwater harvesting is the branch of science where the rainwater is the main target to improve groundwater recharge, stratocumulus clouds are the main source of rain in arid regions. cloud detection using remote sensing techniques proved to be efficient recently but the general uses of different cloud detection techniques are to precisely omit clouds from satellite images. the use of cloud detection scheme described herein is designed for the meris level1b data; therefore, total set of 60 meris images was collected on monthly basis for 5 years started from january 2008. the use of the cloud detection algorithm is to find proper land cover suitable for rainwater harvesting mostly covered with cloud all over the year. evaluation of land use for rainwater harvesting in terms of groundwater recharge is considered, several factors were taken into consideration and ndwi is one of the most important factors involved. results pointed out that some regions in southern saudi arabia are qualified enough to be considered as potential sites for better rainwater harvesting.
rainwater_harvesting	information about the quality of rural drinking water sources can be used to manage their safety and mitigate risks to health. sanitary surveys, which are observational checklists to assess hazards present at water sources, are simpler to conduct than microbial tests. we assessed whether sanitary survey results were associated with measured indicator bacteria levels in rural drinking water sources in kisii central, kenya. overall, thermotolerant coliform (ttc) levels were high: all of the samples from the 20 tested dug wells, almost all (95%) of the samples from the 25 tested springs, and 61% of the samples from the 16 tested rainwater harvesting systems were contaminated with ttc. there were no significant associations between ttc levels and overall sanitary survey scores or their individual components. contamination by ttc was associated with source type (dug wells and springs were more contaminated than rainwater systems). while sanitary surveys cannot be substituted for microbial water quality results in this context, they could be used to identify potential hazards and contribute to a comprehensive risk management approach.
remote_sensing	this study explores using passive microwave (pmw) rainfall estimation for spatial and temporal adjustment of precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks-cloud classification system (persiann-ccs). the persiann-ccs algorithm collects information from infrared images to estimate rainfall. persiann-ccs is one of the algorithms used in the integrated multisatellite retrievals for gpm (global precipitation mission) estimation for the time period pmw rainfall estimations are limited or not available. continued improvement of persiann-ccs will support integrated multisatellite retrievals for gpm for current as well as retrospective estimations of global precipitation. this study takes advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution of geo-based persiann-ccs estimation and the more effective, but lower sample frequency, pmw estimation. the probability matching method (pmm) was used to adjust the rainfall distribution of geo-based persiann-ccs toward that of pmw rainfall estimation. the results show that a significant improvement of global persiann-ccs rainfall estimation is obtained.
construction_management	problems in existing methods of production tracking in off-site construction result in schedule delays and increased costs. to eliminate these deficiencies, an autonomous production tracking that analyzes real-time production data is proposed. a specific implementation of the proposed production tracking mechanisms has been developed for a large off-site construction plant in australia, and is in the process of installation. the paper shows that: (i) the production model in off-site construction is always nonlinear in the outcome due to the presence of variability (ii) in systems with a periodic production target, deviation from the schedule converges to zero at the end of production period and the same downward trend should be followed in designing plan buffers and (iii) long-term production performance in off-site construction can autonomously be monitored and controlled by observing critical variables of production. the paper provides those who manage off-site construction with recommendations on effective production tracking and management. the models and propositions in this research are of practical value and can be used to detect impending production shortfalls against periodic targets in the short-term, and adjust capacity parameters and production targets in long-term planning.

rainwater_harvesting	goat production is an important agricultural activity in jordan. the country is one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of water scarcity. provision of sufficient quantity of good quality drinking water is important for goats to maintain feed intake and production. this study aimed to evaluate the seasonal availability and quality of goats' drinking water sources, accessibility, and utilization in different zones in the karak governorate in southern jordan. data collection methods comprised interviews with purposively selected farmers and quality assessment of water sources. the provision of drinking water was considered as one of the major constraints for goat production, particularly during the dry season (ds). long travel distances to the water sources, waiting time at watering points, and high fuel and labor costs were the key reasons associated with the problem. all the values of water quality (wq) parameters were within acceptable limits of the guidelines for livestock drinking wq with exception of iron, which showed slightly elevated concentration in one borehole source in the ds. these findings show that water shortage is an important problem leading to consequences for goat keepers. to alleviate the water shortage constraint and in view of the depleted groundwater sources, alternative water sources at reasonable distance have to be tapped and monitored for water quality and more efficient use of rainwater harvesting systems in the study area is recommended.
suspension_bridge	a benchmark problem for modal identification of a cable-stayed bridge was proposed by a research team at hong kong polytechnic university. by taking an instrumented cable-stayed bridge as a test bed, nineteen sets of vibration records with known/unknown excitations were provided to invited researchers. in this paper, the vibration responses of the bridge under a series of excitation conditions are examined to estimate the wind and traffic-induced variations of its dynamic characteristics. firstly, two output-only experimental modal identification methods are selected. secondly, the bridge and its monitoring system are described and the nineteen sets of vibration records are analyzed in time-domain and frequency-domain. excitations sources of blind datasets are predicted based on the analysis of excitation conditions of known datasets. thirdly, modal parameters are extracted by using the two selected output-only modal identification methods. the identified modal parameters are examined with respect to at least two different conditions such as traffic- and typhoon-induced loadings. finally, the typhoon-induced effects on dynamic characteristics of the bridge are estimated by analyzing the relationship between the wind velocity and the modal parameters.
rainwater_harvesting	soil erosion is a serious environmental threat in the mediterranean region due to torrential rainfalls, and it contributes to the degradation of agricultural land. techniques such as rainwater harvesting may improve soil water storage and increase agricultural productivity, which could result in more effective land usage. reservoir tillage is an effective system of harvesting rainwater, but it has not been scientifically evaluated like other tillage systems. its suitability for the conditions in spain has not been determined. to investigate and quantify water storage from reservoir tillage and how it could be adapted to improve infiltration of harvested rainwater, a laboratory-scale rainfall simulator was developed. rainfall characteristics, including rainfall intensity, spatial uniformity and raindrop size, confirm that natural rainfall conditions are simulated with sufficient accuracy. the simulator was auto-controlled by a solenoid valve and three pressure nozzles were used to spray water corresponding to five rainfall intensities ranging from 36 to 112 mm h(-1) for 3 to 101-year return period with uniformity coefficients between 83 and 94%. in order to assess the reservoir tillage method under surface slopes of 0, 5, and 10%, three soil scooping devices with identical volume were used to make depressions in the following forms: a) truncated square pyramid, b) triangular prism, and c) truncated cone. these depressions were compared to a control soil surface with no depression. for the loam soil used in this study, results show that reservoir tillage was able to reduce soil erosion and surface runoff and significantly increase infiltration. there was significant difference between the depressions and the control. compared to the control, depression (a) reduced surface runoff by about 61% and the sediment yield concentration by about 79%.

water_pollution	theories that explain the governance of water, such as integrated river basin management and multilevel water governance, point to scalar configurations of power as critical determinants of success (or failure). this article explains how the scalar configurations of power in water governance mirror those of the chinese state, and influence water governance in powerful ways. we use the case of the yangtze river and shanghai, a megacity in the yangtze estuary, as examples, showing how a local jurisdiction exercises its regulatory measures against different types of transjurisdictional water pollution and how these regulatory measures mirror the fluidity (or rigidity) of power configurations in hydropolitics in china. china 's evolving water resource management institutions are as yet unable to address the scalar configurations of power in water governance.
rainwater_harvesting	availability of safe drinking water is considered a key challenge in the coastal region of bangladesh. high concentrations of salinity, iron and arsenic, and the unavailability of suitable aquifers, have deterred the exploitation of groundwater resources. in addition the cyclonic storm surge is a major threat to this system. cyclones accompanied by storm surges in the coastal area cause significant deterioration of drinking water supply and sanitation. water professionals have launched some initiatives to promote small-scale, alternative safe water sources (e. g. rainwater harvesting, pond sand filters and piped water techniques) to provide sustainable solutions to the problem. however, a systematic evaluation of the alternatives that considers social, technical and economic criteria has not been carried out so far. the present study is an attempt to evaluate the alternative options for drinking water supply in a cyclone-prone area. the authors conducted a multi-criteria analysis and reached the conclusion that rainwater harvesting is the most suitable option for the area. moreover, the final result was shared with the users to obtain their feedback to ensure sustainability of the water source.
ambient_intelligence	monitoring message workflow transmission is a very challenging problem, especially in pervasive environments, mainly because of the wide range of unexpected events (e.g. human and material resources unavailability) and context changes (e.g. source and target localizations) that may occur at run-time. in this paper, we propose an information system and services orchestration framework enabling intelligent message routing policy adaptation. our objective is to build a reliable routing strategy that can autonomously and intelligently adapt its own behavior and decisions according to source and target context changes as well as to controlled message status (e.g. exceeded deadlines for message reception). we present a solution that emphasizes some cutting-edge characteristics that we believe are crucial for enhancing the quality of message communication, such as intelligence, controllability, scalability, adaptivity and personalization. the routing decisions can be adapted at different levels of decision-making such as message itinerary, delay for message treatment, etc., by means of advanced ai methods that we detail for some of the most sensitive self-adaptive services.
green_building	this paper provides a critical review on the building neighborhood properties influencing the energy and airflows in urban neighborhoods. specifically, the review focus is on the multi-scale modeling required to quantify this influence of the building neighborhood properties on the energy consumption in buildings. the energy consumption patterns of buildings located in dense city centers are highly dependent on the surrounding urban neighborhood, compared to the low density, suburban/rural regions, where the building energy consumption patterns are similar to an isolated building energy consumption patterns. due to the complex nature of the outdoor airflow around the buildings in urban neighborhoods, a practical modeling approach utilizes multi-scale modeling to account for different spatial and temporal scales for the relevant transport processes. specifically, this modeling approach aims to identify the most important neighborhood properties influencing building energy consumption. the urban morphology parameters, such as the urban plan area density, frontal area density, and mean height of the buildings represent successful examples of emerging properties suitable for development of generalized solutions and physical models at the neighborhood scale. this paper also reviews different modeling approaches that account for the impacts of the urban neighborhood properties on the thermo-fluid property of the air, surfaces, and sky in the built environment as the required inputs for accurate assessment of building energy consumption. furthermore, these emerging properties of urban neighborhoods directly affect (1) the mitigation strategies for a better adaptation, (2) design performance metrics of neighborhoods for the green building rating systems, and (3) socio-environmental factors.

construction_management	the instituto de astronomia of the universidad nacional autonoma de mexico (unam) along with instituto nacional de astrofisica, optica y electronica, the university of arizona and the smithsonian astrophysical observatory are developing the telescopio san pedro martir (tspm) project, a 6.5m diameter optical telescope. m3 engineering & technology corp. (m3) is the design and construction management firm responsible for all site infrastructure, enclosure and support facilities. the telescopio san pedro martir project (tspm) will be located within the san pedro martir national park in baja california, mexico at 2,830 m. above sea level, approximately 65 km. east of the pacific ocean, 55km west of the sea of cortes (gulf of california) and 180km south of the united states and mexico border. the aim of the paper is to present the preliminary design of the site infrastructure, enclosure and support facilities to date and share the design and construction approach.
geotextile	inappropriate management practices on cerrado soil cause some of the most important negative impacts on this ecosystem, especially converting native vegetation on pastures and crops plantation. significantly losses of natural cerrado have been reported and current remaining natural vegetation area is smaller than other land cover. therefore, sustainable practices are required to recover and protect the biome. for that reason this work aimed to evaluate the effect of grass and legumes species on coir geotextile during a seasonal cycle of rain and drought on soil of abandoned pasture of cerrado in southeastern brazil. several soil parameters were examined, including their physical and chemical compositions, microbial biomass c (smb-c), and microbial viability. the plant species used were andropogon gayanus (cgg coir geotextile grass) and calopogonium mucunoides and arachis pintoi (cgl coir geotextile legumes). in general, cgl had more beneficial effects on soil fertility than cgg in terms of total soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. the cgl treatment showed smb-c values twice those of the control, and 28% higher than cgg. microbial populations (actinobacteria and fungi) increased in cgg and cgl, being the better improvement on microbial growth observed on. cgl. actinobacteria was the most prevalent group both on the soil surface and at greater depths. our results indicated that calopogonium mucunoides is a very aggressive species and inhibits the growth of arachis pintoi. the appropriate use of geotextiles, associated with non-weed and non-alien vegetation, represents a viable technique for improving total soc and smb-c, nutrients as nitrogen and phosphorus, and increase the microbial populations.

construction_management	the construction industry is experiencing changes in the tools and techniques used in the planning for high productivity, safety, and sustainability. these changes have not been seen much in the preconstruction planning (pcp) stage. the pcp is highly individualistic in nature, in which planners/contractors use their past experience to plan a project within the constraints of time, cost, and quality. the use of planning techniques in the pcp stage has been the subject of research, development, and implementation for a long time; however, at present, importance is being placed on the use of different tools. tools like knowledge-based systems, computer graphics, and a combination of the two have been reported in the literature. literature also suggests the use of geographic information systems (gis) as a recent tool in the pcp stage. a structure that is to be developed becomes an important component of its neighborhood. it is closely related to all other existing facilities in its surroundings; hence, its construction should not be planned in isolation but in reference to its locality, existing facilities/utilities, topography, and so on. in the pcp stage, consideration should be given to its surroundings, in which the use of gis has been found to be helpful. therefore, the primary objective of the present study is to explore the potential application areas of gis, as a tool, in the pcp stage. the present study informs practitioners in the construction industry about the application areas of gis for their wider use in real-life projects. finally, research areas worthy for further investigation are highlighted.(c) 2015 american society of civil engineers.
construction_management	case-based reasoning (cbr) has been widely adopted in construction management (cm) research due to the similar mind-sets of cbr and cm problem solving. however, to date, there has been no systematic review of cbr applications in previous cm studies, raising the question of what is the current status quo of cbr applications in cm research? by using the method of content analysis, this study provides a comprehensive literature review of cm cbr articles published between 1996 and january 2015. it is found that the popularity of cbr applications in cm research is increasing, especially after 2006, with a majority emanating from south korea. in addition, 17 cbr application fields are identified, with the primary research interests focusing on construction cost estimation, construction tendering, bidding and procurement, and environment and sustainability management. issues in previous cbr model developments are also identified, mainly related to model hypothesis-testing, reuse of case outcomes, selection of model development methods, use of derivational analogy and automated implementation, together with future research suggestions and directions. this study helps provide cm academics and practitioners with a more comprehensive understanding of the development of cbr applications and implications for future studies.

geotextile	the installation of offshore scour protection systems in offshore wind farms allows avoid the effect of scour phenomenon around these structures. up to date, numerous research projects have been carried out to justify the necessity of the scour protection systems and also to optimize their design. protection systems based on riprap is frequently used due to its low cost and easy availability compared to other solutions such as geotextile bags or prefabricated concrete blocks. the sizing of these structures can be performed according to a series of recommendations that can optimize the costs associated with them, but there have been only few studies with real data up to now which have allowed identify the need for such protections. this investigation aims to assess the functionality of the scour protections adopted through the available data about their characteristics and the scour depth developed around the foundations. in this sense, this paper presents the results of a study that analyzes the functionality of scour protections in different european offshore wind farms.
construction_management	this paper examines the handover process in norwegian construction industry, focusing on commercial buildings. improving handover processes reduces the number of conflicts, increases user value, improves indoor climate along with securing overall building performance, both in closing construction phases as well as throughout the building lifetime. as little research is found on the subject, a collective project was initiated by the municipality of trondheim. this case study is limited to a single, environmentally certified, office building in norway. the paper aims to determine main delay and defect causes. finally, some countermeasures are identified. a literature review along with a document study was performed. seven semi-structured, case specific interviews were conducted in addition to a pilot study consisting of three interviews on the same topic. the case respondents are project managers from contractor and client with extensive experience from the norwegian construction industry. several causes in contractor-client interfaces were identified. among the most critical were late changes and decision-making, lacking understanding of limitations and potential in design-build contracts, conflicting interpretation of specification of work along with complex technical installations. possible countermeasures are found to be strict decision planning, sufficient time buffers, early reconciliation of client expectations together with sufficiently detailed specification of work and significant specialist knowledge in complex technical coordination. this paper investigates a little scrutinized part of norwegian construction projects in an effort to better commercial building performance and profitability. future research on multiple construction projects would help confirm or disprove findings and the identified countermeasures.

green_building	coupled green-building roof system can assess bidirectional heat-flux with indoor space. two high-rise residential blocks in humid-subtropical hong kong, with and without roof building thermal insulation (bti), were monitored for thermal performance across seasons and weather conditions. each block had three plots: sedum and herbaceous peanut green roofs, plus bare control. diurnal heat-flux data were partitioned into daytime and nighttime, and positive and negative fractions. on hot summer-sunny day, control without bti facilitates notable daytime influx and nighttime efflux of heat. sedum augments thermal-mass effect pushing more heat indoor than control. with balance between transpirationcooling and heat-sink formation, peanut registers intermediate heat gain. adding bti raises heat-gain and eliminates control heat-loss, curtails sedum heat-gain, and maintains peanut heat-gain. bti partnering with green roof offer synergistic thermal benefit by increasing thermal mass, thermal capacity and thermal resistance to furnish thermal buffering, thermal lag, and extending heat ingress to nighttime. lower solar-radiation input on summer-cloudy day significantly trims heat gain at control, with limited reduction at both green roofs. summer-rainy day brings further drop in heat gain. for cloudy and rainy scenarios, heat-gain suppression is more notable with bti. interpretations for other season-weather conditions and implications of the findings are elaborated.

smart_material	magnetorheological (mr) fluids are a new type of smart material whose performance can be evaluated by considering three important factors: stability, viscosity, and shear yield stress of the fluids. in this study, to produce fine, antisettling, and well-dispersed mr fluids, appropriate components and preparation techniques were adopted and a surface treatment method was developed involving different surfactants. property tests of the mr fluids were conducted, and the results demonstrated that the proposed preparation method decelerated the sedimentation of mr fluids, that the viscosity of the mr fluids varied with temperature and shear rate, and that liquid paraffin can reduce the viscosity of the mr fluids more gradually than oleic acid. in addition, variations in shear yield stress with magnetic induction intensity and volume fraction were determined. to accurately describe the shear yield stress of the mr fluids, a limited chain model that considers the spatial distribution of carbonyl iron (ci) particles, model size, and magnetic saturation phenomenon was proposed. a comparison between the theoretical and experimental values obtained in this study indicates that a seventh-order limited chain model can effectively calculate the shear stress of mr fluids.

ambient_intelligence	analyzing activities (either static postures or movements) made by a user is a complex process that can be done through a wide range of approaches. one part of these existing approaches support doing the recognition focusing their analysis on specific body parts. in fact, in previous publications a method was introduced for activity recognition (body-angles algorithm) capable of analysing only using a single sample of those activitites and allowing the selection for each activity which are the relevant joints. but being able to analyse the body of the user selecting only a subset of the same, has both advantages and disadvantages. therefore throughout this article we will expose those disadvantages, the applied solution to mitigate them and the results of an evaluation destined to clear which body parts make it easier to obtain high accuracy rates in recognition. through this work we aim to give the scientific community lessons learned about the usage of different body areas in the analysis of activity recognition.
ambient_intelligence	in this paper we explore how future smart environments can be given a sense of humor. humor requires smartness. entering witty remarks in a conversation requires understanding of the conversation, the conversational partner, the context and the history of the conversation. we can try to model interaction smartness and how to use it in creating not only witty remarks, but also to create humorous events. smart sensors and actuators, embedded in our environments and our wearables allow us to make changes to a digitally enhanced physical environment. witty remarks in language can have their counterpart in witty events in digital environments, including social media environments with their own communication characteristics. sequential and parallel juxtapositions of incongruous and contrasting events invade our communication and, in addition, can be expected to emerge or to be created in digitally enhanced physical environments too, accidentally and intentionally.
stealth_technology	the rcs characteristics of stealth modified three-surface aircraft are analyzed in this paper. prototype a is built with catia software and the three-dimensional digital models of modified stealth three-surface b and c are also designed based on carrier-based aircraft su-33; the numerical simulation of rcs characteristics of three-surface aircraft is conducted with rcsansys software based on physical optics method and the method of equivalent currents; the following results are obtained by comparative analysis and mathematical statistics: ( 1) by the use of physical optics method and equivalent electromagnetic current method, the scattering intensity for each part of the model and rcs characteristic of the aircraft can be analyzed efficiently and accurately; ( 2) compared with model a, the mean rcs value of model b is reduced to 14.1% in forward direction and 48.1% in lateral direction; ( 3) compared with model a, the mean rcs value of model c decreases to 11.4% in forward direction and 21.6% in lateral direction. the results are expected to provide theoretical basis and technical support to the conceptual design of aircraft and stealth technology research.
construction_management	once student learning approaches have been identified, the instructor can remove or mitigate factors that encourage surface learning and develop their course to encourage deep learning. when instructors organize appropriate learning activities to ensure that students engage in active learning, civil engineering students are more likely to develop a deep approach toward learning. therefore, identifying civil engineering students' learning approaches is an important factor in their academic success. the present study examined the learning approaches of civil engineering students in three universities in turkey and the extent to which their learning approaches were related to gender, age, type of university, year of study, and construction management course success. data were collected from civil engineering students in undergraduate programs at three different universities using the revised two-factor study process questionnaire (r-spq-2f). the questionnaire was directly administered to students, and 174 participants responded to the survey. the study findings revealed week correlations of learning approaches with age and year of education, and moderate correlations between learning approaches and construction management success.
green_building	green building (gb) has been actively promoted in many countries, but it has not become the mainstream in chinese construction industry due to various reasons. this paper aims to investigate the major driving factors for the development of gb with reference of the chinese construction market. twenty-one factors influencing the development of gb were identified through a literature review, questionnaire survey, and face-to-face interview with professionals in the construction industry. structural equation model was established to identify the critical driving path and three critical factors hierarchies. the result of model analysis also verifies the theoretical hypotheses that government body is the biggest motivation for the development of gb, and the path coefficient is high. the results demonstrate the necessity for the formulation of incentive policies and power of gb propaganda. we identify distinct government and market effects and then induce a government-led gb development path. these findings provide a valuable reference for government body aiming at promoting gb in the construction industry to put forward relevant policies and incentives and for the market body to understand the major driving factors and path when making decisions.
solar_energy	solar energy is considered to be an alternative sustainable energy source in the urban environment. the potential of using solar energy in urban areas is highly dependent on urban morphology which affects the level of solar irradiance received by individual buildings. many studies focus on solar energy potential of building form in urban areas but relatively few studies examine how urban morphology affects solar energy potential of urban neighbourhoods. it leads to inefficient design of neighbourhoods in terms of solar energy potential. the present study investigates the potential of exploiting solar energy in dar es salaam, tanzania by using numerical modelling of solar irradiance on building roofs and facades. it is shown that there is substantial solar irradiance received by building roofs in all four study neighbourhoods and urban morphology has considerable effects on annual solar irradiance. solar irradiance of different orientations of tilted roofs and facades is subject to seasonality of the solar azimuth angle. it is suggested that such abundant solar energy sources would provide solutions to accommodate the increasing energy demand and to improve living quality in urban areas due to the rapid urbanization of the city.

rainwater_harvesting	current centralized urban water supply depends largely on energy consumption, creating critical water-energy challenge especially for many rapid growing asian cities. in this context, harvesting rooftop rainwater for non-potable use has enormous potential to ease the worsening water-energy issue. for this, we propose a geographic information system (gis)-simulation-based design system (gsbds) to explore how rainwater harvesting systems (rwhss) can be systematically and cost-effectively designed as an innovative water-energy conservation scheme on a city scale. this gsbds integrated a rainfall data base, water balance model, spatial technologies, energy-saving investigation, and economic feasibility analysis based on a case study of eight communities in the taipei metropolitan area, taiwan. addressing both the temporal and spatial variations in rainfall, the gsbds enhanced the broad application of rwhs evaluations. the results indicate that the scheme is feasible based on the optimal design when both water and energy-savings are evaluated. rwhss were observed to be cost-effective and facilitated 21.6% domestic water-use savings, and 138.6 (kwh/year-family) energy-savings. furthermore, the cost of per unit-energy-saving is lower than that from solar pv systems in 85% of the rwhs settings. hence, rwhss not only enable water-savings, but are also an alternative renewable energy-saving approach that can address the water-energy dilemma caused by rapid urbanization.
geotextile	the internal shear strength of geosynthetic clay liners (gcls) can be evaluated through direct shear testing in accordance with astm d6243 under a specific set of boundary conditions for a given normal stress. in order to prevent slippage at the gcl gripping system interface and ensure an internal shear failure of the gcl, a gripping surface made of spikes 1 to 2 mm tall mounted on a rigid substrate is recommended in the standard method and has been commonly used. it is recognized that certain boundary effects exist as a result of the aggressive gripping system. to improve the hydraulic performance and/or protect the bentonite core, a multi-component gcl is designed to have a thin membrane or film laminated or glued to one of the carrier geotextiles. it is necessary to investigate the boundary effect on the multi-component gcl internal shear strength tests, because the film or membrane geotextile interface is more prone to interference from the rough gripping surface recommended by the current standard. a series of internal shear strength tests were conducted on the same multi-component gcl product under different gripping conditions. it was found that tests using the aggressive gripping system yield a significantly higher peak shear strength of the multi-component gcl and a lower residual shear strength at large displacements.
smart_material	optical frequency domain reflectometry (ofdr) with the use of polarization maintaining fiber (pmf) is capable of distinguishing strain and temperature, which is critical for successful field applications such as structural health monitoring (shm) and smart material. location-dependent measurement sensitivities along pmf are compensated by cross-and auto-correlations measurements of the spectra form a distributed parameter matrix. simultaneous temperature and strain measurement accuracy of 1 mu strain and 0.1 degrees c is achieved with 2.5mm spatial resolution in over 180m range.
rainwater_harvesting	solar pasteurization is effective in reducing the level of indicator organisms in stored rainwater to within drinking water standards. however, legionella spp. were detected at temperatures exceeding the recommended pasteurization temperatures using polymerase chain reaction assays. the aim of the current study was thus to apply ema quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ema-qpcr) to determine whether the legionella spp. detected were intact cells and therefore possibly viable at pasteurization temperatures >70 degrees c. the bactiter-glo t microbial cell viability assay was also used to detect the presence of atp in the tested samples, as atp indicates the presence of metabolically active cells. chemical analysis also indicated that all anions and cations were within the respective drinking water guidelines, with the exception of iron (mean: 186.76 mu g/l) and aluminium (mean: 188.13 mu g/l), which were detected in the pasteurized tank water samples at levels exceeding recommended guidelines. the bactiter-glo t microbial cell viability assay indicated the presence of viable cells for all pasteurized temperatures tested, with the percentage of atp (in the form of relative light units) decreasing with increasing temperature [70-79 degrees c (96.7%); 80-89 degrees c (99.2%); 90-95 degrees c (99.7%)]. ema-qpcr then indicated that while solar pasteurization significantly reduced (p0.05) in the mean copy numbers was detected with an increase in the pasteurization temperature, with 6 x 10(3) genomic copies/ml dna sample obtained at 95 degrees c. as intact legionella cells were detected in the pasteurized tank water samples, quantitative microbial risk assessment studies need to be conducted to determine the potential health risk associated with using the water for domestic purposes.

ambient_intelligence	the recent advent of ambient intelligence is enabled by parallel technological advancements in sensing, context recognition, embedded systems and communications. this paper focuses on the communication issues of embedded systems, particularly the latency quality of service (qos) metric and the multi-hop communications with bluetooth standard, to examine the viability of communications of embedded systems in ami environments and applications. bluetooth is a worldwide radio license-free technology that enables the creation of low-power multi-hop networks interconnecting multiple devices. bluetooth sets the procedure to establish piconets (point-to-point and point-to-multipoint links) and scatternets (multi-hop communications), and hence, bluetooth nodes can be interconnected to form wireless networks. this paper presents research on multi-hop latency that was conducted using a custom-built test platform. moreover, an empirical model is derived to calculate the latency over asynchronous links when links in scatternets are always active or in sniff mode. the designers of ambient intelligent devices and networks can take advantage of the model and the estimation of the delay in bluetooth multi-hop networks presented in this paper.
geotextile	deterioration models for pavement surface distresses have been developed using probabilistic modelling approaches. the condition data is collected using visual inspection surveys. distress data used in the modelling include cracking, texture loss and stone loss of different pavement surfacing types. the latter includes dense graded asphalt, open graded asphalt, ultra-thin asphalt, sprayed/chip seal and geotextile seal (chip seal with geotextile underlay). probabilistic modelling approaches used include logistic regression and markov chains (mc). the two variables used in the modelling are distress rating and surface age. these models are to be used for network level management. for the network modelled herein, logistic models are found to provide predictions that are comparable with actual average condition data at different age values. it is also observed that predictions of most mc models are higher than predictions of logistic models and actual average data.
solar_energy	in this work, we demonstrated the successful construction of metal-free zero-dimensional/two-dimensional carbon nanodot (cnd)-hybridized protonated g-c3n4 (pcn) (cnd/pcn) heterojunction photocatalysts by means of electrostatic attraction. we experimentally found that cnds with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of pcn using electron microscopy analysis. the cnd/pcn-3 sample with a cnd content of 3 wt.% showed the highest catalytic activity in the co2 photoreduction process under visible and simulated solar light. this process results in the evolution of ch4 and co. the total amounts of ch4 and co generated by the cnd/pcn-3 photocatalyst after 10 h of visible-light activity were found to be 29.23 and 58.82 mu mol . g(catalyst)(-1), respectively. these values were 3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than the amounts generated when using pcn alone. the corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (aqe) was calculated to be 0.076%. furthermore, the cnd/pcn-3 sample demonstrated high stability and durability after four consecutive photoreaction cycles, with no significant decrease in the catalytic activity. the significant improvement in the photoactivity using cnd/pcn-3 was attributed to the synergistic interaction between pcn and cnds. this synergy allows the effective migration of photoexcited electrons from pcn to cnds via well-contacted heterojunction interfaces, which retards the charge recombination. this was confirmed by photoelectrochemical measurements, and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence analyses. the first-principles density functional theory (dft) calculations were consistent with our experimental results, and showed that the work function of cnds (5.56 ev) was larger than that of pcn (4.66 ev). this suggests that the efficient shuttling of electrons from the conduction band of pcn to cnds hampers the recombination of electron-hole pairs. this significantly increased the probability of free charge carriers reducing co2 to ch4 and co. overall, this study underlines the importance of understanding the charge carrier dynamics of the cnd/pcn hybrid nanocomposites, in order to enhance solar energy conversion.
suspension_bridge	thermal loads, especially thermal gradients, have a considerable effect on the behaviors of large-scale bridges throughout their lifecycles. bridge design specifications provide minimal guidance regarding thermal gradients for simple bridge girders and do not consider transversal thermal gradients in wide girder cross-sections. this paper investigates the three-dimensional thermal gradients of arch bridge girders by integrating long-term field monitoring data recorded by a structural health monitoring system, with emphasis on the vertical and transversal thermal gradients of wide concrete-steel composite girders. based on field monitoring data for one year, the time-dependent characteristics of temperature and three-dimensional thermal gradients in girder cross-sections are explored. a statistical analysis of thermal gradients is conducted, and the probability density functions of transversal and vertical thermal gradients are estimated. the extreme thermal gradients are predicted with a specific return period by employing an extreme value analysis, and the profiles of the vertical thermal gradient are established for bridge design. the transversal and vertical thermal gradients are developed to help engineers understand the thermal behaviors of concrete-steel composite girders during their service periods.
geotextile	the surface-layers have very high water content and low bearing capacity, so far to be the very soft clay foundation, which come from the reclaimed land in project of reclamation. it is difficult to improve the very soft clay foundation by traditional vacuum preloading. a new method named surface soft soil improvement is presented in this paper, which can make the soft clay foundation to be improved in preliminary. once forming the hard coat layer, the foundation may reach the needs of further construction. in the construction technology, the horizontal filter pipe net is used to instead of the sand bedding course. by laying of woven cloth and non-woven geotextile over the surface of reclaimed silt, installing pvds by manpower becomes possible. besides, the vertical pvds all are connected with the horizontal filter pipe net directly, that makes a whole spatial drainage system. the loss of the degree of vacuum is decreased, and the improvement is increased. thus, this construction technology is as a reference to the large scale engineering construction and similar projects.
smart_material	shape memory polymer (smp) is a kind of smart material, which can remember its original shape actuating by temperature. comparing to shape memory alloy, smps have large actuating deformation, low density and are convenient to fabrication. because the shape and stiffness of smp are responsible to the temperature, heating is the only actuating method to recovery of smp. this paper proposed a kind of electric heating method to actuate smp with embedded buckypaper. the sem, heating, shape recovery experimental test proved that, good bonding was formed between buckypaper and smp, uniformly distributing heating temperature and quickly smp shape recovery.
water_pollution	water pipes are considered to be one of responsible sources for the water pollution. among these sources of water supply, the water pipes are the only source of carrying out fresh or processed water into lakes, ponds and streams etc. in pakistan, knowledge on the condition of water pipes is scarce as deterioration of water pipes are hardly inspected due to high cost. the aim of the current research was to examine the quality of water pipelines of eight districts of south-punjab, namely, mianwali, khushab, layyah, bhakkar, dera ghazi khan, muzaffargarh, rajanpur and rahim yar khan. selected sampling stations were analyzed for physio-chemical parameters such as ph, total dissolve solids (tds), sulfate (so4), chlorine (cl), calcium (ca), magnesium (mg), hardness, nitrate (no3), fluoride (f) and iron (fe). the data pertaining water monitoring contain different parameters and seem difficult work for the interpretation of water quality by managing different parameters separately. for this purpose, national sanitation foundation water quality index (nsf-wqi) was determined to communicate the quality of water in a simple form. besides this, groups comprising of similar sampling sites based on water quality characteristics were identified using unsupervised technique. factor analysis (fa) has been performed for extracting the latent pollution sources that may cause the more variance in large and complex data. the calculated values of wqi from 1600 sampling stations ranging from 20.73 to 223.74 are divided into five groups; excellent to unsuitable class of waters with the average value 62.09 described as good limit for drinking water. further sampling stations are divided into five optimal clusters selected with suitable k value obtained from silhouette coefficient. results of k-means clustering are also verified with natural groups made by wqi. analysis of multivariate techniques showed several factors to be responsible for the water quality deterioration. it is found out from the fa that three latent factors such as organic pollution, agriculture run-off and urban land use caused 83.30 % of the total variation. hence, water quality management and control of these latent factors are strongly recommended.
smart_material	this paper presents the design process and measurement results of a shunted piezoelectric isolator, which can be a good compromise between a solely passive and an active isolator. the system will be used for the reduction of the vibration transmission between two idealized panels of a plane fuselage. during the design process, numerical models of both, the panel structure and the shunted isolator, are used in order to derive reduced state-space matrices. based on modal superposition, the numerical models describe the dynamic behaviour of the components and are integrated into a simulation environment of the holistic system. the required modal data is derived from experimental and numerical modal analyses of the panel. by means of an analytical description, the geometry of the shunted piezoelectric isolator is automatically optimized to defined goal parameters. applying an impedance-admittance simulation approach, both the isolator and the shunt circuit are modeled. using this simulation environment, the configuration and the performance of the shunt can be investigated and adjusted. after hardware realization of the shunted isolator, it is examined in a test setup. the results from test measurements are compared to simulation results of the system. finally, two shunted isolators are placed between a fuselage panel and an ideal mass. measurement results show the vibration reduction potential of the semi-passive system in addition to the solely passive isolation effect. this paper indicates the feasibility of shunted piezoelectric elements in addition to the passive isolation system. furthermore an effective preliminary design strategy for the layout of shunted piezoelectric isolators is presented and compared to measurement results.
ambient_intelligence	ubiquitous computing technology can be effectively utilized in shared environments where groups of people are in close proximity. shared environments are pervasive in the real world and hence the way of managing such environments will impact on not only quality of life but also business competitiveness. however, making decisions in an intelligent shared environment is never straightforward. the intelligence needs to be capable of choosing its parameters to satisfy all of its inhabitants, who have different preferences and are heterogeneous in their influences on decision. till today, there has been no thorough research to scientifically investigate this type of decision making problems, though many systems have been already deployed. this research proposes a methodology for making decisions in such circumstances. the current and future works addressed in this paper are also conductive to any human-centric networks such as service systems, since the issues addressed here are also essential constitutes of such human-centric networks.

water_pollution	traditional water distribution and irrigation systems have been used in the middle east in agriculture for thousands of years. the main objectives of the study are to investigate positive and negative environmental and social impacts of such traditional methods in three countries of the mediterranean (sudan, yemen, and palestine). to achieve these objectives, field visits, observations, interviews, and questionnaires were used. the results showed the presence of five main traditional water distribution systems in the three areas. differences in the existing systems were attributed to farmers' education level, experience, and degree of water scarcity in the area (50% of the educated farmers, more experienced farmers and water scarcity areas are adopting modern irrigation techniques, especially in palestine). preserving existing natural habitat and strengthening of social ties and relations between farmers were among the positive environmental impacts of such old methods. water losses through high evaporation (about 40% water loss), seepage and water pollution were among the negative impacts. proper planning and control, especially by public institutions, and programs for environmental awareness are some necessary actions to minimize the negative impacts in such traditional water societies. such suggested measures are specifically important to be adopted whenever modern methods of water distribution (pipelines) and irrigation (drip irrigation) are intended to be applied.
water_pollution	in the genii river basin (southern spain), agriculture is the greatest pressure on freshwater demand. furthermore, water degradation caused by soil erosion is becoming a key environmental concern. this study aims to assess the water-related impacts of agriculture combining the use of an ecohydrological model (swat) with a spatiotemporal water footprint assessment to evaluate the current status of streamflow (blue water), soil water (green water) and the assimilability of sediments by streamflow (grey water footprint). the common agricultural policy (cap) requires farmers to adopt certain agricultural practices that are beneficial for the environment. such practices could affect the conditions of available land and water resources. because of the importance of applying the best land management practices for the maintenance of sustainable water resources, the study also infers probable water availability and water pollution level changes under different post-2013 cap scenarios. the genii streamflow is highly regulated, and, as a result, it is hard to discern significant changes (p < 0.05) under the proposed scenarios. however, there is a shift with afforestation measures from unproductive (i.e., direct soil evaporation) to productive water (i.e., evapotranspired water from agricultural and natural areas, excluding non-growing periods) consumption. the probability of annual evapotranspiration from natural areas being greater in afforestation scenarios than in the baseline scenario is 0.70 to 0.88, whereas the likelihood of soil water evaporation being lower is 0.60. evapotranspiration in natural areas increases by about 521% from september to may under afforestation measures compared with the baseline scenario, whereas soil water evaporation decreases by 30% in winter. the grey water footprint and water pollution level decrease by 19% and 9%, respectively, with the highest streamflow conditions under afforestation as opposed to current conditions. however, water pollution levels of suspended solids greater than 1 indicate that the river flow is not capable of assimilating the existing sediment loads. since land use changes and agricultural practices have a major impact on water resources, the post-2013 cap reform can provide environmental benefits for water allocation and mitigation of water pollution. however, further efforts are required to better align the policy goals of the cap and the water framework directive.

green_building	the provision of healthcare creates significant environmental impacts, and their mitigation is being attempted in a variety of ways which vary from nation to nation in line with differing policy priorities and resource availability. the environmental performance of hospitals has been enhanced through, for example, green building, waste and energy management, and product design. however, unpredictable occupant behaviour, new research outcomes and evolving best practice requires healthcare to react and respond in an ever challenging and changing environment, and clearly there is no one set of actions appropriate in all jurisdictions. many authors have pointed up negative environmental impacts caused by healthcare, but these studies have focused on particular aspects of mitigation in isolation, and are for this reason not optimal. here it is argued that tackling impact mitigation through a whole system approach is likely to be more effective. to illustrate what this approach might entail in practice, an evaluation of a systematic implementation of impact mitigation in ireland 's largest teaching hospital, cork university hospital is presented. this approach brings together voluntary initiatives in particular those emanating from governmental and non-governmental organisations, peer supports and the adaptation of programmes designed originally for environmental education purposes. specific measures and initiatives are described, and analysis of results and planned future actions provides a basis for evaluation of successes achieved in achieving mitigation objectives. a crucial attribute of this approach is that it retains its flexibility and connectivity through time, thereby ensuring continual responsiveness to evolving regulation and best practice in green healthcare. it is demonstrated that implementation in cork resulted both in mitigation of existing impacts, but also a commitment to continual improvement. for such a systems approach to be widely adopted, the healthcare sector needs both leadership from regulators and stakeholders, and strong supports. in cork it was found that environmental education programmes, especially action and reward based programmes, as utilised by the campus 's academic affiliates in particular university college cork, were especially effective as a framework to address sustainability challenges and should be developed further. however, within healthcare implementation of environmental initiatives must prioritise patient safety. this approach has now been adopted for delivery across the health services sector in ireland.

remote_sensing	in this paper, we introduce a simple; but an effective algorithm to detect and image the precise location of moving targets behind obstacles based on one-transmitter and two-receiver configuration. the problem geometry together with the formulation details of the algorithm are given. the performance of the algorithm is first evaluated by synthesizing a numerical scenario that is simulated by moving ideal scatterers. then, the success and the validity of the algorithm are being assessed by an error analysis study that calculates the error associated by the approximations. the algorithm is tested with measured data obtained by an experimental set-up for detecting a human movement behind the wall. resultant two-dimensional consecutive images indicate that this algorithm can be effectively used for pinpointing the moving targets in twr or similar through-the-obstacle radar applications with good fidelity.

geotextile	in this article, the load-settlement characteristics of unreinforced and reinforced two-layered soil during the loading process are investigated. a series of bearing ratio tests was performed on a granular soil as the base layer overlaying a cohesive soil as the subgrade layer. three reinforcing conditions (unreinforced, reinforced with nonwoven geotextile, and reinforced with geogrid) at the interface of layers, with four compaction moisture contents (cmcs) of the subgrade layer and three thicknesses of the base layer for both soaked and non-soaked conditions are considered. the results show that the cmc of the subgrade layer has a significant effect on the behavior of two-layered soil, such as swelling amount and the efficiency of the reinforcements. reinforcing with geogrid resulted in a considerable increase in strength of the soaked samples due to adhesion between geogrids and clayey subgrade layer. for nonwoven geotextiles, strength of the two-layered soil decreased at shallow penetration depths due to reinforcements; and as the penetration increased in depth, the strength also increased. also, it was found that with decreases in base layer thickness, the test variable 's value (i.e., cmc), and the type of geosynthetic reinforcement have significant effects on the behavior of two-layered soil.
suspension_bridge	background: the rotator cable is an important structure providing stress shield to the rotator cuff, similar to the mechanism of suspension bridge. purpose: to evaluate the visibility and appearance of the rotator cable in various conditions of the rotator cuff, using indirect magnetic resonance (mr) arthrography. material and methods: indirect mr arthrography images from 27 patients (age range, 20-63 years) with normal rotator cuffs, and 47 (age range, 20-73 years) with tendinosis, 32 (age range, 49-71 years) with partial-thickness tears, and 55 (age range, 44-75 years) with full-thickness tears in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons (sst-ists) were included in this study. in these various rotator cuff conditions, the visibility and appearance (thickness and width) of the rotator cable and the relationships between the rotator cable appearance, rotator cuff tear size, rotator cuff thickness, and patient 's age were assessed. results: on the sagittal mr images, all rotator cables were visible in the normal rotator cuffs and tendinosis/partial-thickness tears of sst-ists. in the order of normal cuff, tendinosis, partial-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear of sst-ists, the rotator cable tended to become thicker (1.07, 1.27, 1.32, and 1.59 mm, respectively) and narrower (12.1, 10.68, 10.90, and 8.55 mm, respectively). the thickness of the rotator cable was significantly positively correlated with the rotator cuff thickness in the normal rotator cuffs (coefficient, 0.49; p = 0.010) and tendinosis of sst-ists (coefficient, 0.53; p < 0.001), but was not correlated with patients' age. conclusion: on sagittal plane of indirect mr arthrography, most rotator cables were visible. the appearance of the rotator cable changed according to the rotator cuff condition.

suspension_bridge	the izmit bay suspension bridge, app. 50 km east of istanbul, crosses the sea of samara with a main span of 1550 m. the foundation of the bridge poses interesting challenges in that the bridge site is in a highly seismic region. moreover the ground profile ranges from dolomitic limestone to a thick sandwich of silty sand and clay layers overlying the bedrock.
solar_energy	quite a few computer programs have been developed to model power plant performance. these software codes are geared toward modeling steady-state operations, which are usually sufficient for conventional power plants. solar thermal power plants undergo prolonged transient start-up and shut-down operations due to the periodic nature of solar radiation. moreover, the large size of the solar field brings about large residence time that must be considered to accurately lag power generation. a novel scheme has been developed to fine-tune steady-state solar power generation models to accurately take account of the impact of those transient operations. the suggested new scheme is implemented by adjusting solar radiation data input to the model and has been shown to clearly improve modeling accuracy by moving modeled results closer to matching real operating data.

rainwater_harvesting	geographic information system (gis) are an intelligence technique skilled to extract, store, manage and display the spatial information for various applications of water resources management. practically, arid and semi-arid environments suffer from several restrictions (e.g., lack of socio-economic and physical data, limited precipitation, and poor rain water management). in this research, remote sensing (rs) approach was integrated with gis conducted to estimate the physical variables of reservoir system (i.e., elevation-area-volume curve). first and foremost, computing an accurate and reliable elevation-area-volume curve is a challenging task for the purpose of identifying the optimal depth, minimum surface area and maximum reservoir storage. accordingly, a field study consisting of three constructed small earth dams were demonstrated the use of the geospatial approach in the western desert of iraq, where the elevation-area-volume curve was extracted. the surface areas and the reservoir volumes that were obtained from field survey and spatial intelligence techniques were compared. a comprehensive analysis have been carried out for the evaluation purposes. the results indicate that the proposed approach efficiently applied with remarkable level of accuracy.
remote_sensing	the imaging spectrometers of the second orbiting carbon observatory were radiometrically calibrated before launch during instrumentlevel ground testing. the gain and dark responses were characterized for each focal plane array detector element. an integrating sphere source with an integrated monitoring spectroradiometer illuminated the oco-2 spectrometers at many light levels. instrument output was compared with the calibrated output of the source to derive gain coefficients. this source was calibrated in situ with respect to the national institute of standards and technology reference standards, and the instrument met its absolute performance requirement of 5%. matching fields of view for the internal monitor detectors and the external instrument under test was found to be particularly important, as observed in the results and supported by modeling. temperature-dependent dark offsets were corrected in a separate process. solar spectra with varying neutral density filters were used to validate the linearity of the spectrometers.
green_building	the following paper highlights the enhancement and promotion of campania region 's rural tourism plus the green building 's importance for a kind of sustainable and competitive one, providing ideas and valuable suggestions on how natural, environmental and cultural assets of the landscape should be properly exploited. rural tourism is about values and traditions' reaffirmation, but is more than that: it also applies to an interest for rural buildings and landscape' architecture. rural tourism concerns health protection, a welfare expressed in the pleasure of life, air and water 's quality; of genuine and healthily food in an eco-friendly facility and a rural landscape used as a source of satisfaction and relax. green building means to build with the aim of ensuring people 's wellbeing, regarded as a physical and mental condition in which an individual 's health, socio-economic balance and environmental protection play a role. the ideal prototype of rural tourism will encourage all the practices making the farm and the agro-tourist accommodation service architecturally sustainable in the environmental and landscape context, promoting creative activities that are in keeping with the natural and historical setting.

remote_sensing	compressed sensing (cs) demonstrates that sparse signals can be estimated from underdetermined linear systems. distributed cs (dcs) further reduces the number of measurements by considering joint sparsity within signal ensembles. dcs with jointly sparse signals has applications in multisensor acoustic sensing, magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, remote sensing, and array signal processing. multimeasurement vector (mmv) problems consider the estimation of jointly sparse signals under the dcs framework. two related mmv settings are studied. in the first setting, each signal vector is measured by a different independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) measurement matrix, while in the second setting, all signal vectors are measured by the same i. i. d. matrix. replica analysis is performed for these two mmv settings, and the minimum mean squared error (mmse), which turns out to be identical for both settings, is obtained as a function of the noise variance and number of measurements. to showcase the application of mmv models, the mmse 's of complex cs problems with both real and complex measurement matrices are also analyzed. multiple performance regions for mmv are identified where the mmse behaves differently as a function of the noise variance and the number of measurements. belief propagation (bp) is a cs signal estimation framework that often achieves the mmse asymptotically. a phase transition for bp is identified. this phase transition, verified by numerical results, separates the regions where bp achieves the mmse and where it is suboptimal. numerical results also illustrate that more signal vectors in the jointly sparse signal ensemble lead to a better phase transition.
suspension_bridge	based on large-displacement non-linear elastic generalized variational principle, coupling effect of axial and flexural action, shearing strain energy, torsional strain energy of stiffening girder were considered, the large-displacement incomplete generalized potential energy functional of space coupling free vibration of a three-span self-anchored cable-stayed suspension bridge was presented. by constraint variation, fundamental differential equations of vertical flexural vibration, lateral flexural vibration, longitudinal vibration and torisional vibration were formulated, also presented the equations for the main tower with respect to longitudinal and lateral vibration. the linear free vibration differential equation was obtained when the nonlinear items were discarded. this approach provides theoretical basis for analysis of natural vibration character of self-anchored cable-stayed suspension bridges.
green_building	oil palm is an important industrial crop, and is usually harvested to obtain lipids and proteins. however, such biomass can be a source of important chemical biomacromolecules with several industrial applications. the aim of this work was to extract cellulose nanocrystals (cnc), cellulose nanofribrils (cnf), and lignin from pressed oil palm mesocarp fibers (popmf). initially, fibers were acetosolv pulped, resulting in two fractions: a lignin-rich black liquor and cellulose-rich pulp. lignin was recovered from the black liquor and totally chlorine-free (tcf) bleaching was applied to purify the cellulose. fibers and biomacromolecules were characterized using several methods including sem, feg/sem, tem, drx, gpc, zeta potential, tga, and ftir. the pulping-bleaching treatment improved the amount of crystalline cellulose in the pulp, yielding cnc with good thermal stability, a length of 289 nm, diameter of 11 nm, and an aspect ratio of 26. the lignin presented a high purity, with a syringyl-rich structure and good thermal stability. such characteristics highlight the potential use of popmf lignin as a green building-block and popmf nanocellulose materials as renewable biomaterials.

green_building	early prediction of the success of green building projects is an important and challenging issue. the aim of this study was to develop a model to predict the cost and schedule performance of green building projects based on the level of definition during the pre-project planning phase. to this end, a three-step process was proposed: pre-processing, variable selection, and prediction model construction. data from 53 certified green buildings were used to develop the models. after balancing the data set with respect to the proportion of cases in each of the outcome categories by pre-processing, the number of input variables was reduced from 64 to 13 and 7 for cost and schedule performance prediction respectively, using the relieff-w variable selection method. then, cost and schedule performance prediction models were constructed using the selected variables and four different classifiers: a support vector machine (svm), a back-propagation neural network (bpnn), a c4.5 decision tree algorithm (c4.5), and a logistic regression (lr). the classification performance of the four models was compared to assess their applicability. the svm models exhibited the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in predicting both the cost and schedule performance of green building projects. the results of this study empirically validated that the cost and schedule performance of green building projects is highly dependent on the quality of definition in the pre-project planning phase.

geotextile	this paper presents a case history on the performance of a coastal embankment reinforced by a layer of geotextile at the bottom of the embankment on soft marine deposits. the coastal embankment is the sea wall of the qinshan nuclear power station on the northern side of hangzhou bay near shanghai, china. monitoring of settlement and excess pore water pressure were carried out during and after embankment construction. the finite element method (fem) was used to analyse the performance of the geotextile reinforcement and its effect on soil behaviour under the embankment loading, based on the field monitored results. stability analyses were conducted using two approaches: c-phi reduction in fem, and limit equilibrium analysis. both field and simulation results indicate that the geotextile has an effect on reducing the vertical displacements of subsoil. however, the results show basal reinforcement cannot increase the overall factor of safety, but the factor of safety at the local position, under reinforcement, can be increased during the construction procedure, and this is due to the confinement of the soil element by the reinforcing fabric. thus, in these circumstances, one layer of basal geotextile reinforcement can prevent sudden failure of subsoil during embankment construction.

suspension_bridge	sliding resistance of the main cable is of the biggest concern when designing multispan suspension bridges. this paper presents a study on the layout form and sliding-resistance stability of the main cable in a double-cable multispan suspension bridge. it proposes a top cable to bottom cable layout, based on which analytical formulas for calculating the sliding-resistance coefficient of the double-cable have been derived. the formulas were verified by finite-element models (fems), and the results showed good agreement. the effects of major design parameters on the sliding resistance of the main cable were studied. analysis shows that the top cable to bottom cable layout can effectively improve the sliding resistance of the main cable, and the bottom cable of the loaded span and the top cable of the unloaded span control the antisliding design of double cable; the sliding resistance of the main cable decreases along with an increase in the ratio of tower stiffness to cable stiffness; the influence of the sag-to-span ratio on the sliding resistance of the main cable is related to the tower stiffness; and the sliding resistance of the main cable increases with an increase in the ratio of dead load to live load.

suspension_bridge	by using the nonlinear aerostatic stability theory together with the method of mean wind decomposition, a method for nonlinear aerostatic stability analysis is proposed for long-span suspension bridges under yaw wind. a corresponding program is developed considering static wind load nonlinearity and structural nonlinearity. taking a suspension bridge with three towers and double main spans as an example, the full range aerostatic instability is analyzed under wind at different attack angles and yaw angles. the results indicate that the lowest critical wind speed of aerostatic instability is gained when the initial yaw angle is greater than 0 degrees, which suggests that perhaps yaw wind poses a disadvantage to the aerostatic stability of a long span suspension bridge. the results also show that the main span in upstream goes into instability first, and the reason for this phenomenon is discussed.

remote_sensing	in this paper, a segmentation-based approach to fine registration of multispectral and multitemporal very high resolution (vhr) images is proposed. the proposed approach aims at estimating and correcting the residual local misalignment [also referred to as registration noise (rn)] that often affects multitemporal vhr images even after standard registration. the method extracts automatically a set of object representative points associated with regions with homogeneous spectral properties (i.e., objects in the scene). such points result to be distributed all over the considered scene and account for the high spatial correlation of pixels in vhr images. then, it estimates the amount and direction of residual local misalignment for each object representative point by exploiting residual local misalignment properties in a multiple displacement analysis framework. to this end, a multiscale differential analysis of the multispectral difference image is employed for modeling the statistical distribution of pixels affected by residual misalignment (i.e., rn pixels) and detect them. the rn is used to perform a segmentation-based fine registration based on both temporal and spatial correlation. accordingly, the method is particularly suitable to be used for images with a large number of border regions like vhr images of urban scenes. experimental results obtained on both simulated and real multitemporal vhr images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.
solar_energy	solar photocatalytic degradation indoor formaldehyde is an advanced technology due to its durability, stability, friendly cost and zero energy input. this article proposes a combined system of photocatalytic oxidation and trombe wall (pco/tw), which can simultaneously realize the space heating and removal of indoor contaminants. ceramic fiber paper-tio2 film was prepared by the method of dipping. depending on the complicated working conditions of the pco/tw system, the effects of multiple factors including formaldehyde concentration, humidity, temperature and light intensity on pco rate should be considered. the conversion experiments under multiple factors were conducted to investigate the performance and kinetics of ceramic fiber paper-tio2 film for photocatalytic degradation of indoor formaldehyde. the experimental factors included the typical indoor formaldehyde concentration (170-900 ppb), humidity (20%-90% rh), typical solar uv light intensity (0.21, 0.45, 0.66 and 0.90 mw/cm(2)) and temperatures (15, 25 and 45 degrees c). kinetic model simultaneously considering four explored factors was proposed. results showed the proposed kinetic model fit the experimental data very well from the degree of fitting r-2 of 0.9711 and rmsd of 7.24%. based on this four-variable kinetic model, factors optimizing for the target of increasing photocatalytic reaction rate in cold and warm seasons was analyzed and relative effective optimized measures were proposed.

water_pollution	composite nanofibers of nio/gamma-al2o3 were fabricated by sol-gel processing and electrospinning followed by calcination of precursor composite fibers of nickel acetate/aluminum acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone. calcination at high temperatures allows for preservation of the nion-al2o3 in fibrous form with a fineness of 322 +/- 69 nm in diameter. the composite fibers calcined at 800 or 1000 degrees c exhibited the nickel oxide and the gamma-alumina phases, and higher calcination temperature was found to be in favor of crystalline development. eds analysis confirmed that the ni: al ratio is about the same as the precursor formulation prepared for electrospinning. finally, photocatalytic activity of the nio/gamma-al2o3 nanofibers in comparison with tio2 nanoparticles was investigated by evaluating the photodegradation of hazardous dye rhodamine b. it was found that the as-fabricated nio/gamma-al2o3 composite nanofibers possessed a photocatalytic efficiency of 85.56%, which was nearly the same photocatalytic activity as the tio2 nanoparticles but can be recycled more easily. this work offers a direct insight into the comparison of photocatalysis of nio/gamma-al2o3 nanofibers and tio2 nanoparticles and suggests the great potential of using the developed nanofibrous nio/gamma-al2o3 for practical photocatalysis applications in various air/water pollution controls.

remote_sensing	the availability of very high resolution (vhr) optical sensors and a growing image archive that is frequently updated, allows the use of change detection in post-disaster recovery and monitoring for robust and rapid results. the proposed semi-automated gis object-based method uses readily available pre-disaster gis data and adds existing knowledge into the processing to enhance change detection. it also allows targeting specific types of changes pertaining to similar man-made objects. this change detection method is based on pre/post normalized index, gradient of intensity, texture and edge similarity filters within the object and a set of training data. once the change is quantified, based on training data, the method can be used automatically to detect change in order to observe recovery over time in large areas. analysis over time can also contribute to obtaining a full picture of the recovery and development after disaster, thereby giving managers a better understanding of productive management practices.

remote_sensing	the goal of ratio enhancement for hyperspectral (hs) image pansharpening is to obtain an enhancement ratio between a simulated low-resolution panchromatic (pan) image and an original high-resolution pan image. however, the simulated low-resolution pan image often suffers from gray-level distortion. to solve these problems, the original hs bands are synthesized to a smaller number of reduced hs bands, then the pixels of pan and hs images are divided into different groups according to the linearity between the pan band and the reduced bands. for each pixel group, a nonnegative least-squares algorithm is utilized to calculate the weights of reduced hs bands, so that the simulated pan image is obtained by weighted summation of reduced hs bands. finally, the hs image is sharpened by a ratio enhancement. the experiments demonstrated that the proposed method had a good performance on fusion quality.

solar_energy	cu2s/brass-mesh has been successfully developed as a counter electrode (ce) in a cds quantum dot sensitized solar cell (qdssc) to attain power conversion efficiency (pce) of 1.81% under front-side light illumination, equivalent to 2.01% for cu2s/brass-sheet ce based qdssc. furthermore, the cu2s/brassmesh ce achieved a pce of 0.48% upon light illumination from ce side for the first time. it appears that the cu2s/ brass-mesh ce can be used to fabricate cost-effective dual-side illuminated qdsscs for lightweight applications.

remote_sensing	this study assesses two approaches to combine observations from active and passive satellite microwave instruments in a soil moisture data assimilation system. in the first approach, labeled 'joint retrieval assimilation', a single soil moisture product is simultaneously retrieved from active and passive microwave observations, and then assimilated into the nasa catchment land surface model. in the second approach, labeled 'separate retrieval assimilation', separate soil moisture products are retrieved from each of the active and passive microwave observations, before being simultaneously assimilated into the model. in both approaches, a neural network (nn) is used to retrieve soil moisture from passive microwave amsr-e brightness temperatures and/or active microwave ascat backscatter observations. a spatially distributed (3d) ensemble kalman filter is used for the assimilation over the contiguous united states from august 2007 until september 2011. the analysis skill of both assimilation approaches is evaluated against in situ observations from 60 scan stations and compared to the model open loop (no assimilation) skill. when averaged across the 60 sites, the skill obtained from both assimilation experiments is very similar. for surface soil moisture, the average correlation and anomaly correlation are 0.69 and 0.58, respectively. these metrics are slightly better than those of the open loop, by 0.05 for the correlation and by 0.03 for the anomaly correlation. the root zone soil moisture estimates from the assimilation were also slightly improved compared to the open loop (by 0.03 for the average correlation and by 0.01 for the average anomaly correlation). locally, there are differences between the skill values of the two assimilation experiments. these are related to differences in the skill of the assimilated retrieval products and how well these differences are captured by the observation errors specified in the data assimilation.

rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting is an important technology in cities that can contribute to a number of functions, such as sustainable water management in the face of demand growth and drought as well as the detention of rainwater to increase flood protection and reduce damage to waterways. the objective of this article is to investigate the integrity of residential rainwater harvesting systems, drawing on the results of the field inspection of 417 rainwater systems across melbourne that was combined with a survey of householders' situation, maintenance behaviour and attitudes. specifically, the study moves beyond the assumption that rainwater systems are always operational and functional and draws on the collected data to explore the various reasons and rates of failure associated with pumps and pump switches, leaving for later further exploration of the failure in other components such as the collection area, gutters, tank, and overflows. to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no data like this in academic literature or in the water sector. straightforward bayesian network models were constructed in order to analyse the factors contributing to various types of failures, including system age, type of use, the reason for installation, installer, and maintenance behaviour. results show that a number of issues commonly exist, such as failure of pumps (5% of systems), automatic pump switches that mediate between the tank and reticulated water (9% of systems), and systems with inadequate setups (i.e. no pump) limiting their use. in conclusion, there appears to be a lack of enforcement or quality controls in both installation practices by sometimes unskilled contractors and lack of ongoing maintenance checks. mechanisms for quality control and asset management are required, but difficult to promote or enforce. further work is needed into how privately owned assets that have public benefits could be better managed. crown copyright (c) 2016 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
water_pollution	this paper is a part of a multi-disciplinary research ""application of decentralized on-site water treatment system in egypt for use in agriculture and producing safe fish and animal proteins"". the project aimed to investigate the environmental impact of implementing sewage water before and after treatment using the effluent of the on-site decentralized japanese' johkasou system, in agriculture and producing fish protein. the aim is to establish such system in egypt to strengthen the sanitary conditions of water resources. in the present study, the impact of the sewage pollution in some fish farms at el-fayyum, port said and el-dakahlia governorates in egypt was carried out. water and fish (oreochromis niloticus and mugil cephalus) samples were collected from private fish farms of such localities. bacteriological and chemical examination of water samples revealed the existence of coliforms and many other bacterial species of significant human health hazards. the chemical parameters of water showed a marked deviation from normal levels while examination of fish flesh specimens indicated contamination with streptococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., and salmonella in all examined localities. other bacterial isolates of human health importance (morganella morganii, pseudomonas cepacia and enterococcos durans) were identified. the parasitological examination revealed the presence of encysted metacercariae (emc); diplostomatidae, prohemistomatidae and heterphyidae. moreover, two protozoan parasites (mxyoboulus tilapiae and ichthyophthirius multifilis) were also recorded. the histopathological examination revealed mild tissue reaction in case of bacterial infection and severe pathological lesions in different organs in case of emc infection. lamellar hyperplasia and mononuclear cell infiltration in branchial tissue was common findings. in skeletal muscles, atrophy of muscle fibres, myolysis and myophagia were detected.

smart_material	water responsive sio2/cellulose nanocomposite hydrogels and films were constructed, for the first time, by dispersing sio2 nanoparticles into cellulose solution in lioh/urea solvent, and then by crosslinking with epichlorohydrin or regeneration in coagulation bath, respectively. the cellulose nanocomposite materials were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, ftir, dynamic rheology, wide angle x-ray diffraction and mechanical test. the sio2/cellulose nanocomposites at wet state or in water displayed unique behaviors, showing higher light transmittance than those before contacting with water. the results revealed that strong hydrogen-bonding interaction among water, cellulose and sio2 led the good dispersion of sio2 nanoparticles in the cellulose matrix. the incorporation of sio2 nanoparticles improved the transmittance and mechanical strength of the cellulose hydrogels, and also enhanced the mechanical strength of the films. especially, the cellulose/sio2 nanocomposite films were milky at dry state, and changed to transparent after being soaked in water, different from the cellulose film without the sio2 nanoparticles. in our findings, sio2 and cellulose with water could form strong hydrogen bonding to create a homogenous network structure. the cellulose/sio2 composite as a smart material exhibited moisture and solvent responsiveness, showing potential applications in moisture detection.
remote_sensing	volcanic ash cloud detection has been a difficult problem in moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) multispectral remote sensing application. principal component analysis (pca) and independent component analysis (ica) are effective feature extraction methods based on second-order and higher order statistical analysis, and the support vector machine (svm) can realize the nonlinear classification in low-dimensional space. based on the characteristics of modis multispectral remote sensing image, via presenting a new volcanic ash cloud detection method, named combined pca-ica-weighted and svm (cpiws), the current study tested the real volcanic ash cloud detection cases, i.e., sangeang api volcanic ash cloud of 30 may 2014. our experiments suggest that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the proposed cpiws method reach 87.20 and 0.7958%, respectively, under certain conditions with the suitable weighted values; this has certain feasibility and practical significance.
rainwater_harvesting	for the green village at the campus of delft university of technology, an autarkic water circuit was developed. the aim was to avoid connections to the public water supply system, the sewerage, the electricity grid and cable systems. it should produce its own drinking water and electricity, and clean its organic waste streams in a sustainable way. due to the strict dutch drinking water regulations, only one water quality will be supplied: drinking water. drinking water will be produced from greywater (53%) supplemented with rainwater (47%). in the treatment scheme, the multiple barrier approach will be used to comply with the dutch drinking water quality standards. for greywater treatment, a triple barrier is suggested: ozonation - ultrafiltration - uv disinfection. for rainwater treatment a dual barrier is suggested: ultrafiltration - uv disinfection. by separating wastewater streams at the point of origin into greywater and blackwater, and by replacing conventional toilets with low water consumption vacuum systems as part of the water conservation measures, it will be possible to collect a concentrated blackwater stream suitable for recovery energy. for this purpose the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor is suggested. the proposed water circuit results in an autarkic water management, but not in an autarkic energy management.

green_building	the development of technology, people have a huge demand for smart homes. in recent years, a variety of smart home designs cannot be satisfied with satisfy people. the new technology used in construction, which was called smart homes. smart home offers many architectural features which are more suitable for human life situations, such as the smart of life, family care, home security, and green building. conventional smart home has focused on developing embedded devices. but it cannot meet the needs of today 's human-machine interface of smarter home. therefore, in this paper we propose an intelligent management model based on cbr-sda approach. the smart-life recommendation system is proposed in this paper, which it is an example for choosing clothes and accessories. finally, the smart home features by using the intelligent management model based on cbr-sda approach in order to improve the users' experiences will be further various contributions.
solar_energy	in this paper, the potential of solar and wind energy-based distributed generation (dg) in saudi arabia is simultaneously analyzed with the aim of maximizing the utilization of available resources. it begins with an analysis of dg application potential for wind and solar energy resources in various regions of saudi arabia. the progress of dg applications in terms of research, planning, and exploitation of wind and solar energy resources is then presented. an assessment of the dg contribution to the energy sector of saudi arabia has been conducted and the barriers and challenges for the implementation of dg systems in the country are discussed with suggested measures to overcome the challenges. the main findings are that with the huge potential of wind and solar resources for dg applications the country has targeted 50 gw of wind and solar capacity by the year 2040. the saudi government is expected to provide full support in the form of financial incentives for solar and wind energy projects in order to boost renewable energy development.
rainwater_harvesting	this research investigated the relevance of four hydrological variables in the performance of a domestic rainwater harvesting (drwh) system. the hydrological variables investigated are average annual rainfall (p), precipitation concentration degree (pcd), antecedent dry weather period (adwp), and ratio of dry days to rainy days (n(d)/n(r)). principal component analyses are used to group the water-saving efficiency into a select set of variables, and the relevance of the hydrological variables in a water-saving efficiency system was studied using canonical correlation analysis. the p associated with pcd, adwp, or nd/nr attained a better correlation with water-saving efficiency than single p. we conclude that empirical models that represent a large combinations of roof-surface areas, rainwater-tank sizes, water demands, and rainfall regimes should also consider a variable for precipitation temporal variability, and treat it as an independent variable.

geotextile	a test cover comprised of three different needle-punched geosynthetic clay liner (gcl) products and covered with up to 1 m of cover soil (gravelly sand) was built over arsenic-rich tailings at a former gold mine in nova scotia, canada, to evaluate the performance of the gcls under local climatic conditions. of the gcls examined, one had untreated and two had polymer-enhanced natural sodium bentonite. the three gcls each had different carriers: one with a woven geotextile, one with a scrim-reinforced nonwoven geotextile, and one with a woven geotextile laminated with a polypropylene film. at some locations, each type of gcl was placed in direct contact with the tailings. at other locations, each gcl was separated from the tailings by 0.15 m of cover soil. samples of each gcl, tailings, and cover soil were recovered 1 and 2 years after construction. tests show that the gcl with untreated bentonite maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (= 0.7 m of cover soil above the gcl even though there was significant cation exchange of the sodium in the gcl with divalent cations in the tailings-soil porewater (the mole fraction of sodium (exchangeable sodium percentage (esp)) decreased from 65% to 10%-17%). the gcl with polymer-enhanced bentonite had a lower hydraulic conductivity (= 0.7 m of cover soil above the gcl) and experienced less cation exchange (esp decreased to 19%-28%) than the standard gcl. the other gcl with polymer-enhanced bentonite and a carrier geotextile coated with a geofilm demonstrated the best hydraulic performance regardless of the thickness of cover soil or presence of an initially uncontaminated foundation layer. the presence of a foundation layer between the gcl and tailings impeded the migration of arsenic from the tailings into the gcls. all gcls were serving as an effective barrier to arsenic migration.
ambient_intelligence	situation awareness is a computing paradigm which allows applications to sense parameters in the environment, comprehend their meaning and project their status in the next future. in collaborative situation awareness, a challenging area in the field of ambient intelligence applications, situation patterns emerge from users' collective behavior. in this paper we introduce a multi-agent system that exploits positioning information coming from mobile devices to detect the occurrence of user 's situations related to social events. in the functional view of the system, the first level of information processing is managed by marking agents which leave marks in the environment in correspondence to the users' positions. the accumulation of marks enables a stigmergic cooperation mechanism, generating short-term memory structures in the local environment. information provided by such structures is granulated by event agents which associate a certainty degree with each event. finally, an inference level, managed by situation agents, deduces user situations from the underlying events by exploiting fuzzy rules whose parameters are generated automatically by a neuro-fuzzy approach. fuzziness allows the system to cope with the uncertainty of the events. in the architectural view of the system, we adopt semantic web standards to guarantee structural interoperability in an open application environment. the system has been tested on different real-world scenarios to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

rainwater_harvesting	this study was aimed at developing an optimization approach to rainwater harvesting (rwh) considering three (3) water consumption scenarios (wcs). these scenarios which include basic water need (bwn), pour flush (pf) and full plumbing connection (fpc) corresponding to 50 litres per capita per day (lpcd), 75(lpcd) and 150(lpcd) respectively were simulated for different categories of buildings. reliability of supply was determined by first obtaining composite surplus/deficit of rainwater followed by optimizing the redistribution of surplus rainwater harvested to deficient buildings. results showed that when total annual rainfall intercepted by roof exceeded total demand, 100% reliability of water supply was guaranteed. reliability was found to be a linear function of storage. when reliability of supply is possible, the optimized storage bears an inverse exponential relationship to the roof plan area per capita. the relationship between surplus/deficit and roof plan area per capita follows a one-phase decay pattern. an optimal redistribution of surplus water from self-sufficient buildings to deficient ones gave an improvement in supply reliability from 64 to 87% for basic water need, 47 to 58% for pour flush and 28 to 29% for full plumbing connection.
remote_sensing	soil moisture distributions with high spatio-temporal resolution are scarce but beneficial for understanding ecohydrological processes and closing the water cycle at the basin scale. sensor networks are innovative in their ability to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and dynamics of soil moisture; however, they cannot be used to directly derive spatially continuous soil moisture distributions. a bayesian-based upscaling algorithm that utilizes modis-derived apparent thermal inertia is used to map daily soil moisture spatial patterns with a resolution of 1 km in the babao river basin, china. the 2-4 cm soil moisture observations from seven automatic meteorological stations located in different elevation zones from 3000 m to 3500 m are employed to validate the mapping algorithm. the correlation coefficient and unbiased root-mean-square error (rmse) averaged 0.880 and 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, which indicate satisfactory estimation accuracy. the 1 km resolution soil moisture products are re-sampled to a resolution of 25 km and then compared to the level 3 soil moisture and ocean salinity mission (smos) soil moisture product. the results show that both products exhibit strong temporal consistency; however, due to complex topography, the smos soil moisture is generally lower than that of the upscaling results. semivariograms and an empirical orthogonal function (eof) analysis are used to analyze the space-time heterogeneities of soil moisture at the 1 km scale. in the summer, rainfall results in soil moisture with low spatial variability and a complex spatial structure. after the rainy season, the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is affected by other factors, such as soil texture, evapotranspiration and topography. from the perspective of temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from august to october. because more rain falls in the summer due to the mountain microclimate, the oscillation in soil moisture is more pronounced over 20% of the area compared to that in other regions. based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products.

rainwater_harvesting	knowing water consumption patterns in buildings is key information for water planning. this article aims to characterize the water consumption pattern and water end-uses in low-income houses in the region of florianopolis, southern brazil. data were collected by interviewing householders, as well as by measuring the flow rate of existing water fixtures and appliances. the results indicated that the shower was the fixture with the largest water consumption in households, i.e., about 30%-36% of total water consumption on average, followed by the toilet (18%-20%). the surveyed households consumed from 111 to 152 l/capita day on average, based on different income ranges. no correlation was found between income and water consumption. the results of this study can be used to estimate the consumption of water for new buildings, as well as to develop integrated water management strategies in low-income developments, in florianopolis, such as water-saving plumbing fixtures, rainwater harvesting, and greywater reuse. likely, there would be a deferral of capital investments in new water assets for enhancing water and wastewater services by saving water in low-income houses.
remote_sensing	china had implemented the national strategies for major function-oriented zones (mfozs) to realize the goal of national sustainable development since 2010. this study analyzed and compared spatio-temporal characteristics and differences in built-up area for china 's mfozs using a china' s land use database (clud) derived from high-resolution remotely sensed images in the periods of 2000-2010 and 2010-2013. to sum up: (1) the percentage of built-up area in each of the mfozs was significantly different, revealing the gradient feature of national land development based on the distribution of the main functions. (2) annual growth in built-up area in optimal development zones (odzs) decreased significantly during 2010-2013 compared with the period 2000-2010, while annual growth in built-up area in key development zones (kdzs), agricultural production zones (apzs) and key ecological function zones (kefzs) increased significantly. (3) in odzs, the average annual increase in built-up area in the yangtze river delta region was significantly higher than in other regions; the average area increase and rate of increase of built-up area in kdzs was faster in the western region than in other regions; average annual area growth of built-up area in apzs in the northeast, central and western regions was twice as high as the previous decade on average; the annual rate of change and increase in the dynamic degree of built-up area were most notable in kefzs in the central region. (4) the spatial pattern and characteristics of built-up area expansions in the period 2010-2013 reflected the gradient feature of the plan for mfozs. but the rate of increase locally in built-up area in odzs, apzs and kefzs is fast, so the effective measures must be adopted in the implementation of national and regional policies. the conclusions indicated these methods and results were meaningful for future regulation strategies in optimizing national land development in china.
rainwater_harvesting	majority of the population is dependent on the conventional energy sources for their day today needs. leading edge research on the renewable sources of energy is on a rise in order to meet the increasing energy demand without straining the environment. the objective of this project is to harvest potential energy inherent in tall buildings because of the high altitudes using micro-pelton turbine at the ground from grey water and rain water. purified grey water is collected in a tank placed at the centre of the building and rain water collection tank is placed at the top of the building. a control system is designed for optimum power output from the turbine and to monitor the levels of water. separation and storage of used rainwater in a tank is also controlled. the pelton turbine is designed and further analyzed in ansys - fluent, computationally for the power output. when number of high rises is escalating and awareness about rainwater harvesting and renewable sources of energy is indispensable, this source of energy will turn out to be viable option.
suspension_bridge	this study presents a system based on passively controlled leading- and trailing-edge flaps that is designed to suppress wind-induced instabilities such as flutter and torsional divergence. the utility of the approach is demonstrated on a three-dimensional bridge model. particular emphasis is placed on the early stages of the deck erection process when the bridge is particularly vulnerable to flutter. the flaps are activated by the deck 's movements though passive phase-compensating mechanisms comprising of springs, dampers and inerters. it is demonstrated that optimised compensator parameters, and optimum hinge locations, result in a substantially improved deck aerodynamic performance. particular importance is given to ensuring that the controlled system has good closed-loop 'robustness' properties, or in other words, that the controlled system has a high tolerance to parameter variations and uncertainties in the system dynamics. the practical use of a nonlinear optimisation algorithm with a fe bridge aeroelastic model, which includes the flap dynamics, necessitates the use of reduced-order models. a novel model reduction procedure that is based on the retention of dominant poles is introduced into the aeroelastic modelling framework. multimodal interactions are observed at the various erection stages and conclusions are drawn with regard to the contributions of various modes of vibration to aeroelastic instabilities. the main advantage of this approach lies on the passive system 's simplicity and its ability to simultaneously increase the flutter and torsional divergence boundaries. the humber bridge in the u.k. is chosen as a study example for numerical simulations.

water_pollution	a multidisciplinary research project series has sought to identify and better understand multiple hygienic-microbiological and chemical contaminations from both point sources and diffuse pollution to contribute to the improvement in surface water quality. in the catchment area of the river swist (germany), municipal sewage treatment plants were investigated, followed by event-based investigation of combined sewer overflows, rainwater retention basins and diffuse pollution by surface and subsurface run-off as well as drain pipes. recently, retention soil filters installed between stormwater storage basins and receiving surface waters in order to provide further treatment of combined sewer overflows were investigated. geographical information system analysis helped to examine the data in their temporal and spatial dimensions. a model for calculating microbial and chemical loads within a catchment area was developed (""swistbox"") which provides an efficient tool for risk assessment. nearly two decades of investigation has demonstrated that several elements of the landscape 's water balance account for surface water pollution from both diffuse and point sources. depending on land cover characteristics, wastewater technology and the proportion of wastewater as compared to total river water flow, a source can vary in its importance for the catchment area. the findings can be applied for sustainable and health-sensitive catchment management in relation to recreational or agricultural water use as well as ecological aspects.
water_pollution	in many areas of the world, leaching of phosphorus in the soil causes serious water pollution. the purpose of this research was to decrease the phosphorus loss in soil by the adsorption behavior of biochars with special structural characteristics. in this study, a series of analysis methods including scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, elemental composition, thermogravimetric, and x-ray diffractometer analysis have been used to investigate the properties and structures of different sources of biochars. the adsorption of phosphorus by maize-straw biochar, rice-hull biochar, and pine biochar was quantified by the balance method in this research. the results show that pine biochar has more structural and thermal stability than maize-straw biochar and rice-hull biochar. different sources of biochar have significantly different phosphate adsorption capabilities. pine biochar has the best phosphorus adsorption capacity; the actual maximum adsorption capacity was 13.898mgg(-1); however, the phosphorus adsorption capacity of maize-straw biochar was minimum, the actual maximum adsorption capacity was 8.809mgg(-1). the volume of phosphorus adsorption on biochars increases with increasing concentration of phosphorus added to the solution, but the rate of increase gradually decreases. the phosphorus adsorption curve agreed well with the langmuir isotherm equation.
water_pollution	rare earth ions (reis) are playing very important roles in modern industries. however, the huge amount of smelting water containing various types of reis was difficult to separate, which often lead to difficulty in recovery of reis and water pollution in environment. selective adsorption was an effective route to recover the reis in smelting water. two adsorbents (sio2-bt, sio2-bwt) were prepared by grafting plant tannins (bayberry tannin, black wattle tannin) onto aminated silica. the as-prepared adsorbents have exhibited a high adsorption capacity to four typical reis and high selectivity to la3+ among these four reis (la3+, ce3+, pr3+, nd3+). furthermore, the after-used adsorbents can be easily regenerated by 0.1mol/l hno3 solution indicating superior reusability.
suspension_bridge	the dimensional field testing activity described in this paper allowed measuring the vertical and transverse dynamic displacement related to the main span (with a dimension equal to 1012 meters) central section of a long-span suspension bridge the 25th of april bridge (p25a), in lisbon (portugal) using an optical system composed by high focal length lens (600 mm), digital image sensor and active infrared led targets. maximum values of 0,53 m and 0,29 m were obtained for the vertical and transverse displacements without rail traffic on the p25a. passenger train circulation on the bridge 's lower rail deck increased the vertical displacement up to 1,69 m. the applied measuring system was subjected to an in situ calibration procedure (si traceable), showing maximum deviations close to 1,3 mm with an expanded measurement uncertainty (in a 95% confidence interval) around 3,0 mm, in a favorable observation scenario (winter season with low vertical thermal gradient in the atmosphere). field studies of optical phenomena such as atmospheric refraction and beam wandering effect by turbulence were also performed, aiming the validation of developed refraction correction models and the quantification of targets image coordinates dispersions (0,13 pixel in winter season a 0,56 pixel during summer season).
green_building	sustainable design practices are a key component in ensuring that the building and civil infrastructure industry does not damage our natural environment. green buildings and allied initiatives in other sectors of the built environment are a primary mover in promoting sustainable design practices. an important and dangerous inhibitor of sustainable design practices, however, is the perception among key decision-makers that the additional costs of green or sustainably designed buildings are too high, and that they are therefore not economically viable. this study tested what those perceptions are, and compared the results to (limited) actual cost data and found that the cost premium is less than half of what most decision-makers think it is. recommendations are then made around the development of- awareness programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, the need to highlight the necessity for developing further and more accurate data related to green building costs, and the need to establish incentives to drive the take-up of sustainable design practices.
solar_energy	the optical and dielectric properties of copper oxide (cuo) have made it a fascinating material to be used in solar energy harvesting, gas sensing, optoelectronics and catalytical applications. focusing on the cost= effectiveness of sol-gel method, it is employed for nanostructured cuo production. effect of changing temperature is observed on the formation mechanism of cuo and its properties. the temperature range of 300 degrees c-500 degrees c was used in annealing of samples to produce defect free cuo nanomaterial. prepared material was investigated using phase characterization (x-ray diffraction 'xrd') technique, scanning electron microscopy (sem), uv visible absorption spectroscopy and lcr meter. a structural change in prepared cuo was observed from, cluster formation to nano-fibrils by increase in annealing temperature. 11.99 nm-29.17 nm crystallites of cuo were attained by using debye scherer formula. a large band gap of 3.15 ev was achieved by increasing the annealing temperature upto 400 degrees c. for better solar energy harvest, wide band gapped cuo structures are proved to be functional and practical materials. the fabricated cuo nanostructures were found suitable to be used in devices for stabilizing circuit designs for sensitive appliances as well as micro electromechanical systems (mems).

geotextile	this study evaluates the long-term performance of two types of geotextiles that were used for 18 years in drainage trenches to stabilize slopes in the french alps. the flow rate analysis of each trench enabled estimating an average permittivity at trench scale of between 10(-5) and 10(-6) s(-1). after exhuming the geotextiles, their hydraulic and mechanical properties were assessed. the hydraulic tests performed on geotextiles alone gave permittivities greater than 10(-3) s(-1). gradient ratio tests were performed on undisturbed soil/geotextile/drainage specimens and gave results in the order of 10(-8) s(-1). the aged specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy. quantifying the overall performance of the geotextile filter is complicated because of the brittleness of the calcite crust and the subsequent difficulty of characterizing undisturbed interfaces. various possible explanatory mechanisms involved in the deterioration of trench performance were reviewed: filter cake blinding, internal clogging and downstream chemical clogging. existing analytical models were used in order to predict the loss of hydraulic performance due to each of these clogging mechanisms. by comparing the measured permittivities to the calculated permittivities, we demonstrated that chemical clogging due to calcite precipitation on the downstream face of the geotextiles was probably the preponderant mechanism responsible for the poorer performance of geotextile filters at trench scale.

geotextile	during microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (micp), the cementation medium needs to fully contact and react with bacteria inside a soil sample through pores of sand. the goal of this study was to develop a new sample preparation mold, i.e., a full-contact flexible mold, to prepare samples during the micp process. the mold was constructed using a needle-punched, nonwoven geotextile material. specimens of different sizes were prepared using the full-contact flexible mold to evaluate the engineering soil properties improved by the micp process. the results indicated that the mechanical improvement of the micp-treated soil using the full-contact flexible mold is one order of magnitude higher than that of the typical sample preparation method. the full-contact flexible mold enhances the contact between the bacteria and the cementation medium and promotes homogeneous calcium carbonate precipitation within the sand pores.
green_building	while the paradigm of sustainable development has largely influenced architecture projects worldwide, green building certifications (gbcs) have become the new (increasingly mandatory) standard of project performance. numerous studies have concentrated on the influence of sustainable development (sd) in the final product: the building. however, more research is still needed in order to understand how gbcs have influenced building processes, particularly collaboration and innovation within architecture projects. in order to fill this gap, this study presents results from 19 interviews with professionals in the built environment and examines three architecture projects conducted in canada that received a widely popular gbc and were significantly influenced by sd principles during the design and building process. the research applies recent frameworks for exploring stakeholders' interests on gbcs and the collaboration and innovation practices developed by them. research results show that processes within these projects are shaped by at least four tensions that can either enhance or hinder collaboration and innovation: strategic-tactical, collaborative-competitive, participative-effective and individual-collective. the study highlights the importance of understanding gbc as a process and not only as a final outcome, and thus, to better manage these tensions so that they contribute to product and process performance.
solar_energy	background: ethanol photosynthetic production based on cyanobacteria cell factories utilizing co2 and solar energy provides an attractive solution for sustainable production of green fuels. however, the scaling up processes of cyanobacteria cell factories were usually threatened or even devastated by biocontaminations, which restricted biomass or products accumulations of cyanobacteria cells. thus it is of great significance to develop reliable bio-contamination- controlling strategies for promoting ethanol photosynthetic production in large scales. results: the scaling up process of a previously developed synechocystis strain syn-hz24 for ethanol synthesis was severely inhibited and devastated by a specific contaminant, pannonibacter phragmitetus, which overcame the growths of cyanobacteria cells and completely consumed the ethanol accumulation in the cultivation systems. physiological analysis revealed that growths and ethanol-consuming activities of the contaminant were sensitive to alkaline conditions, while ethanol-synthesizing cyanobacteria strain syn-hz24 could tolerate alkaline ph conditions as high as 11.0, indicating that ph-increasing strategy might be a feasible approach for rescuing ethanol photosynthetic production in outdoor cultivation systems. thus, we designed and evaluated a bicarbonate-based integrated carbon capture system (biccs) derived ph-rising strategy to rescue the ethanol photosynthetic production in non-sterilized conditions. in lab scale artificially simulated systems, ph values of bg11 culture medium were maintained around 11.0 by 180 mm nahco3 and air steam, under which the infection of pannonibacter phragmitetus was significantly restricted, recovering ethanol production of syn-hz24 by about 80%. as for outdoor cultivations, ethanol photosynthetic production of syn-hz24 was also successfully rescued by the biccs-derived ph-rising strategy, obtaining a final ethanol concentration of 0.9 g/l after 10 days cultivation. conclusions: in this work, a novel product-consuming biocontamination pattern in cyanobacteria cultivations, causing devastated ethanol photosynthetic production, was identified and characterized. physiological analysis of the essential ethanol-consuming contaminant directed the design and application of a ph-rising strategy, which effectively and selectively controlled the contamination and rescued ethanol photosynthetic production. our work demonstrated the importance of reliable contamination control systems and strategies for large scale outdoor cultivations of cyanobacteria, and provided an inspiring paradigm for targeting effective solutions.
rainwater_harvesting	population growth, urbanization, pollution, and climate change pose urgent water challenges in cities. in this study, the sustainability of integrated water resources management in ho chi minh city (hcmc) was evaluated using the city blueprint approach. the city blueprint is a set of 24 dedicated indicators divided over 8 categories (i.e., water security, water quality, drinking water, sanitation, infrastructure, climate robustness, biodiversity and attractiveness, and governance including public participation). the analysis showed that the rapid increase of water use for urban, industrial, and agricultural activities in hcmc has resulted in depletion of groundwater and severe pollution of both groundwater and surface water. surface water quality, groundwater quality, biodiversity, and the sanitation of domestic and industrial wastewater are matters that need serious improvement. current and future water supply in hcmc is at risk. hcmc can cope with it, but the 7 governance gaps as described by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) are major obstacles for hcmc. rainwater harvesting, pollution reduction, as well as wastewater reuse are among the practical options. wastewater reuse could lower the water stress index to 10%. the window to do this is narrow and rapidly closing as a result of the unprecedented urbanization and economic growth of this region. integr environ assess manag 2016;12:345-352.

construction_management	based on the cellular automata model, a meticulous two-lane cellular automata model is proposed, in which the driving behavior difference and the difference of vehicles' accelerations between the moving state and the starting state are taken into account. furthermore the vehicles' motion is refined by using the small cell of one meter long. then accompanied by coming up with a traffic management measure, a two-lane highway traffic model containing a work zone is presented, in which the road is divided into normal area, merging area and work zone. the vehicles in different areas move forward according to different lane changing rules and position updating rules. after simulation it is found that when the density is small the cluster length in front of the work zone increases with the decrease of the merging probability. then the suitable merging length and the appropriate speed limit value are recommended. the simulation result in the form of the speed-flow diagram is in good agreement with the empirical data. it indicates that the presented model is efficient and can partially reflect the real traffic. the results may be meaningful for traffic optimization and road construction management.

construction_management	construction is one of the most hazardous industries. this study analyzes occupational risk and focuses specifically on the question of perception of risk based on a sample of construction workers from three countries (spain, peru, and nicaragua) that, in spite of sharing the same language (spanish), have different socioeconomic levels. the model used for this study is based on the psychometric paradigm. the results of the survey using a questionnaire indicate that the sample population can be separated into two different clusters, each characterized either by a high or a low perception of risk. the authors then attempted to establish a link between the level of perceived risk and different socio-demographic variables. the outcome is that only the training variable significantly altered the perception of risk. this finding, as well as various other aspects of risk perception from the different nations, are discussed. the conclusions of this study provide interesting guidelines for risk management for the construction industry, such as, for example, the increase of the number of hours of worker safety and health training or that the nationality the workers does not appear to affect worker risk perception.
water_pollution	four bench-scale solar photocatalytic reactors were fabricated viz. solar photocatalytic single-baffle reactor (spsbr), solar photocatalytic multiple-baffles reactor (spmbr), solar photocatalytic cascade reactor (spcr) and solar photocatalytic pond reactor (sppr) of 5-l capacity. evaluation of the reactors performance was carried out by varying the volume of wastewaters in the range of 1-5 l and the recycle flow rates in the range of 250-750 ml/min for the degradation of phenolic wastewaters. the single-baffle reactor gives the maximum phenol removal efficiency irrespective of all volume of wastewater. the phenol removal efficiency increases when the recycle flow rate is increased from 250 to 500 ml/min and then decreased for the recycle flow rate of 750 ml/min. the single-baffle reactor showed the maximum phenol removal efficiency with recycle flow rate of 500 ml/min. for untreated pulp and paper mill wastewater of 200 mg/l phenol concentration, the bod5/cod ratio is 0.02, while solar photocatalytic treatment of 4 h enhanced the biodegradability values to 0.80.
solar_energy	a new process based on thermal-hydraulic conversion actuated by low-grade thermal energy is investigated. input thermal energy can be provided by the means of solar collectors, as well as other low temperature energy sources. in the following article, ""thermo-hydraulic"" term refers to a process involving an incompressible fluid used as an intermediate medium to transfer work hydraulically between different thermal operated components or sub-systems. the system aims at providing trigeneration energy features for the residential sector, that is providing heating, cooling and electrical power for meeting the energy needs of domestic houses. this innovative system is made of two dithermal processes (working at two different levels of temperatures) and featuring two different working fluids. the first process is able to directly supply either electrical energy generated by an hydraulic turbine or drives the second process thanks to the incompressible fluid, which is similar to a heat pump effect for heating or cooling purposes. the innovative aspect of this process relies on the use of an hydraulic transfer fluid to transfer the work between each sub-system and therefore simplifying the conversion chain. a model, assuming steady-state operation, is developed to assess the energy performances of different variants of this thermo-hydraulic process with various heat source temperatures (80-110 degrees c) or heat sinks (0-30 degrees c), as well as various pairs of working fluids. for instance, in the frame of a single-family home, located in the mediterranean region, the working fluid pairs (r1234yf/r1233zd) is investigated in detail in order to estimate the annual performances. for domestic houses, the process aims at amplifying the solar energy collected by a factor of 1.32 for heating purpose, provides a cold production with a coefficient of performance of 0.4 and generates electricity from the remaining solar energy with an efficiency of 3.7%, reducing the electrical or auxiliary consumption and overall greenhouse gas emissions.

rainwater_harvesting	here we have developed a new model to simulate supplemental irrigation and the hydro-economic potential of a rainwater harvesting system in rainfed agricultural areas. using the model, soil moisture in rainfed crop land, supplemental irrigation requirements, rainwater storage in an on-farm reservoir (ofr) system, and surface and ground water availability were predicted. in an irrigated system, an ofr was used to harvest rainwater during the rainy season, and stored water was applied to cropland as supplemental irrigation (si). an economic analysis was performed to calculate the benefits due to an ofr irrigation system, and gains from increased crop yield and downstream water availability in the irrigated ofr system were compared with rainfed system (i.e. no ofr). in addition, we calculated the impacts of dry and wet seasons on total value gains (grain and water gains) for irrigated and rainfed conditions and performed a sensitivity analysis to quantify the impacts of model input parameters on total value gains. analyses showed that the ofr system can produce crop yields three times greater than rainfed agriculture. during a water stress season, the total water use in the irrigated system was 65 % greater than for the rainfed system. water use efficiency of the irrigated system was 82 % higher than for the rainfed system. in a dry season, the total value gains due to increased crop yield by supplemental irrigation and downstream water availability of the irrigated system were 74 % greater than for the rainfed system, while in a wet season the total value gain of the irrigated system was 14 % greater than for the rainfed system. a precipitation scenario analysis of wet and dry seasons indicated that the benefits of a rainwater harvesting system can be considerably greater in dry seasons than wet seasons.
suspension_bridge	the presence of traffic on a slender long-span bridge deck will modify the cross-section profile of the bridge, which may influence the flutter derivatives and in turn, the critical flutter wind velocity of the bridge. studies on the influence of vehicles on the flutter derivatives and the critical flutter wind velocity of bridges are rather rare as compared to the investigations on the coupled buffeting vibration of the wind-vehicle-bridge system. a typical streamlined cross-section for long-span bridges is adopted for both experimental and analytical studies. the scaled bridge section model with vehicle models distributed on the bridge deck considering different traffic flow scenarios has been tested in the wind tunnel. the flutter derivatives of the modified bridge cross section have been identified using forced vibration method and the results suggest that the influence of vehicles on the flutter derivatives of the typical streamlined cross-section cannot be ignored. based on the identified flutter derivatives, the influence of vehicles on the flutter stability of the bridge is investigated. the results show that the effect of vehicles on the flutter wind velocity is obvious.
construction_management	to meet clients' and owners' multidimensional and changing requirements, construction management consultants (cmcs) ought to possess a diverse and dynamic knowledge structure. in china, although the population of cmcs has grown to the point of their being indispensable in the industry, their knowledge structure has not been explored explicitly. the study presented in this paper investigated this by first conducting a comprehensive content analysis of the curricula of the highest ranked construction management university courses in china. this was followed by in-depth interviews with experts, resulting in the identification of 22 main knowledge areas that can be grouped into technology, economy, management, and law. a questionnaire survey was then conducted among 115 experienced cmcs to evaluate the current level of knowledge in these areas together with their importance and need for improvement. the main findings demonstrate the significance of the identified 22 knowledge areas, and they also need substantial improvement in practice. the research has practical implications for china 's cmcs to develop necessary knowledge and the extent to which they need to be improved to provide a better quality of services in the future.
solar_energy	light-initiated generation of energetic carriers has attracted considerable attention as a paradigm for photocatalysis and solar energy conversion, and the use of noble metal nanoparticles that support localized surface plasmon resonances has been widely explored as a medium for realizing this paradigm. it was recently shown that composite nanostructures enabling the interplay between dielectric scattering resonances and broadband absorption in small metal nanostructures, a phenomenon termed scattering mediated absorption, can be used to mediate energetic carrier transfer and selective photochemistry with low-intensity light while completely circumventing plasmon resonance. in this work, we develop a multiscale modeling approach for elucidating the hot carrier dynamics initiated by scattering-mediated absorption. our calculations reveal that unique hot carrier distributions and dynamics arise from scattering-mediated absorption as compared to plasmon excitation and also suggest that in a variety of circumstances scattering-mediated absorption may lead to more efficient hot carrier generation compared to plasmon resonance under the same external illumination conditions. these results are an important first step in understanding the phenomena of scattering-mediated hot carrier generation, which has potential for expanding the palette of materials that can be utilized for hot carrier mediated photochemistry beyond plasmonic metals and for enabling unique pathways for photocatalytic transformations.

green_building	buildings of commercial and non commercial purpose consume large amount of electricity. therefore to design a green or smart city the biggest challenge for a designer is to convert all buildings from energy consumer to energy producer. recent study reveals that most of the designer prefer solar energy for smart city development because it can be housed in a limited space and is characterized as pollution free, environment friendly, sustainable as well as noise-free source of electricity. among the photovoltaic technologies rooftop and building integrated photovoltaic (bipv) technology are the commonly adopted technologies for green building. this paper presents a comparative study of cost-benefit analysis between roof top solar and bipv technology for making a green campus of university of engineering and management, kolkata, phase 1. the result of the study will help designer to select proper photovoltaic technology to develop a green city in more cost effective way.
water_pollution	despite the increasing levels of pollution in many tropical african countries, not much is known about the strength and weaknesses of policy and institutional frameworks to tackle pollution and ecological status of rivers and their impacts on the biota. we investigated the ecological status of four large river basins using physicochemical water quality parameters and bioindicators by collecting samples from forest, agriculture, and urban landscapes of the nile, omo-gibe, tekeze, and awash river basins in ethiopia. we also assessed the water policy scenario to evaluate its appropriateness to prevent and control pollution. to investigate the level of understanding and implementation of regulatory frameworks and policies related to water resources, we reviewed the policy documents and conducted in-depth interviews of the stakeholders. physicochemical and biological data revealed that there is significant water quality deterioration at the impacted sites (agriculture, coffee processing, and urban landscapes) compared to reference sites (forested landscapes) in all four basins. the analysis of legal, policy, and institutional framework showed a lack of cooperation between stakeholders, lack of knowledge of the policy documents, absence of enforcement strategies, unavailability of appropriate working guidelines, and disconnected institutional setup at the grass root level to implement the set strategies as the major problems. in conclusion, river water pollution is a growing challenge and needs urgent action to implement intersectoral collaboration for water resource management that will eventually lead toward integrated watershed management. revision of policy and increasing the awareness and participation of implementers are vital to improve ecological quality of rivers.
ambient_intelligence	agents and agent systems are becoming more and more important in the development of a variety of fields such as ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, autonomous computing, intelligent systems and intelligent robotics. in this paper, we analyze how agent technology is presented in mathematical models of computation demonstrating how these models are used in the novel distributed intelligent managed element (dime) network architecture (dna), which extends the conventional computational model of information processing networks, allowing improvement of the efficiency and resiliency of computational processes.
ambient_intelligence	the smart home, ambient intelligence and ambient assisted living have been intensively researched for decades. although rural areas are an important potential market, because they represent about 80% of the territory of the eu countries and around 125 million inhabitants, there is currently a lack of applicable aal solutions. this paper discusses the theoretical foundations of aal in rural areas. this discussion is underlined by the achievements of the empirical field study, casa vecchia, which has been carried out over a four-year period in a rural area in austria. the major goal of casa vecchia was to evaluate the feasibility of a specific form of aal for rural areas: bringing aal technology to the homes of the elderly, rather than moving seniors to special-equipped care facilities. the casa vecchia project thoroughly investigated the possibilities, challenges and drawbacks of aal related to this specific approach. the findings are promising and somewhat surprising and indicate that further technical, interactional and socio-psychological research is required to make aal in rural areas reasonable in the future.
solar_energy	silicon-glass devices are widely used in ic industry, mems and solar energy system because of their reliability and simplicity of the manufacturing process. with the trend toward the wafer level chip scale package (wlcsp) technology, the suitable dicing method of silicon-glass bonded structure wafer has become necessary. in this paper, a combined experimental and computational approach is undertaken to investigate the feasibility of cutting the sandwich structure glass-silicon-glass (sgs) wafer with laser induced thermal-crack propagation (litp) method. a 1064 nm semiconductor laser cutting system with double laser beams which could simultaneously irradiate on the top and bottom of the sandwich structure wafer has been designed. a mathematical model for describing the physical process of the interaction between laser and sgs wafer, which consists of two surface heating sources and two volumetric heating sources, has been established. the temperature stress distribution are simulated by using finite element method (fem) analysis software abaqus. the crack propagation process is analyzed by using the j-integral method. in the fem model, a stationary planar crack is embedded in the wafer and the j-integral values around the crack front edge are determined using the fem. a verification experiment under typical parameters is conducted and the crack propagation profile on the fracture surface is examined by the optical microscope and explained from the stress distribution and j-integral value.

construction_management	huaihe river sea-entering channel is a strategic backbone project, which expands the huaihe river flood way out, improves the hongze lake flood control standard, ensures the safety of 20 x 10(7) people and 30 x 10(7) mu arable land. environmental impact assessment system is carried out in engineering construction, and the ""three simultaneous"" management system - simultaneous design, construction, and use, is taken for environmental protection. optimal scheme is confirmed in the early planning stage; in the construction stage, environmental protection problems are managed strictly by construction. management department, construction units and supervising unit; in trial operation phase, levee and beach farmland ecological environment have been restored and soil conservation measures are implemented; land utilization is controlled strictly by using non-cultivated land and accounting for less fertile farmland during the resettlement. 4. 117 x 10(9) yuan has been invested recently in huaihe river sea-entering channel project, and 2. 17 x 10(8) yuan, accounting for 5.4% of the total investment, is invested in environmental protection. the project passed the water acceptance and was put into use in may of 2003. in 2006 it passed the final acceptance of construction. the project has discharged 7.7 x 10(8) m(3) during the experience of two huaihe river flood in 2003 and 2007, which plays a key role in valley security and regional development. the project with a novel architectural style, a beautiful environment and convenient transportation is becoming a water conservancy tourism projects consisted of engineering landscape, natural scenery, garden art, popular science training and entertainment, according to the purpose of green water conservancy and ecological water conservancy during the construction and operation management.
solar_energy	this paper presents a detailed cost analysis of a small-scale concentrated solar power (csp) generator based on parabolic dish collectors and micro gas turbines (mgt), whose technical feasibility was already demonstrated in previous publications by the consortium. the system can be used for either electric power or combined heat and power generation, whether operating on solar energy only or with fossil fuel backup. accounting for manufacturing, transportation and erection costs, and with manufacturing cost functions sensitive to system size and production volume, a single-shaft recuperated engine with different technological levels (low and high performance specifications) is considered. the results show that the specific cost of the base-case low performance system (1000 units/year) is slightly lower than 3300 epsilon/kw(e) but can be reduced by 27.3% if the annual production rate is multiplied by ten, or 40.4% if it is multiplied by a thousand. this cost is lower than that of dish-stirling systems but higher than for photovoltaic panels, even if at very high production voltimes. furthermore, the utilisation of high performance specifications reduces the cost of the system to 2500 e/kwe thanks to a substantial reduction of the size of the dish. at this cost level, the system has the potential to become competitive against photovoltaics under favourable environmental, political and market conditions.

suspension_bridge	for super-tall buildings, temperature is one of the most significant factors to affect the structural response. however, very few studies have been conducted on the temperature effects of the super-tall buildings due to their large size and complicated configuration. a long-term structural health monitoring (shm) system consisting of over 800 sensors of 16 types has been implemented on canton tower, a tube-in-tube super-tall structure for real-time monitoring at both construction and service stages. as one part of this sophisticated shm system, 48 and 96 temperature sensors have been deployed at 12 cross-sections of the inner and outer tubes, respectively. the real-time temperature at each measurement point could be collected through this system, but it 's still difficult to obtain the temperature distribution of the whole tower with limited measurement points. in this paper, the fe model of a typical section for inner tube and one for the column of the outer tube are constructed to investigate the temperature distribution through the heat transfer analysis. to verify the effectiveness of the model, the simulated results are compared with the field monitoring data. the simulated results show a good agreement with the measurements. the temperature distribution can be obtained by integrating the simulated and measured results and served as an input into the fe model of canton tower to calculate the temperature-induced deformation and force.
rainwater_harvesting	drought, water loss and soil erosion are the main factors limiting agricultural production in semi-arid regions of china. a field study was conducted to determine (1) the runoff efficiencies of different ridge widths (30,45 and 60 cm) covered with different materials (common plastic film, biodegradable mulching film and manual compacted soil) and (2) the effects of different ridge-furrow ratios (30:60, 45:60 and 60:60) and ridge-covering materials on soil water storage, topsoil temperature, hay yield, grain yield and water use efficiency (wue) of oats in ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting (rfrh) system at the dingxi agri-meteorological station, during 2 consecutive years of 2012 and 2013. average runoff efficiency was 18%, 20%, 22%, 71%, 77%, 83%, 76%, 77% and 84% for sr30, sr45, sr60, bmr30, bmr45, bmr60, cmr30, cmr45 and cmr60 (sr, bmr and cmr were ridges with compacted soil, covered with biodegradable mulch film and common plastic film, respectively, and subscript numbers 30,45 and 60 stand for ridge widths (cm)) over 2 years, respectively. the field experiment using oats as an indicator crop showed that mulching materials and ridge widths had distinct effects on topsoil temperature on the top of the ridges, but not in the bottom of the furrows. the soil water storage in the 140 cm depth of soil at the bottom of furrows increased with increasing ridge widths and in the order of cmr approximate to bmr >sr >fp (fp was the flat planting). the total precipitation was 414.4 mm in 2012 and 448.8 mm in 2013, which were higher than the average of rainfall (388.1 mm), leading to a significant increase of hay and grain yield in cmr, and an equivalent of hay and grain yield in bmr compared with fp in most cases. in the sr system, the positive effects of rainwater harvesting could not compensate for the negative effects of planting area reduction resulting in decrease in hay and grain yield. compared with fp, the average grain yield decreased by 19%, 27% and 34% for sr30, sr45 and sr60, and increased by 6%, 4%, 1%, 12%, 9% and 6% for bmr30, bmr45, bmr60, cmr30, cmr45 and cmr60 over 2 years, respectively. the wue of sr. bmr and cmr was 131, 1.41 and 1.47 times greater than that in fp over 2 years, and increased with increasing ridge width. the optimum furrow width was 32-38 cm for cmr and was 30-34 cm for bmr. future study is needed to investigate the impact of rfrh on crop production, wue and economic benefit under different precipitations, soil types, slopes and plant species using biodegradable mulching materials.

green_building	in this paper, we conduct research on the modern architecture planning and design patterns under green and low carbon background. nowadays, the development of the national green building although there is a big progress, but in order to realize in the true sense of the green building, on the one hand, it also need to pay more attention to feature in the architectural design and operation of concept of sustainable development. green building long-term development cannot leave the progress of science and technology and the efforts of construction industry, the green building to save resources and reduce energy consumption. this paper combines the state-of-the-art theoretical ideas to propose the modification terms for promoting the current status that is meaningful.
construction_management	building information modeling (bim) is a major upheaval in construction industry. although bim advantages in construction management has been proved in many papers reviewed, there are still many limitations that inhibit organizations to use bim models efficiently. however, advancement of application programming interface (api) in the recent years has facilitated employing bim in construction industry. this research contributes to the state of practice in construction management by developing api codes to automate estimation of construction. the developed api automatically filters items related to a particular discipline within a particular work area and facilitate systematical quantity take off in different work areas. this allows the planner to define proper 3d work areas and to estimate the required materials and man-hours in different work areas throughout the project. the results of the developed automated approach are compared with hand calculated results as well as the results calculated from the bim software interface in special cases. finally, the research has been validated by a case study of an actual petrochemical project.
green_building	the paper presents issues concerning realization of paradigm of sustainable design in the achitectural design of offices. special attention is given to relevant technical, formal and functional solutions, being the domain of interior architects creating the built environments of adequate indoor quality with substantial reduction of negative impact on natural environment. presented sustainable architectural interiors, completed in the last decade, have gained cerificates established by independent scientific institutions, assuring their accordance with exigencies of rating systems. the paper analyzes the formal methods of proper space planning, which assure high indoor environment quality parameters for the end users of office interiors in terms of optimum daylighyting of workstations and recreational areas as well as workers' visual contact with natural valuable surroundings. these requirements can be satisfactorily met by properly shaped inner space elements including partitions, ceilings, space-dividing structures as well as rational and effective use of finishing and building materials. technical and technological devices incorporated into the inner space mentioned in the paper are supposed to be essential complement of these design methods assuring proper daylight transmission and distribution in workspaces. discussed examples indicate the necessity of collaboration of interior architects with other professionals and consultants (i.e. green building accredited consultants), whose design contributions should be accepted and respected. integrated interior design process assured fulfilment of imperatives for sustainable architectural design of interiors.

smart_material	ionic polymer metal composite (ipmc) is a type of smart material that has gained the interest of many researchers due to its ability to achieve large displacements under small input voltages, usually less than 2.5 v. this has motivated the use of these materials in microsystems and systems in the millimeter scale, such as microgrippers. however, few of the control techniques developed thus far have considered the feasibility of using ipmcs in closed loop systems without the need of oversized external sensors. this paper presents a control scheme for a two-finger ipmc microgripper that accomplishes constant finger-tip displacements without external sensors. this scheme generates a displacement-dependent, time varying reference signal to obtain constant finger-tip displacements applied by a separate actuated ipmc. this actuator uses a pid controller tuned with a model-free approach, and is gain scheduled to span up to 1 mm finger-tip displacements. the microgripper achieves zero steady state error for finger-tip displacements on the tuned values of the pid controller. the gain scheduled pid controller is tested and results show zero steady state error to 0.25 mm displacements, and 15 and 20% steady state error when referenced to deflection of 0.45 and 0.75 mm, respectively. this shows that there is great confidence and validity of the control scheme, especially when tracking small reference deflections.
remote_sensing	the recent mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae hopkins) outbreaks had unprecedented effects on lodgepole pine (pinus contorta var. latifolia) in western north america. we used data from 165 forest inventory plots to analyze stand conditions that regulate lodgepole pine mortality across a wide range of stand structure and species composition at the fraser experimental forest in colorado, usa. forest inventory data were then combined with landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (etm +) imagery and boosted regression trees modeling to map outbreak severity (proportion of basal area killed). the outbreak severity map was evaluated with training (pseudo-r-2 = 0.63, rmse = 0.13) and independent test plots (pseudo-r-2 = 0.42, rmse = 0.27). this map was used to compare pine mortality in regenerating clearcuts and mature stands, which would have been problematic otherwise since regenerating clearcuts were underrepresented in the forest inventory data. mortality spanned from 0 to 99% of stand basal area, proportional to the abundance of pine in surveyed stands. during the outbreak, mortality was highest for larger-diameter trees; however, contrary to earlier outbreaks, beetles also attacked younger stands. pine mortality was lower in stands regenerating from clearcut harvests conducted between 1954 and 1985 than in mature stands and was more closely related to topographic factors than stand age or clearcut size; mortality was highest on southerly aspects and lower elevation sites, favorable to lodgepole pine. the best predictors for mapping outbreak severity were the change in the normalized difference moisture index between pre- and end-of-outbreak imagery and the end-of-outbreak etm+ band 5. a better understanding of mortality patterns relative to forest management can inform management planning and assessment of the influence of bark beetle outbreaks on ecosystem processes.

remote_sensing	an outstanding saharan dust event affected the iberian peninsula during winter 2016 (20 to 25 february). the impact of this event on ambient pm10 surface levels and its spatial and temporal evolution was investigated by means of data from 250 air quality stations across mainland spain and the balearic islands. the event had a significant impact on surface pm10 levels, and on 22 february, 90% of the air quality monitoring sites registered pm10 concentrations above the eu daily limit value of 50g/m(3). the study of the attenuated backscattering vertical profiles associated with african dust evidenced a complex structure, with a thick aerosol layer that was at higher altitudes over the pre-pyrenees compared to the coastal area of barcelona but closer to the surface than typically observed at both sites. optical and physical properties of dust particles were investigated at the continental background global atmosphere watch mountain observatory of montsec (msa) in the pre-pyrenees. good agreement was found between in situ and passive remote sensing methodologies once the aloft dust layer reached the msa station. scattering angstrom ngstrom exponent values decreased to values close to zero (even below zero for surface in situ measurements) indicating the predominance of coarse particles. on the contrary, absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent values increased during the saharan dust outbreak denoting an absorption enhancement at shorter wavelengths, characteristic of mineral dust particles. furthermore, the performance of nmmb/bsc-dust and bsc-dream8b models has been qualitatively evaluated for the dust spatial distribution across spain and the vertical structure over msa and barcelona showing good agreement.
rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting (rwh) techniques have been adapted in arid and semi-arid regions to minimise the risk from droughts. the demand for water has increased but water resources have become scarcer, so the assessment and modelling of surface water related to rwh in catchments has become a necessity. an understanding of the hydrological processes at the sub-catchment level is generally lacking, and little attention has been given to the assessment of rwh after implementation. the objective of this study was to develop a simple but generally applicable water-harvesting model and test it at sub-catchment level to evaluate and optimize the performance of rwh under different design and management scenarios. the model was applied to rainfall data for 1980-2004 in 25 sub-catchments of the watershed of wadi oum zessar (south-eastern tunisia). the performance and analysis of rwh in three types of years (dry, normal, and wet) are presented and discussed. this study emphasises the advantages of simulating long-term water balances at the sub-catchment level for improving our understanding of hydrological processes in the rwh system and provides several solutions for optimizing rwh performance in various scenarios. changing the spillway heights together with the flow directions had a significant impact on the performance of rwh by making 92% of all sub-catchments supply sufficient water for crop requirements, compared to 44% of the sub-catchments in case of no changes.

water_pollution	feeding interactions among functional feeding groups (ffgs) of macroinvertebrates are robust indicators of aquatic ecosystem interactions. they provide information regarding organic matter processing, habitat condition and trophic dynamics. in tropical rivers with pronounced wet and dry seasons, macroinvertebrate based ecological monitoring tools are explicitly focused on metrics and indices, while ignoring interactions of ffg5. therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the functional feeding type metrics, diversity indices and feeding interactions among ffg5 of macroinvertebrates along the water pollution gradient in gilgel gibe watershed, ethiopia. water quality parameters and macroinvertebrate community attributes were assessed for samples collected from upstream sites (15 sites), urban-impacted stretches (12 sites) and wetland-affected river zones (7 sites) of the watershed during the rainy (july) and dry (february) seasons. to understand the effect of pollution on the feeding interactions, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were analyzed. macroinvertebrate-based diversity indices and functional feeding type metric showed deterioration of ecological integrity at the urban-impacted sites and substantial recovery in the wetland-affected downstream sites. omnivorous feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates was noted for the upstream sites, whereas clear trophic guilds of ffg5 were suggested for the wetland-affected river zones by the stable isotope results. the results of pollution gradient analysis and feeding interactions among ffgs revealed that the urban-impacted sites showed weaker interactions when compared to upstream and wetland influenced sites. this affirms the potential importance of feeding interactions among ffgs of macroinvertebrates in water quality monitoring.

water_pollution	this work deals with the evaluation of the aqueous concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (drp), total phosphorus (tp), and ammonium nitrogen (n-nh4) in surface water by means of direct online instrumentation. a portable, submersible, and automated analyzer designed to measure dissolved and total nutrient concentrations characterized by miniaturization of the entire analytical process was tested against laboratory methods. a total number of 36 water samples of different origin (i.e., rain, river, lake, and sewage waters) were analyzed and used in the comparison of drp, tp, and n-nh4 data. raw data were distributed in a broad range of concentrations: 5-299 mu g p/l for drp, 7-97 mu g p/l for tp, and 11-332 mu g n/l for n-nh4. regression analysis underlined a high significant correlation between the measures of the probe and those of the laboratory (0.6 < r-2 < 0.9; p < 0.001) and pointed out the effectiveness of the new instrument in representing a broad range of nutrient concentrations.
solar_energy	in some parts of the globe, solar energy is available throughout the year. in areas where the terrain is mostly flat, it is justifiable to use solar power in the automotive industry. previous publication explored the concept of a solar-battery car with single and double solar array-trailers. solar array-trailers maximize the acquired solar energy thereby minimizing the use of battery power. the resulting excess power derived from solar-trailers can be used to drive the car and accessories that are necessary in some parts of the world. building on previously published results, this paper aims to determine the applicable limits of the car-trailer concept. variations to the reference configuration are considered, and the corresponding battery power needed is calculated. upper limits to the drag area coefficient, ground inclination, and rolling resistance are established. furthermore, an effective rolling resistance factor for the trailer is determined since manufacturing imperfections, component flexibilities and the misalignments of trailers limit the applicability of the car-trailer system. the use of trailers is not justifiable for an effective rolling resistance factor less than one. an ideal environment for the application of solar-battery cars, on a global scale, may be the drive across the australian continent along the stuart highway/highway1. such a drive is used by the world solar challenge to assess the performance of various categories of solar cars. a similar track is used in this publication to assess the response of solar-battery cars with solar-trailers. cumulative as well as daily energies required for such a drive are reported for a car, and a car with trailers. furthermore, the response under clear/cloudy conditions, throughout the year, is discussed. the results are compared with energies required by a typical 'race' car. the paper concludes with a summary of the results.

water_pollution	a large number of methods have been applied to evaluate genotoxic damage in different aquatic species. comet assay, as a method for detecting dna alterations, and micronucleus test, as an index of chromosomal damage are the most widely used and authentic methods in laboratory and field studies. the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the genotoxic effects of heavy metals generated by toxic industrial effluents and various kinds of pollutants from urban and agricultural areas and domestic waste on catla catla and cirrhinus mrigala due to water pollution in the chenab river, pakistan. the heavy metals cd, cu, mn. zn, pb, cr, sn, and hg were detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometry from water samples collected from predetermined sampling sites. all the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals were found to exceed the upper limits recommended by various agencies. comet assays showed significant (p < 0.05) dna damage in c. mrigala compared to c. catla for tail length and olive tail moment from three different sites. significant (p0.05) findings were observed between fish collected from farmed and non-polluted upstream waters. micronucleus assays showed similar findings for single and double micronucleus induction in c. catla and c. mrigala. a significantly (p < 0.05) higher micronuclei induction and percent tail dna was observed in c. mrigala specimen collected from the polluted site. these findings infer that dna damage could be used as a biomarker of pollution load and its early monitoring by using simple and reliable techniques such as the comet and micronucleus assays, expedient methods for toxicity screening of aquatic environments. regular monitoring is necessary to assess eco-health of the chenab river by choosing perhaps c. mrigala, being a bottom feeder, as a bioindicator that could provide more reliable information to determine the status of the environmental quality of the river.
water_pollution	with water scarcity becoming an increasingly critical issue for modern society, solar seawater desalination represents a promising approach to mitigating water shortage. in addition, solar seawater desalination shows great potential for mitigating the energy crisis due to its high photo-thermal conversion efficiency. however, the increasing contamination of seawater makes it difficult to generate clean water through simple desalination processes. in this work, clean water is generated by a,newly designed bifunctional au@tio2 core-shell nanoparticle film with a high photo-thermal conversion efficiency that is capable of photocatalysis and solar evaporation for seawater desalination. bifunctional films of au@tio2 core-shell nanoparticles with good stability were prepared. it was found that the formation of the core-shell structures played a key role in promoting the photo-thermal conversion efficiency and the evaporation of seawater, while the photocatalytic function demonstrated herein could contribute to the purification of polluted seawater. furthermore, the film structure can serve to concentrate the nps for the photo-reaction, as well as heat for water evaporation, improving both the photo-reaction efficiency and photo-thermal conversion efficiency. this efficient approach to solar seawater desalination, which combines evaporation with the photodegradation of pollutants, could help to address the dual issues of water scarcity and water pollution.

suspension_bridge	in this study, a noncontact main cable nde method has been developed. this cable nde method utilizes the direct current (dc) magnetization and a searching coil-based total flux measurement. a total flux sensor head prototype was fabricated that consists of an electro-magnet yoke and a searching coil sensor. to obtain a b-h loop, a magnetic field was generated by applying a cycle of low frequency direct current to the electro-magnet yoke. during the magnetization, a search coil sensor measures the electromotive force from magnetized cable. during the magnetization process, a search coil sensor was measured the magnetic flux density. total flux was calculated by integrating the measured magnetic flux using a fluxmeter. a b-h loop is obtained by using relationship between a cycle of input dc voltage and measured total flux. the b-h loop can reflect the property of the ferromagnetic materials. therefore, the cross-sectional loss of cable can be detected using variation of features from the b-h curve. to verify the feasibility of the proposed steel cable nde method, a series of experimental studies using a main-cable mock-up specimen has been performed in this study.
stealth_technology	stealth technology is of great importance and significance in reducing the radar cross section and improving the survivability of the target aircraft. absorber is one of the most important structures in stealth technology. however, the present investigations of absorbers mainly focus on the narrow band or multi-band. to extend the operation bandwidth, a graphene-based absorber structure is proposed in this paper. the proposed absorber has a periodic structure whose unit cell consists of a square and a circular graphene-based ring. the surface impedance of the periodic structure can be optimized to match the impedance of the free space in a very wide band by adjusting the electrostatic bias voltage. then the operation band is significantly extended. by using the commercial software, cst microwave studio 2014, the performance of the proposed absorber is studied. the simulated results show that the proposed absorber can absorb electromagnetic (em) waves in an ultra-wideband from 2.1 to 9.0 ghz, with an absorbing rate of up to 90%. moreover, the proposed absorber is insensitive to the polarization of the incident wave due to the symmetry of the structure. we also find that the absorber can be tuned to work at any frequency in a range from 2.0 to 9.0 ghz for a fixed geometrical parameter. the equivalent circuit model (ecm) approach and interference theory (inf) are employed to investigate the physical mechanism of the proposed absorber. according to the ecm, we analyze the resonant characteristics of the square and circular graphene rings. owing to the existence of two different graphene rings, two resonant frequencies are detected. by optimizing the structure parameters of the graphene rings, the two resonant frequencies are brought closer, resulting in the increase of the operation band. on the other hand, the real part of the input impedance of the equivalent circuit reaches up to about 300 omega, and the imaginary part is close to 0 omega, which provides good matching to the free space, leading to high absorption rate. according to the interference theory, the amplitudes and phases of the direct reflection and the multiple reflections of em waves are studied. it is found that the destructive interference between the direct reflection and multiple reflection makes the absorber have high performance in an ultra-wideband. the results obtained from ecm and inf are in good agreement with the simulation ones.
suspension_bridge	we study the existence of the homoclinic solution of a class of nonlinear fourth order ordinary differential equations, which involve particular cases of the extended fisher kolmogorov and swift-hohenberg equations. we address the case when the source term possesses a nonlinear dependence on the first order derivative of the solution. the main result follows from an iterative method using the sequence of solutions obtained through the mountain-pass technique. in order to illustrate this method some numerical examples are shown.

smart_material	transparent concrete is a cement-based building material which has optical properties due to the embedded light transmitting elements within the composite. in this study, the design of transparent concrete, its mechanical properties, light transmission properties of optical fibers and the use of optic fibers were discussed. the study was performed as a literature review, and it was focused on the light absorption of translucent concrete, transmission, the mechanism and losses in the transmission. information was given about their strength, materials and proportions. as a result, it was determined that the lighting power consumption will be reduced by utilizing the sun as the light source in buildings by the use of transparent concrete. moreover, it is seen that it provides architecturally aesthetic structures.
construction_management	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to compare the performance levels of small scale local government contractors (sslgcs) in northern part of nigeria with international practice. previous studies focused attention primarily on benchmarking the performance of contractors, but were mostly conceptual rather than from empirical findings. this continuous to pose a challenge to the sustainable development of the construction industry, particularly, in developing countries like nigeria. there is therefore a need to identify, assess and compare performance practice levels of small scale contractors. design/methodology/approach - the performance of each contractor was evaluated using a five-point likert scale used in obtaining mean performance levels in respect to three classes of performance practices. a questionnaire survey was administered to major parties in the industry; clients, contractors and consultants who were selected by using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique. the contractors' performance was compared by using anova with post hoc. findings - the results indicated that the sslgcs in nigeria were average performers and there were effects and differences among the various contractors' levels of performance with international practice. research limitations/implications - the study is limited to sslgcs in northern part of nigeria. practical implications - the study provided the criteria for evaluation of sslgcs' performance in nigeria and other developing countries that faced similar problems. social implications - the study created bases for self-evaluation and competition among small scale contractors in nigeria for the enhancement of productivity particularly in rural areas and general national development. originality/value - this study emanated from the governmental reports and past researches in the area of performance management on the persistence of the poor performance of small scale contractors in construction industry.
stealth_technology	a broadband broad-angle radar cross-sectional (rcs) reduction measure applicable to planar surfaces is proposed. this novel structure contains several layers of randomly displaced metal patches and layers are spaced by a quarter wavelength. specular reflection at normal incidence is suppressed by the phase cancellation technique. the reduction bandwidth is broadened by setting the layer surface area ratio based on binomial coefficients. because the structure contains no absorbent material, metal surfaces are divided into small patches and displaced randomly to avoid reflection peaks beyond the boresight direction. the rcs reduction effect is validated via measurements in a far-field antenna range. parametric studies and detailed discussions about this technique are conducted using simulation results computed from full-wave numerical tools, which include not only the specular reflection but also contributions from higher order scattering mechanisms. the proposed structure can be applied on planar target surfaces and has the potential to incorporate lossy dielectric loadings to reduce the structure thickness and suppress scatterings.
geotextile	the golden mussel (limnoperna fortunei) is a filter-collector macroinvertebrate species originating from southern china. it easily invades water transfer tunnels and attaches onto tunnel walls and structures with extremely high density, resulting in biofouling, pipe clogging, structure corrosion, a decrease in water transfer efficiency, and water pollution. it has become a prevalent problem and has caused concern all over the world. however, an effective and environment friendly method of controlling golden mussel invasion has not yet been approved. this study is aimed to propose measures for preventing golden mussel invasion and biofouling in the water transfer tunnels of the east river water source project (erwsp), which transfers water from the east river to shenzhen, southern china for 10 million people. long-term samplings and observations of the east river water were performed to study the golden mussel 's invading pattern. flume experiments were done to study the golden mussel 's attachment on 14 different materials and performance in turbulent flows. an integrated ecological prevention pool was designed and constructed based on the flume experimental results for preventing the golden mussel invasion in the scale model tunnels of the erwsp. the major technology of the ecological pool was preventing the golden mussel from entering the tunnels by attracting veligers to attach on geotextile cloth, attracting mussels to attach on bamboo, and killing veligers with high-frequency turbulence. an eight-month application experiment showed that the ecological pool successfully controlled the golden mussel invasion and biofouling in the scale model tunnels. the mussel density on the attachment materials decreased sharply as the distance of the materials from the pool entrance increased; the turbulence was effective in killing veligers that escaped from the attachment materials. no mussel was found on the model tunnels. thus, the integrated ecological prevention pool is recommended as a successful measure for controlling the golden mussel invasion and biofouling in water transfer tunnels.

solar_energy	this paper presents an evaluation of the building integrated solar thermal shading (bists) system on solar energy usage. a medium office building in los angeles defined by the u.s. department of energy (doe) was used in the case study. the bists louvers mounted on the south, east, and west facades of the building were used to harvest solar energy to supply domestic hot water (dhw), space heating and/or cooling. the solar thermal system was modeled and simulated in trnsys. solar fraction and solar useful efficiency were calculated, and a recommended operation strategy was proposed. the results indicated that: 1) potentially, the annual domestic hot water load can be fully supplied by the bists system. to achieve a recommended solar fraction 75%, either 10 m(2) collector on the south facade or 33 m2 collector on the east and west facades are required; 2) 20.2% of cooling load or 64.6% of heating load can be met by the remaining collectors. the bists on the south facade is primarily recommended to provide space heating and/or cooling; 3) combined heating and cooling enables the system to take more advantage of solar energy for energy savings from auxiliary heating.

ambient_intelligence	ambient intelligence healthcare systems (ami-hss) are increasingly being deployed in hospitals, nursing homes, medical environment with the aim of supporting physicians to manage the complexity of performing varied medical activities. such systems have to be able to handle multiple medical devices, and human activities in a dynamic environment in which people and things can evolve over time as well as change their position with respect to the operational ambient. design reliable ami-hss is of great importance since such system are considered safety-critical, but no software development life cycle (sdlc) exists that supports a design for reliability approach suited for ami-hs, which must abide by international regulations to guarantee safety and effectiveness. to fill this gap, in this work a evidence-oriented, risk-driven design methodology is proposed. the novelty of our approach consists of interleaving risk management activities within the sdlc, and by guiding the design using evidence produced via a probabilistic risk assessment approach.
remote_sensing	west nile virus (wnv) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus belonging to the japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the flaviviridae family. it is transmitted primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly culex spp. and aedes/ochlerotatus spp., which acquire the virus by feeding on viraemic birds. humans, horses and other mammals are regarded as incidental or dead-end hosts. in the last decades, an increasing number of cases of wnv infection in horses and humans have been notified in the mediterranean basin. in tunisia, human cases of wnv-related meningoencephalitis were detected in 1997, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012. based on the analysis of climatic and environmental conditions found in the locations where human cases have been reported in 2012, the aim of this study was to identify similar areas in tunisia potentially at risk of disease occurrence. data related to 85 neuroinvasive west nile fever (wnf) human cases were georeferenced and a set of environmental and climatic variables (wetlands and humid areas, normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), temperatures and elevation, migratory bird settlements) were used in the analysis. areas, ecologically similar to those where human cases were detected, were identified using the mahalanobis distance statistic. a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to validate the sensitivity of the model, and 78 of 85 points were correctly classified.
geotextile	the influence of the sand placement method above geotextile layer on interface shear strength behavior was investigated. seven different types of woven and nonwoven geotextiles were used with only poorly graded sand. the investigation involved placement of sand layer through inclined horizontal plane with different angles. this step constitutes a fundamental step for assessing soil to be deposited in different plane and, therefore, with different internal soil fabric. the interface shear strength was evaluated using direct shear test. although the investigated soil is uniform poorly graded sand, the influence of the deposit plane was significant especially for non-woven geotextile. differences in soil interface shear strength associated with the tested geotextile samples show that samples with higher mass per unit area and same opening sizes had the higher interface friction angle regardless the bedding plane.
solar_energy	sparked by growing pollution issues, research aiming at a better harvesting of solar energy in photo catalysts for environmental remediation has been thriving. in this study, a novel mixed valence state of co2.67s4 nanoparticles with full-spectrum-responsive photocatalytic activity had been fabricated via a facile solvothermal route. the as-synthesized samples were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), x-ray diffraction (xrd), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and uv-vis-nir diffuse reflection spectroscopy (uv-vis-nir drs). the photocatalytic performance of as-obtained samples had been investigated by the degradation of methylene blue (mb) in aqueous solution. the co2.67s4 nanoparticles with the particle size of 5-20 nm could degrade mb with the efficiency of 64%, 84% and 68% under the uv light, visible light and near-infrared light exposure, respectively. furthermore, a possible photocatalytic mechanism toward the near-infrared region had been proposed to be that the co2+/co3+ redox couple played vital parts in the photocatalytic activity of co2.67s4. this study provides a novel full solar spectrum-responsive photocatalyst for solar-light utility and environmental remediation.

ambient_intelligence	the home automation is one of the most customers of electrical energy after the industry. lighting represents on average about 15% of the annual electricity bill excluding gas and hot water. different studies have been made to reduce the electrical energy consumption like automatic switching and time programming. but all these techniques have not an important rate in reducing the electrical energy consumption. so we note that an intelligent lighting which varies with the users need remains important source of economy of the energy. the intelligent lighting is obtained by using ambient intelligence (ami). multi agent system (mas) have become the important paradigm to develop an ambient system because they have important characteristics like autonomy, proactivity and mobility to respond better to the main characteristic of ambient intelligence like the adaptability to the context. in this area, we propose an adaptive and intelligent lighting system in which each light source is represented by a software agent and the set of agents compose and coordinate their competences in order to illuminate a region with minimum energy consumption.
remote_sensing	urbanization is a natural and social process involving simultaneous changes to the earth 's land systems, energy flow, demographics, and the economy. understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of urbanization is increasingly important for policy formulation, decision making, and natural resource management. a combination of satellite remote sensing and patch-based models has been widely adopted to characterize landscape changes at various spatial and temporal scales. nevertheless, the validity of this type of framework in identifying long-term changes, especially subtle or gradual land modifications is seriously challenged. in this paper, we integrate annual image time series, continuous spatial indices, and non-parametric trend analysis into a spatiotemporal study of landscape dynamics over the phoenix metropolitan area from 1991 to 2010. we harness local indicators of spatial dependence and modified mann-kendall test to describe the monotonic trends in the quantity and spatial arrangement of two important land use land cover types: vegetation and built-up areas. results suggest that declines in vegetation and increases in built-up areas are the two prevalent types of changes across the region. vegetation increases mostly occur at the outskirts where new residential areas are developed from natural desert. a sizable proportion of vegetation declines and built-up increases are seen in the central and southeast part. extensive land conversion from agricultural fields into urban land use is one important driver of vegetation declines. the xeriscaping, practice also contributes to part of vegetation loss and an increasingly heterogeneous landscape. the quantitative framework proposed in this study provides a pathway to effective landscape mapping and change monitoring from a spatial statistical perspective.
remote_sensing	this research addressed the effects of downscaling cokriging land surface temperature (lst) on estimation of actual evapotranspiration (aet) from remote sensing images. two procedures were followed. we first applied downscaling cokriging to a coarse resolution lst product of modis at 1000 m. with its outcome, daily aet of a medium spatial resolution (250 m) was obtained using the surface energy balance system (sebs). second, we downscaled a coarse aet map to medium spatial resolution (250 m). for both procedures, the 250 m resolution modis ndvi product was used as a co-variable. validation was carried out using landsat 8 images, from which lst was derived from the thermal bands. the two procedures were applied to an agricultural area with a traditional irrigation network in iran. we obtained an average lst value of 305.8 k as compared to a downscaled lst value of 307.0 k. reference aet estimated with sebs using landsat 8 data was equal to 5.756 mm day(-1), as compared with a downscaled aet value of 5.571 mm day(-1). the rmse between reference aet and downscaled aet was equal to 1.26 mm day(-1) (r = 0.49) and between reference and downscaled lst to 3.67 k (r = 0.48). the study showed that aet values obtained with the two downscaling procedures were similar to each other, but that aet showed a higher spatial variability if obtained with downscaled lst. we concluded that lst had a large effect on producing aet maps from remote sensing (rs) images, and that downscaling cokriging was helpful to provide daily aet maps at medium spatial resolution.

construction_management	an effective theory-based intervention strategy is developed to improve worker adoption of a ventilated dust-control tool that reduces dust exposure by 95%. the prevention through design adoption readiness model (ptd arm) was employed to develop educational materials, hands-on training, and worksite cues-to-action. educational materials were targeted to improve worker knowledge of the health risks associated with construction dusts. hands-on training was developed with the objective of improving worker self-efficacy regarding the new equipment. additionally cues-to-action were given to the workers. these cues were hard-hat stickers and t-shirts with reminder slogans. in a pretest/posttest experimental design with control group (n=40), questionnaire data were analyzed using independent t-tests of the gain-scores, and significant changes (p<0.05) were seen in worker self-efficacy, trust-in-technology, and overall readiness to adopt the tool. theory-based intervention strategies were found to be effective in improving worker willingness to use ventilated tools. the most impactful intervention methods include training regarding risks to worker health, hands-on training with ventilated tools, and cues-to-action reminders to use the tools.
solar_energy	first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory reveal some superior physical properties of hydrogen and fluorine co-decorated silicene (hsif) monolayer and bilayer. our simulated results reveal that the hsif monolayer is a large direct band gap semiconductor greatly differing from the gap less semi-metallic silicene. there exists strong interlayer coupling in hsif bilayer, leading to the good stabilities of hsif bilayer even beyond bilayer graphene. the proposed hsif bilayer exhibits a moderate direct band gap of 0.296 ev which is much lower than that of hsif monolayer. encouragingly, hsif layers all have a direct band gap nature, irrespective of stacking pattern, thickness and external electric fields, which is an advantage over mos2 layers. furthermore, an out-of-plane electric field has an evident impact on the band structures of the hsif monolayer and bilayer. especially, the band gap of hsif bilayer can be effectively tuned by external electric field, even a semiconductor-metal transition occurs. more importantly, the hsif bilayer exhibits a significant improved visible light adsorption peak with respect to that of hsif monolayer, and the superior optical properties is robust, independent of stacking pattern. the complete electron-hole separation also enhances the photocatalytic efficiency of hsif bilayer. in a word, the moderate band gap, effective band gap modification by external electric field, robust direct band gap nature, suitable band edge positions, electron-hole separation, and fascinating visible light adsorption, which enable hsif bilayer to have great potential applications in the field of solar energy conversion, high performance photocatalysis and nanoelectronic devices, and we call for more concern over this kind of 2d janus materials which possesses excellent properties.

water_pollution	globally, water pollution is mainly caused by the presence of heavy metals and metalloids such as arsenic. the majority of the techniques employed in the removal are of low efficiency and high cost. therefore, in this work it is presented the adsorption processes of arsenic (as iii and v) ions employing magnetite nanoparticles (mnps) synthesized by the aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (aacvd) process. the adsorption efficiency was determined at different times and concentrations. the remaining as concentration in the solutions was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. the adsorbed as ions on the surface of the nmps was analyzed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. the results showed an overall removal efficiency of 87% for as+3 and 98% for as+5, in a contact time of 15 minutes. results suggested the use of nmps as a promising alternative in the removal of as ions in water.
geotextile	a series of bearing capacity tests were conducted with an eccentrically (e/b = 0, 1/12, 1/6, 1/3) loaded model surface (d-f/b = 0) and shallow (d-f/b = 0.25) strip footings (b = 80 mm) resting close to reinforced finite sand slopes to investigate ultimate loads, failure surfaces, load-displacement curves, rotation of footing, etc. the experimental set-up used to run the tests consists of a tank, model footing, sand, and a loading mechanism. a single woven geotextile strip sheet was placed horizontally below the footing 's base at a depth of half of the footing 's width. ultimate loads decreased with increasing eccentricity. this decrease is due to a combination of eccentricity and slope. the use of geotextile reinforcement increased ultimate loads in comparison with unreinforced cases. failure surfaces were not symmetrical, primary failure surfaces developed on the eccentricity (slope) side, and secondary failure surfaces developed on the other side. lengths of failure surfaces decreased with increasing eccentricity. prior to failure, footings always rotated towards the eccentricity (slope) side a few degrees.
remote_sensing	the new stage of the development of space-borne information systems is the creation of the global earth observation system. for the full functioning of such a system, it is necessary to provide the uniformity of measurements of all national systems as members of the global system, with high-quality measurement data. this requires the implementation of a high level of ground (prelaunch) calibration of earth remote sensing instruments. to solve these problems, there were created calibration facilities on the basis of large vacuum chambers with vacuum reference radiation sources, including sources on the basis of black bodies with a wide aperture of 500 mm in the spectral range from 3 mu m to 14 mu m. such a facility was created by fgup ""vniiofi"" in cooperationwith fgup ""tsniimash"". the ground calibration of earth remote sensing instruments is being carried out by using blackbody models as radiation sources with known spectral radiance. facility for ground calibration of remote sensing devices on spectral radiance is based on the usage of a large-aperture blackbody (labb) with 500 mm diameter and working temperature range from 213 k to 423 k, as a radiation source. this calibration setup comprises a set of reference blackbodies, such as a blackbody on the phase transition of gallium, a variable-temperature blackbody with temperature range from 213 k to 423 k, a reference blackbody cooled with liquid nitrogen, and ir fourier spectrometer utilized as a comparator to perform labb calibration on spectral radiance. the second important characteristic of labb is the uniformity of spectral radiance across the radiating aperture of this blackbody. the paper describes the device for measuring the spatial homogeneity of the radiation power of the labb 's radiating surface. this device is based on the use of two-color insb-cdhgte detector equipped with modulator and ir lens, which are mounted on a two-axis translation stage suitable for operation in vacuum and installed in the vacuum chamber against labb. during the measurement of the radiation uniformity, the modulator sequentially sends probing radiation spot either from the labb 's surface or from the thermostatic radiation source to the detector input. the principle of operation of the device is described. the results of measurements of the radiation power homogeneity across the labb 's radiating aperture are presented in wide-temperature range.
stealth_technology	this paper presents the design, simulation and fabrication of a frequency selective surface (fss) based unit cell structure over a flexible polyimide film for the effective electromagnetic absorption. the proposed fss structure is designed using the splitted rings, where the unit cell dimensions are selected for effective em absorption in the x band. the simulated results show absorption of 99.25% at 11.20 ghz having film thickness of 135 mu m. the proposed absorber film is effectively being used for the radar cross section (rcs) reduction of a cubical object. the proposed structure is fabricated and tested for the electromagnetic absorption as well as for the rcs reduction. a close match between the simulated and the experimental results is observed. the proposed fss structure is ultrathin, flexible and flame retardant, which makes it a good potential candidate for the rf stealth technology.
smart_material	wind energy is one of the renewable energy sources which the trend is positive and increasing year by year. this technology applied widely in several regions in the world and already has maturity in technology, good infrastructure and relative cost competitiveness. the application of structural health monitoring (shm) is crucial especially to evaluate the performance of wind turbine in real time assessment. furthermore, the smart material in shm can be utilized as micro energy harvester as well. however, the application of shm and micro energy harvester for wind turbine is still premature especially in shm embedded or bonded strategy. several issues are highlighted such as shm material selection, wind turbine selection and the issue in micro energy harvester. the issues are discussed and compared with the recent finding in this review. several recommendations are suggested for future study especially on the application of micro energy harverster.
remote_sensing	priority wise channelization of resources is the key to successful environmental management, especially when funds are limited. the study in hand has successfully developed an algorithmic criterion to compare hazardous effects of municipal solid waste (msw) dumping sites quantitatively. it is a multi criteria analysis (mca) that has made use of the scaling function to normalize the data values, analytical hierarchy process (ahp) for assigning weights to input parameters showing their relevant importance, and weighted linear combination (wlc) for aggregating the normalized scores. input parameters have been divided into three classes namely resident 's concerns, groundwater vulnerability and surface facilities. remote sensing data and gis analysis were used to prepare most of the input data. to elaborate the idea, four dumpsites have been chosen as case study, namely old-fsd, new-fsd, saggian and mahmood booti. the comparison has been made first at class levels and then class scores have been aggregated into environmental normalized index for environmental impact ranking. the hierarchy of goodness found for the selected sites is new-fsd >old-fsd >mahmood booti >saggian with comparative scores of goodness to environment as 36.67, 28.43, 21.26 and 13.63 respectively. flexibility of proposed model to adjust any number of classes and parameters in one class will be very helpful for developing world where availability of data is the biggest hurdle in research based environmental sustainability planning. the model can be run even without purchasing satellite data and gis software, with little inaccuracy, using imagery and measurement tools provided by google earth.
green_building	frameworks of environmental regulations are fundamental yet problematic factors in achieving climate mitigation and adaptation policy goals. recent theoretical arguments claim the value of general legal frameworks to enable experimentation and contextual adaptation of policies. however, empirical research regarding the effects of both general and specific norms in the practice of urban intervention remains limited. in this article we empirically discern how city governments deal with the tension between control and flexibility in the implementation of urban climate change goals. we argue that policies of adaptation/mitigation face two types of implementation problems: non-adaptive implementation and non-implementation. the first stems from an excessively constraining use of rules, while the second derives from a too general and undefined regulatory framework. analysing two empirical cases in amsterdam, netherlands and boston, ma, usa, we conclude that there are three elements that affect the way actors deal with these deficits: the level of scale at which regulations are established, the degree of land ownership which provides margin of manoeuvre to public authorities, and the sense of political urgency behind mitigation and adaptation
remote_sensing	water is a crucial resource in west africa, where large parts of the population rely on rainfed agriculture. therefore, accurate knowledge of the water resources is of the utmost importance. due to the declining number of rain gauging stations, the use of satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets in hydrological modelling is steadily rising. however, accurate information on the benefits and deficits of these datasets is often lacking, especially in the west african subcontinent. for validation purposes, these products are commonly compared to freely available rain gauge data, which has in some cases already been used to bias correct the products in the first place. we therefore explored the possibility of a hydrological evaluation, where a model is calibrated for each dataset using streamflow as the observed variable. in this study, ten freely available satellite and reanalysis datasets (cfsr, chirps, cmorphv1.0 crt, cmorphv1.0 raw, persiann cdr, rfe 2.0, tamsat, tmpa 3b42v7, tmpa 3b42 rtv7 and gpcc fddvl) were thus evaluated for six differently sized and located basins in west africa. results show that while performances differ, most datasets manage to somewhat accurately predict the observed stream flow in a given basin. best results were achieved by datasets which use a multitude of input data, namely infrared and microwave satellite data, as well as observations from rain gauges (usually gpcc) for bias correction. if considering only the nash sutcliffe efficiency averaged for all six basins during the calibration phase, best results were achieved by cmorph crt and persiann cdr (both 0.66), followed by tamsat, chirps and tmpa 3b42 (all three 0.64). average results were achieved by rfe 2.0 (0.63), gpcc (0.61) and tmpa 3b42 rt (0.54). cmorph raw and cfsr performed worst (0.36 and -0.34 on average).

ambient_intelligence	this paper presents a method for touch-based gesture recognition that can be used in human-centered interfaces for ambient intelligence applications. gestures are associated with shapes and they are represented using fourier coefficients. neural networks, decision trees, naive bayes and a set of classifiers (based on linear discriminant analysis) are tested for gesture recognition. all these methods are evaluated based on accuracy, training and recognition time. also an application controlled by user using touch-based gestures is implemented.
construction_management	as construction projects become larger and more diversified, various factors such as time, cost, quality, environment, and safety that need to be considered make it very difficult to make the final decision. this study was conducted to develop an integrated multi-objective optimization (imoo) model that provides the optimal solution set based on the concept of the pareto front, through the following six steps: (1) problem statement; (2) definition of the optimization objectives; (3) establishment of the data structure; (4) standardization of the optimization objectives; (5) definition of the fitness function; and (6) introduction of the genetic algorithm. to evaluate the robustness and reliability of the proposed imoo model, a case study on the construction time-cost trade-off problem was analyzed in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. the results of this study can be used: (1) to assess more than two optimization objectives, such as the initial investment cost, operation and maintenance cost, and co2 emission trading cost; (2) to take advantage of the weights as the real meanings; (3) to evaluate the four types of fitness functions; and (4) to expand into other areas such as the indoor air quality, materials, and energy use.
ambient_intelligence	ambient intelligence promises to transform current spaces into electronic environments that are responsive, assistive and sensitive to human presence. those electronic environments will be fully populated with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of connected devices that share information and thus become intelligent. that massive wave of electronic devices will also invade everyday objects, turning them into smart entities, keeping their native features and characteristics while seamlessly promoting them to a new class of thinking and reasoning everyday objects. although there are strong expectations that most of the users' needs can be fulfilled without their intervention, there are still situations where interaction is required. this paper presents work being done in the field of human-computer interaction, focusing on smart home environments, while being a part of a larger project called aging inside a smart home. this initiative arose as a way to deal with a large scourge of our country, where lots of elderly persons live alone in their homes, often with limited or no physical mobility. the project relies on the mobile agent computing paradigm in order to create a virtual butler that provides the interface between the elderly and the smart home infrastructure. the virtual butler is receptive to user questions, answering them according to the context and knowledge of the aish. it is also capable of interacting with the user whenever it senses that something has gone wrong, notifying next of kin and/or medical services, etc. the virtual butler is aware of the user location and moves to the computing device which is closest to the user, in order to be always present. its avatar can also run in handheld devices keeping its main functionality in order to track user when s/he goes out. according to the evaluation carried out, the virtual butler is assessed as a very interesting and loved digital friend, filling the gap between the user and the smart home. the evaluation also showed that the virtual butler concept can be easily ported to other types of possible smart and assistive environments like airports, hospitals, shopping malls, offices, etc.
ambient_intelligence	activity recognition of an elderly person can be used to provide information and intelligent services to health care professionals, carers, elderly people, and their families so that the elderly people can remain at homes independently. this study investigates the use and contribution of wrist-worn multisensors for activity recognition. we found that accelerometers are the most important sensors and heart rate data can be used to boost classification of activities with diverse heart rates. we propose a genetic algorithm-based fusion weight selection (gafw) approach which utilizes ga to find fusion weights. for all possible classifier combinations and fusion methods, the study shows that 98% of times gafw can achieve equal or higher accuracy than the best classifier within the group.
construction_management	the work of contractors mainly comes from bidding strategy, they take this as the main process of the construction project life cycle. and also, it is the most important part to be discussed in the construction management field. this case study considers the economic environment changes, objectively uses the economic analysis of financial management and further subjectively evaluates the utility function to get the optimal return rate and the bid price at the maximum expected utility increasing under interest rate, inflation rate, reinvestment rate and other economic environment variables, to help decision-makers can make the most suitable and competitive bidding decision.
remote_sensing	to compensate for the limitations of optical remote sensing when restricted by cloud cover, it is worth exploring how to detect cyanobacterial blooms using synthetic aperture radar (sar), which can penetrate clouds. a satellite-ground synchronous experiment was conducted in lake taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in china. a lipopeptide biosurfactant was detected in the algal scum layer, with an average content of 1.8 g/l. the viscosity (1.41 to 332 mpa. s) of the scum was significantly higher than that of scum-free water. the surface tension of the algal scum decreased by 12.5%, and the sar microwave backscatter was reduced by 7.3 db. this indicated that the cyanobacterial scum could effectively attenuate capillary waves and appear as dark patches in sar images. sar has the potential to be developed as a tool for the remote sensing of algal scum in lake waters.

construction_management	program (or project) evaluation review technique (pert) has remained a modern method in project scheduling for decades. since its invention, numerous authors have tried modifications to its basic method in an attempt to overcome its intrinsic drawbacks. in this paper, the authors research improvements to the fuzzy version of pert. the initial motivation is the avoidance of the backward recursion problem in fuzzy pert, with fuzzy input data for the task durations through an alternative approach. furthermore, the authors propose various membership functions for the representation of the fuzzy task duration in accordance with the nature of each task. this approach is intended to give more realistic results. the tools for this operation are the possibilistic mean and the possibilistic variance of fuzzy numbers. the possibilistic method acts as a defuzzification method that results in a crisp value as an outcome both for the task times (earliest/latest start - earliest/latest finish) and for the floats (total/free/safety). the authors also base this study on estimates of experts in project scheduling who are experienced in time management. a practical application is also provided for a better comprehension of the proposed method.

geotextile	the flood protection methods can affect the erosion process of dam-breaking which determines the volume of failure and dam final profile. this article focuses on the experimental models with different protection methods for dam-breaking flood by overtopping. the experiments were conducted in a rectangular tank with an erodible barrier dam made from cohesive sand, including five flood protection methods: diversion trench at the side wall, diversion trench in the middle, wire box, cement protection and geotextile waterproof, to observe and investigate erosion processes. the different water heads between reservoir and downstream of dam over time changing contribute to various inner destructive mechanisms and erosion processes in three directions (vertical, horizontal and backward), which resulted in different erosion volumes. the initial dam-breaking erosion process of barrier dam is related with evacuation of people in downstream area and the final erosion volume is bound up with coverage area of flood as well as the extent of damage. therefore, we concentrate on the analysis of the initial developmental process and the total erosion value. the results show that the wire box, cement protection and geotextile waterproof can effectively retard the growing larger volume of flood and the diversion trench in the middle can cause the largest erosion volume of dam body. and the erosion processes are determined by the interaction of erosion abilities in three directions. also, the estimates are presented of the retrogressive erosion velocity, transverse broadening velocity, vertical incision velocity.
ambient_intelligence	this paper presents a concrete software architecture dedicated to ambient intelligence (ami) features and requirements. the proposed behavioral model, called higher-order agent (hoa) captures the evolution of the mental representation of the agent and the one of its plan simultaneously. plan expressions are written and composed using a formal algebraic language, namely aglotos, so that plans are built automatically and on the fly, as a system of concurrent processes. based on a specific semantics, a guidance service is also proposed to assist the agent in its execution. moreover due to the specific structure of aglotos expressions, the update of sub-plans is realized automatically accordingly to the revising of intentions, hence maintaining the consistency of the agent.
smart_material	liquid-crystal elastomers (lces) are an exciting kind of smart material that can convert thermo- and opto-stimuli into mechanical actuations. in this paper, we formulate an opto-mechanical constitutive relation of soft lces for different director orientations, which shows that the soft material becomes transversally isotropic and quasi-soft under light illuminations and also the opto-strains are produced. we consider plane stress problems for simplification, with director variation through the depth of the beam-shaped lces. detailed finite element simulations of two-dimensional free standing samples indicate that both the direction and the magnitude of the light-induced bending strongly depend on the orientation of the director and that the lces can behave completely soft under light illuminations at a critical orientation of the director, namely, the samples deform stress-freely in shear without bending. fe results show that large shear deformation is inevitably produced due to the rotation of the director, which means that the cross section plane will not remain normal to the middle line after deformation. and even some distortions may happen to cross sections, particularly when the orientation of lc is not parallel or perpendicular to the direction of light propagation.
suspension_bridge	the aeroelastic behavior of suspension bridges under generic temporal and space wind distributions is studied employing a parametric one-dimensional structural model coupled with a strip-based indicial representation of the unsteady aerodynamic loads. the aeroelastic response to spatially nonuniform gusts is also investigated. the equations of motion linearized about the prestressed aerostatic equilibrium are expressed in terms of incremental kinematic variables. the aerodynamic loading characteristics of the deck cross sections of the runyang suspension bridge (over the yangtze river in china) are evaluated by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations performed to extract the aeroelastic derivatives from which the indicial aerodynamic representation is obtained. the aeroelastic equations of motion are then reduced to the state-space ordinary differential form by using the faedo-galerkin approach. the reduced-order bridge dynamics and the description of the aerodynamic loading via the added aerodynamic states are solved simultaneously by using a time-integration numerical scheme. dependence of the flutter condition and the transient response to gusts is shown through systematic parametric studies.

remote_sensing	we present the instrumentation and results of spectroscopic remote sensing of atmospheric no2 levels based on recording spectra of visible solar radiation scattered from the zenith sky, carried out in the central part of st. petersburg in 2009-2016. the data obtained qualitatively agree with the results of simultaneous analogous measurements in a suburb of st. petersburg (petrodvorets), and also with data from the closest satellite measurements.
green_building	the energy efficiency of urban infrastructure is in large part influenced by the efficient utilization of transportation and building systems. opportunities for more efficient utilization of transportation and building systems are available in the context of commercial office building/site selection. office location decision makers have an opportunity to select buildings and locations that potentially minimize building and transportation energy consumption within a given urban context. the objective of the research presented in this paper was to apply a calculation framework for estimating the potential transportation energy and building energy consumption of commercial office building/site alternatives. the calculation framework was applied to case studies of commercial office buildings/sites that represent typical developments found in the transportation and land-use context of the atlanta, georgia, metropolitan region. the framework leverages building energy simulation models and regional travel demand model data to estimate energy performance under uncertainty. importantly, the calculation results indicate that transportation is a major determinant of commercial office building/site energy performance. incorporation of the framework into sustainable development policy or market transformation tools (e.g.,green building rating systems) could accommodate more performance-based planning of efficient infrastructure utilization.

suspension_bridge	several frameworks for the dynamic analysis of wind-vehicle-bridge systems were presented in the past decade to study the safety or ride comfort of road vehicles as they pass through bridges under crosswinds. the wind loads on the vehicles were generally formed based on the aerodynamic parameters of the stationary vehicles on the ground, and the wind loads for the pure bridge decks without the effects of road vehicles. and very few studies were carried out to explore the dynamic effects of the aerodynamic interference between road vehicles and bridge decks, particularly for the moving road vehicles. in this study, the aerodynamic parameters for both the moving road vehicle and the deck considering the mutually-affected aerodynamic effects are formulized firstly. and the corresponding wind loads on the road vehicle-bridge system are obtained. then a refined analytical framework of the wvb system incorporating the resultant wind loads, a driver model, and the road roughness in plane to fully consider the lateral motion of the road vehicle under crosswinds is proposed. it is shown that obvious lateral and yaw motions of the road vehicle occur. for the selected single road vehicle passing a long span bridge, slight effects are caused by the aerodynamic interference between the moving vehicle and deck on the dynamic responses of the system.
rainwater_harvesting	water shortage in karst mountainous areas is a difficult problem faced worldwide. serious surface water leakage, which is a karst characteristic, has puzzled global scientists for a long time. local climate and hydrology play important roles in water resources occurrence and behaviour, which in turn affects surface and groundwater management. the objectives of this study were as follows: to conduct in-depth analysis of the major problems in the current utilisation on the surface water resources in karst areas; to reveal the differences in surface hydrogeological structures that grew and formed under the control of different lithological characters, surface water occurrence conditions and its cyclical rules; to propose strategies for development and effective utilisation of water resources. a series of technologies for karst surface water resource use on the basis of karst hydrogeological features and development law is proposed. these technologies include gully section runoff confluence water harvesting technology, surface karst spring directional diversion technology, sunken geomorphology ecotype cistern design technology, road rainwater-harvesting and effective utilisation technology, effective comprehensive and utilisation of rooftop rainwater harvesting technology and other surface water resource optimal allocation technologies. thus, this study offers research-driven technological solutions to ease water shortage, facilitate modern agriculture and regional economic development in karst mountainous areas.

construction_management	ineffective communication and the poor application of communication skills in construction project management lead to project outcomes that do not meet project objectives. the lack of a proper communication skills model for project management may contribute to ineffective project communication. this article reports the results of a study done to identify the most important project management communication skills and applications of communication that effective project managers should possess. a literature review on project management communication, project communication skills, applications of project communication and project management and leadership communication was done to develop a quantitative questionnaire for testing the importance of project management communication skills and applications of communication as perceived by a total of 97 construction-related professionals employed in construction project management, architecture, construction management, engineering and quantity surveying. based on the findings, the communication skills and applications of communication expected from project managers were grouped into core (decision-making, problem-solving, listening, verbal competency, motivation, persuasion, meetings, writing competency, presentation, team-building and development, conflict management) and important skills (negotiation, trust, explaining, questioning, reinforcement, reflecting, public communication, humour and laughter, self-disclosure) which, together with managerial and leadership communication, form the main basis of the proposed model. the proposed model may assist construction project managers in developing their communication abilities, and through improved communication, improve their management and leadership abilities, ensuring the successful execution of projects in the south african construction industry.
suspension_bridge	in this paper, an efficient analysis method considering both geometric and material nonlinearities is proposed for predicting the ultimate strength and behavior of multi-span suspension bridges. the geometric nonlinearities of the cable members due to sag effects are captured using the catenary element, while the geometric nonlinearities of the beam-column members due to second-order effects are captured using the stability functions. the material nonlinearities of the cable and beam-column members are considered using elastic-plastic hinge and refined plastic hinge models, respectively. a simple initial shape analysis method is presented to determine the deformed shape and initial cable tension of the bridge under dead loads. numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. in addition, a case study on a four-span suspension bridge is carried out to show the capability of the proposed method in estimating the strength and behavior of very large scale structures.

rainwater_harvesting	harvesting rainwater is a common practice worldwide, particularly in areas with no access to a public water supply or insufficient groundwater reserves. more than two million people living in semiarid regions of brazil consume rainwater stored in cisterns, and little information is available regarding the water quality. despite the initial good quality of the rainwater, its harvest and storage can introduce contaminants that must be eliminated before consumption. to evaluate the influence of handling, cistern age and precipitation on the quality of harvested rainwater, we monitored seven cisterns in the semiarid brazilian northeast over 4 years. microbial and physicochemical parameters were monitored once a month, and denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was performed at the end of the monitoring period. coliform bacteria were detected in 100% of samples, while escherichia coli were observed in 73.8%. the alkalinity and conductivity were the highest for the recently built cisterns due to the dissolution of construction materials. the dgge of the 16s r dna did not reveal the presence of e. coli. instead, dgge bands sequencing indicated that species primarily affiliated with alphaproteobacteria were present in all cisterns, indicating the presence of microbial ecosystems capable of purifying and stabilizing the stored rainwater.
water_pollution	nitrate pollution, primarily in groundwater (gw), has been one of major water pollution problems in europe over the last 30 years. specially, mediterranean areas (semi-arid zones) are more vulnerable to nitrate pollution, as in these areas a small excess of nitrogen produce higher nitrate concentrations than in more humid countries because the aquifer recharge is minor. a large number of gw bodies in the jucar river basin district (rbd) (43.000 km(2)), located in spain, has nitrate concentrations above 50 mg/l. the water framework directive (wfd) sets out the goal of good status for the water bodies of the european union, which also implies compliance with the nitrates directive. the river basin authorities (rbas) must define the measures needed to reach the environmental objectives in the river basin management plans (rbmps), considering the long time-lag of aquifers is decisive in the measures effectiveness. by means of nitrogen cycle simulation in the river basin district and with the help of the monthly distributed patrical model, the jucar rba has defined the measures to be applied and the exemptions to reach the objectives in gw in relation to nitrate pollution. both, model and methodology are useful for other river basins to define measures. the total nitrogen inputs in the jucar rbd amounts to 180,000 tn/year, which represents a nitrogen surplus of 80,000 tn/year and a pressure of 58.5 kgn/year/ha-crop. around 3/4 of gwbodies have currently the good status while the remaining of gw bodies could reach the good status during following hydrological planning cycles through the implementation of modernized irrigation systems that include fertigation -the use of fertilizers in the water for irrigation. the implementation of this scenario involves increasing efficiency in fertilizer application, in order to reduce nitrogen losses from slightly under a half to <1/3.

geotextile	this paper presents a series of unconsolidated-undrained (uu) triaxial compression tests for investigating the behavior and failure mechanism of geotextile-reinforced clay and the effects of sandwiching nonwoven geotextile in a thin layer of sand (sandwich technique) on improving the shear strength of reinforced clay. test variables include confining pressures, the number of geotextile layers, and thicknesses of the sand layers. the mobilized tensile strain of reinforcements, estimated according to the residual tensile strain by using a digital image-processing technique, was used to directly quantify the effects of soil-geotextile interaction on the shear-strength improvement. the test results showed that the shear strength of reinforced clay increased as the number of geotextile layers was increased. failure patterns were changed from classical rankine-type failures for unreinforced soil specimens to bulging (barrel-shaped) failures between adjacent geotextile layers. the effectiveness of reinforcing clay by applying nonwoven geotextile can be attributed to an increase in the apparent cohesion of the reinforced clay specimen. regarding the sandwich technique, the test results revealed that layers of sand encapsulating the reinforcement can effectively provide an improved soil-geotextile interaction, thereby enhancing the shear behavior of reinforced clay. the shear strength increased as the thickness of the sand layer was increased. an optimal value of sand-layer thickness for maximum shear-strength improvement was not observed at large confining pressures. an appreciable shear-strength improvement was still observed when the sand-layer thickness was increased from 15 to 20 mm at sigma(3) >100 kpa. the sandwich technique contributes to shear-strength improvement by increasing the friction angle of reinforced specimens. the mobilized tensile strain and force of the geotextile increased as the number of geotextile layers, thicknesses of the sand layers, and confining pressure were increased. the mobilized tensile strain and force were strongly correlated to the strength difference between reinforced and unreinforced soil. this experimental finding demonstrated that mobilized tensile strain and force directly contribute to the shear-strength improvement of reinforced clay.

geotextile	natural cellulosic fibres such as flax fibres present interesting mechanical properties as well as biodegradability, and by-products, such as short flax fibres, could be used to produce geotextiles to stabilise soils. today, geotextiles are often made of coir fibres, which have a high lignin percentage leading to their slow degradation in soil. fibres with a high cellulosic content, such as those of flax, exhibit lower resistance to soil degradation. this study investigates solutions to improve this parameter with a view to increasing their service life and therefore their credibility compared to coir fibres for geotextile applications. for this purpose, a cellulose coating of yarns made of short flax fibres was performed and its stability under a water flow was assessed. the ability to form a cellulose sheath was estimated by chromaticity measurements of flax fibres after applying a dye specific to lignin. infrared spectrometry analysis to monitor the level of protection against degradation by cellulolytic enzymes was also carried out. it appears that the cellulose coating provides an efficient physical protection, preventing access of these enzymes to their fibrous substrate. then, the possibility of conferring antibacterial properties on the cellulose coating by chelating phytoalexin molecules such as gramine on it was assayed and proven to be effective against soil cellulolytic bacteria such as cellvibrio fulvus and cellvibrio vulgaris. this study therefore establishes that coating flax yarns with cellulose associated with antibacterial molecules could contribute to obtaining a longer service life in soil for geotextiles manufactured from flax fibres.

suspension_bridge	the effectiveness of limestone sand fines (material finer than 0.063 mm) in controlling durability performance of slag cement concrete was investigated in an experimental program. slag cement concrete specimens incorporating limestone aggregate were produced in two water-cement ratios leading to moderate and high-level durability. linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate the rates and significance of change in durability performance parameters of concrete at varied levels of fines content ranging between 0 and 15%. significant relationships between performance parameters (compressive strength, water penetration resistance, chloride migration coefficient, resistivity and abrasion resistance) and fines content were found in statistical analysis depending on the water-cement ratio. compared to low water cement ratio concrete specimens, the contribution of the fines on durability was more prominent for the concrete mixes with high water-cement ratio. the paper also presents a case-study on durability assessment in an on-going marine infrastructure project involving izmit bay crossing suspension bridge. the findings obtained from the field conform with the output of this research.

ambient_intelligence	human activity recognition (har) is an important part of ambient intelligence systems since it can provide user-context information, thus allowing a greater personalization of services. one of the problems with har systems is that the labeling process for the training data is costly, which has hindered its practical application. a common approach is to train a general model with the aggregated data from all users. the problem is that for a new target user, this model can perform poorly because it is biased towards the majority type of users and does not take into account the particular characteristics of the target user. to overcome this limitation, a user-dependent model can be trained with data only from the target user that will be optimal for this particular user; however, this requires a considerable amount of labeled data, which is cumbersome to obtain. in this work, we propose a method to build a personalized model for a given target user that does not require large amounts of labeled data. our method uses data already labeled by a community of users to complement the scarce labeled data of the target user. our results showed that the personalized model outperformed the general and the user-dependent models when labeled data is scarce.
construction_management	it is widely accepted that the evolution of building information modeling (bim) is increasingly affecting the roles of construction management professionals in the architecture, engineering and construction (aec) industry. teaching bim in construction engineering and project management (cepm) curricula requires more emphasis on learning bim as a process improvement methodology rather than only a technology. this paper describes experiences of a university course on building information modeling that was developed to educate the next generation construction managers to understand bim and effectively use an existing bim in plan execution for construction projects. this is a project-based course where students gain knowledge on the implementation of bim concepts throughout the lifecycle of a project. findings and lessons learned from the teaching experience in seven offerings of the course are documented.
suspension_bridge	this paper presents a general frequency domain framework for predicting multimode coupled buffeting response of long-span bridges to nonstationary winds. within this framework, the wind speed field, aerodynamic forces, and bridge response are separated into deterministic time-varying mean and evolutionary random fluctuating components. under the assumption of low variation rate of mean wind speed, the time-varying mean and self-excited and buffeting forces are modeled in static force coefficients, flutter derivatives, and admittance functions, determined in a wind tunnel under stationary wind, but with consideration of nonstationary wind characteristics in a quasi-steady manner. the time-varying mean bridge response is calculated through static analysis at each time instant. the random buffeting response is expressed in generalized modal displacements governed by the equations of a frequency-dependent linear time-variant (ltv) system. an equivalent frequency-independent ltv system is introduced, which permits calculation of response impulse functions directly from system modal properties at each frozen time. formulations are presented for calculating time-varying rms value and evolutionary spectrum of bridge response and its extreme value distribution. the traditional buffeting analysis framework for stationary wind excitations is the special case of this general framework. based on this analysis framework, the buffeting responses of a long-span suspension bridge with a center span of approximately 2,000 m under various nonstationary winds are investigated, which shed insights on the general characteristics of nonstationary wind load effects on long-span bridges. the effectiveness and accuracy of the framework are also confirmed through time domain monte carlo simulations.

stealth_technology	satellites play an irreplaceable role in human daily life, more and more satellites are being sent into space. at the same time, foreign space powers are competing to develop the satellite stealth technology, the safety factors and survival ability of the satellite ca n't be ignored. analysis of space surveillance system for high orbit satellite has a strong optical detection capability; optical visibility of spatial objects; and the optical brightness of the typical satellite body. finally, it is pointed out that the development of satellite optical stealth technology is imperative.
green_building	low carbon policies, including those aimed at increasing water efficiency, have been adopted as a crucial strategy for combating global warming and climate change. the green building evaluation system used in taiwan was first applied in 1999 and initially utilized a building 's water efficiency as the threshold index for determining the building 's environmental impact. since 1999, more than a thousand buildings have been certified as green buildings using this evaluation system. the quantitative effects of water conservation efforts should be provided to policy makers as a form of positive feedback. to that end, the present study offers a calculation process for estimating the quantitative volume of water saved by practical green buildings. the baseline water usage for all kinds of buildings was determined to serve as the criterion for determining the water-saving efficiency of individual buildings. an investigation of the average water-saving rate from 2000 to 2013 for 1320 buildings certified as green buildings was also conducted to validate the estimation results and found that these green buildings saved an average of approximately 37.6% compared to the baseline water usage rate for all buildings. water savings will inevitably follow from the use of water-saving appliances or water-saving designs for buildings. the proposed calculation process can be used to clarify the relationships between specific water-saving concepts and the real water usage efficiency of green buildings.
remote_sensing	integrating knowledge of environmental degradation, biodiversity change, and ecosystem processes across large spatial scales remains a key challenge to illuminating the resilience of earth 's systems. there is now a growing realization that the manner in which communities will respond to anthropogenic impacts will ultimately control the ecosystem consequences. here, we examine the response of freshwater fishes and their nutrient excretion -a key ecosystem process that can control aquatic productivity -to human land development across the contiguous united states. by linking a continental-scale dataset of 533 fish species from 8100 stream locations with species functional traits, nutrient excretion, and land remote sensing, we present four key findings. first, we provide the first geographic footprint of nutrient excretion by freshwater fishes across the united states and reveal distinct local-and continental-scale heterogeneity in community excretion rates. second, fish species exhibited substantial response diversity in their sensitivity to land development; for native species, the more tolerant species were also the species contributing greater ecosystem function in terms of nutrient excretion. third, by modeling increased land-use change and resultant shifts in fish community composition, land development is estimated to decrease fish nutrient excretion in the majority (63%) of ecoregions. fourth, the loss of nutrient excretion would be 28% greater if biodiversity loss was random or 84% greater if there were no nonnative species. thus, ecosystem processes are sensitive to increased anthropogenic degradation but biotic communities provide multiple pathways for resistance and this resistance varies across space.
water_pollution	the disjunction of ecological and socioeconomic sciences is one of the main obstructions in current human-natural integrated systems research. therefore, gridded gis technology is introduced in an attempt to achieve the spatial flow analysis of water pollution in eco-natural systems. with this unified gis platform, an input-output table and one-dimensional water quality model are chosen to manifest the spatial economic flows and spatial natural flows of water pollution separately. finally, the comprehensive effect of the spatial circulation of water pollution in eco-natural systems is assessed. a case study of the framework is carried out in the changzhou district of taihu lake, china, and the main results show the following: (1) cod (chemical oxygen demand) direct emissions represent the characteristics of high intensity and clustering in industrial regions; control unit 8 is the largest secondary emissions unit, representing up to 41.79% of the total, whereas the emissions of the primary industry tend to be low intensity and widespread. (2) the gray virtual water flow from the primary industry to other heavy industries (except the chemical industry) is the main flow type; the transfer amount adds up to 2512 t, and the inter-units with the largest occupation of water environment capacity (wec) upstream to downstream are 8-9, nearly up to 1548 t. (3) under the interaction of positive and negative functions of economic flows and natural flows, the final effect of pollution transfer may be offset, environmental degradation or environmental improvement. this study could provide a basis for ecological compensation, environmental exteriority and optimization of industrial structure layouts.

rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting through modified contour ridges known as dead level contours has been practiced in zimbabwe in the last two decades. studies have shown marginal soil moisture retention benefits for using this technique while results on crop yield benefits are lacking. this paper presents results from a field study for assessing the impact of dead level contours on soil moisture and crop yield carried out from 2009 to 2011 within the limpopo river basin. the experiments were carried out on two study sites; one containing silt loam soil and another containing sandy soil. three treatments constituting dead level contoured plots, non-contoured plots and plots with the traditional graded contours were used on each site. all the three treatments were planted with a maize crop and managed using conventional farming methods. planting, weeding and fertiliser application in the three treatments were done at the same time. crop monitoring was carried out on sub plots measuring 4 m by 4 m established in every treatment. the development of the crop was monitored until harvesting time with data on plant height, leaf moisture and crop yield being collected. an analysis of the data shows that in the site with silt loam soil more soil moisture accumulated after heavy rainfall in dead level contour plots compared to the control (no contours) and graded contour plots (p0.05) higher yield in the dead level contoured treatment compared to the non-contoured treatment while a significantly (p0.05) higher than that from the non-contoured treatment. this suggests that adopting dead level contours as an in situ rainwater harvesting technique results in crop yield benefits in fields with soil type conditions that enable runoff generation but is not likely to have benefit in soils with low runoff generation.

smart_material	the technology monitoring the operating state of the architecture construction is always hot topics in civil engineering. in this paper, attempts using the nitisma film/ferroelectric ceramics pzt composite materials with the function of force - electricity conversion are introduced to the design of structural safety monitoring system. the sensing materials based on the function of force - electricity conversion, directly perceive the stress changes of architectural structure under the vibration loads, monitoring the state changes of internal cracks in the architectural structure. the results show that the safety monitoring system of architectural beam structure,on the sense of nitisma film / ferroelectric ceramics pzt composite materials, possesses reaction speed in milliseconds, response frequency at 0-1000 hz. it is suitable for monitoring the damage status of cracks in the architecture construction.
geotextile	in a wide spectrum of geotechnical applications, materials undergo large deformations and/ or large displacements. on modeling these problems with a lagrangian finite element method, the mesh can become too distorted and re-meshing is essential. in the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to adopt what is called meshfree methods to mitigate the problems related to mesh distortion. one of these methods is the material point method (mpm) that represents the continuum field as lagrangian material points (particles), which can move through the fixed background of an eulerian mesh. in this paper, the tensile membrane is modeled using the coupled fem-mpm approach which adopts two-dimensional triangular elements for the membrane discretisation which is free to move through a three-dimensional mesh of non-structured tetrahedral elements. apart from the membrane, the soil is treated with the classical procedure of mpm. to show the potential of the method and the presented membrane scheme, a failure of an embankment with and without geotextile has been presented in this paper. the analyses of failure mechanism and the embankment stability using undrained conditions were investigated to determine the critical embankment height and the corresponding geotextile forces. for the sake of comparison, plaxis 2d with large deformation formulation is considered as a reference solution.
rainwater_harvesting	combined sewer overflow (cso) infrastructure are conventionally designed based on historical climate data. yet, variability in rainfall intensities and patterns caused by climate change have a significant impact on the performance of an urban drainage system. although rainwater harvesting (rwh) is a potential solution to manage stormwater in urban areas, its benefits in mitigating the climate change impacts on combined sewer networks have not been assessed yet. hence, the goal of the present study was set to evaluate the effectiveness of rwh in alleviating the potential impacts of climate change on csos. to do so, first, future rainfall was achieved through the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (cmip5) based on modified historical record. then, rainfall-runoff modeling was employed using the u.s. epa stormwater management model (swmm) to study the response of cso outfalls to future rainfall. the study site was the combined sewer network of the city of toledo, ohio. results showed that under the maximum impact scenario in the near future, climate change might cause up to approximately 12-18% increase in csos occurrence, volume and duration in toledo. however, an rwh plan with the capacity of 0.76 m(3) (200 gal) implemented on half on the buildings throughout the area, appeared to be able to mitigate the potential future impacts, and showed a remarkable controlling performance in the peak flow periods. this plan also met toilet flushing demands. therefore, rwh can be considered as a feasible solution to mitigate future climate change impacts on csos and supply water demands.

water_pollution	there are more than a hundred textile industries in turkey that discharge large quantities of dye-rich wastewater, resulting in water pollution. such effluents must be treated to meet discharge limits imposed by the water framework directive in turkey. industrial treatment facilities must be required to monitor operations, keep them cost-effective, prevent operational faults, discharge-limit infringements, and water pollution. this paper proposes the treatment of actual textile wastewater by vertical flow constructed wetland (vfcw) systems operation and monitoring effluent wastewater quality using fuzzy logic with a graphical user interface. the treatment performance of vfcw is investigated in terms of chemical oxygen demand and ammonium nitrogen (nh4-n) content, color, and ph parameters during a 75-day period of operation. a computer program was developed with a fuzzy logic system (a decision- making tool) to graphically present (via a status analysis chart) the quality of treated textile effluent in relation to the turkish water pollution control regulation. fuzzy logic is used in the evaluation of data obtained from the vfcw systems and for notification of critical states exceeding the discharge limits. this creates a warning chart that reports any errors encountered in a reactor during the collection of any sample to the concerned party.
suspension_bridge	a novel system decoupling approach (sda) that enables three degree-of-freedom (3-dof) bridge flutter analysis is proposed in this study to simultaneously investigate the relationships between modal parameters and 18 flutter derivatives. based on the incentive-feedback mechanisms, the aerodynamic coupled system is conveniently decoupled in an iterative solution. based on the sda, it is unnecessary to simultaneously calculate all multiple frequencies for determining modal parameters and eventually quantifying critical flutter wind velocity. the efficacy and accuracy of the sda is verified using a numerical example of thin flat plate. the coupling effects among three dofs and influence of 18 flutter derivatives on flutter performance are quantified using the newly proposed method. the flutter mechanisms of thin flat plate and bluff deck section of the akashi kaikyo suspension bridge are numerically examined, and both difference and common grounds for two typical flutter phenomena are summarized. the results by the sda show good agreement with those by the commonly used complex eigen-value analysis (ceva). for the akashi kaikyo bridge with bluff deck section, the analytical results of 2-dof coupled flutter are coincident with the 3-dof case and the experimental observations. this study provides significant insights into the flutter characteristics of 3-dof bridges and explores the roles played by various parameters in modifying bridge deck aerodynamics and the evolution of modal coupling with increasing wind velocity. the simplified formulation that only concerns is presented, by which acceptable accuracy of flutter parameters can also be achieved for torsional modal branch. it is validated using a thin flat plate and the akashi kaikyo bridge with bluff deck.
green_building	green assessment tools such as the building research establishment environmental assessment method, leadership in energy and environmental design, comprehensive assessment system for building environmental efficiency, green star and hk-beam have been used worldwide. these tools, which utilise qualitative, credit-based rating system have several limitations. firstly, they can only provide a relative measure of the greenness of a facility. secondly, there is the possibility that the ratings assigned may differ from one user to another depending on the needs and priorities of an organisation, a country, or a region. several studies have also highlighted that such credit-based systems involve piece-meal (zuo and zhou in renew sustain energy rev 30:271-281, 2014), as opposed to integrated evaluation of the green criteria, and the greenness of a facility. this paper proposes a new green index (gi) as a tool for assessing the level of greenness of a facility that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. the use of stock market composite index as a basis for the gi development has enabled an established tool for assessing stock market performances to progress into the domain of industrial and commercial facility management. development of the gi involves two steps, namely the development of a weighting scheme using the factor analysis approach, followed by the composite gi formulation that is based on the stock market composite index. the developed green index is based on quantitative analysis and measurement of parameters, and hence, reflect the actual measure of the overall impact of a facility on the environment. with only a single indicator to represent multiple green elements, it makes it easier for facility managers to effectively and quantitatively monitor, analyse, compare and benchmark the actual level of greenness of facilities in new systems designs or a retrofit or conservation programme.
construction_management	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to present a maturity model developed to assess knowledge sharing (ks) for the jordanian construction sector. design/methodology/approach - the research was conducted in three stages. the first stage consisted of the review of literature and documenting variables from the literature that highlight influence on ks in organizations. the second stage was designed for maturity model development by identifying the cultural factors that affect ks in the jordanian construction sector through questionnaires and interviews. factor analysis was used to find possible relationships between the cultural variables followed by semi-structured interviews. in the third stage the initial maturity model was refined through another set of semi-structured interviews. findings - the model presented in the paper includes three levels of maturity. the first level identifies whether the variable barely exists in company 's ks practices. the second level shows the occasional techniques which the company uses to increase ks activities. the final level demonstrates the importance of the variable in affecting ks as being fundamentally ingrained in the company 's vision, mission, strategy and operations. originality/value - the research has developed a model that can be used to measure the ks in an organization. although the model has been applied to the construction industry, it can easily be modified to fit in the other sectors.
suspension_bridge	a comparison of the aeroelastic response of four 1:220 aeroelastic models representing three different construction stages and the completion stage of the izmit bay suspension bridge in turkey is presented. wind tunnel tests were performed in the same laboratory both in smooth and turbulent flow conditions to investigate the aeroelastic stability and the buffeting response. completion bridge results are used as a reference for considerations on how the variation of the structural characteristics and the different aerodynamics of the various construction stages influence the bridge stability and the buffeting response.

construction_management	purpose - in spite of the benefits of virtual models in the building and construction industry, the full potential of these models, especially in the construction and operation phases, remains largely unrealized. with the increasing developments in information and communication technology, a number of attempts have been made to extend the use of these models, through the development of integration approaches and technologies. however, the issue of integrating the virtual model and the physical construction such as to enable bi-directional coordination, has not been adequately addressed. thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of a cyber-physical systems (cps) approach in enhancing bi-directional coordination between virtual models and the physical construction. design/methodology/approach - this research employs scenario development rapid prototyping to illustrate cps integration in the construction industry, with a particular focus on facilitating bi-directional coordination. the proof-of-concept prototype systems developed were validated using a focus group consisting of industry practitioners. findings - bi-directional coordination between virtual models and the physical construction has the potential to improve real-time progress monitoring and control of the construction process, tracking of changes and model updates, information exchange between the design office and the job site, real-time documentation of the as-built status of high-value components and improved sustainability practices. originality/value - this paper adds value to the construction industry by demonstrating the application of the cps approach in enhancing bi-directional coordination between virtual models and the physical construction through the development of system architectures, scenarios and prototype systems.
green_building	in this study, waste tire powder and waste liquid crystal display (lcd) glass sand are used as recycled materials. with a fixed water to binder ratio (w/b = 0.4), the use of fly ash and slag as cement-replacement materials, waste tire powder and waste lcd glass sand, which passed the sieve screen size # 30(0.595 mm), were used to replace fine aggregates at 0%, 5% and 10% in producing lightweight aggregate concrete. the fresh property test was processed in accordance with aci concrete mix proportion design. harden and durability tests were performed at 7, 28, 56 and 91 days. the results showed that the slump increased or decreased with the addition of different types of recycled materials, but still met the design slump of 150-180 mm. concrete workability and the unit weight decreased after adding rubber powder to concrete. as the replacement rates of waste glass sand and waste rubber powder increase, the compressive strength tends to decrease. at 56 days, the ultrasonic wave velocity of normal concrete was higher than lightweight aggregate concrete; the lightweight aggregate concrete with 10% glass sand provided the highest ultrasonic wave velocity of the lightweight aggregate concretes. sulfate resistance tests showed that the normal weight aggregate concrete was better than the lightweight aggregate. mixing two kinds of recycled materials also resulted in better resistance. studies showed that adding an appropriate amount of recycled materials might improve the durability of lightweight aggregate concrete.

construction_management	the ability to accurately forecast a project 's final duration and cost is essential to successful project management. the technique of earned value management (evm) is considered to provide an effective methodology for obtaining such forecasts; however, this has not yet been adequately tested on empirical data. therefore, the accuracy of the most commonly used evm time and cost forecasting methods is evaluated on a diverse and qualitative database consisting of 51 real-life projects. as most projects originate from the construction industry, an explicit focus on these construction projects is provided. moreover, the desired real forecasting outcomes based on the actual project progress data are also supported by a monte carlo simulation study. it is demonstrated that highly accurate time and cost forecasts can be obtained by applying the evm methodology. furthermore, the best performing forecasting methods for the projects in the considered database are identified, also taking into account timeliness and the influence of the project network structure.

construction_management	purpose - current processes to manage changes are subject to failure since they are heavily dependent on human discipline. the purpose of this paper is to evaluate and quantify the difference between levels of automation of change management processes and to provide input for determining the use of automation systems for change management. design/methodology/approach - three generations of change management processes are defined to represent progressive practices used in major capital projects over the past few decades. discrete event simulation was used to model these processes to capture their behavior and compare their performance according to time and compliance metrics. an oil and gas megaproject served to validate the findings of this modeling and analysis. findings - the results showed that automated processes can bring more compliance and real-time traceability, but not a significant time reduction in the change process. this contributes to the understanding of the impact of workflow-based automation on construction process performance. the validity of the conclusions are limited by the breadth of sectors studied and the inability to capture off-line time allocations of the personnel involved. future research may build on the work presented here by studying additional processes such as requests for information, project change notices, requests for scaffolding, and interface management in various industry sectors. originality/value - a new approach for modeling and evaluating construction management process automation is contributed and the specific results of the paper indicate that automated workflow-based change management processes should be implemented in megaprojects.
geotextile	the aim of this work is to study the effect of a localized impact on a wall made of soil reinforced with geocells. first, two structures were tested with an impacting remote-controlled car. such experiments, carried out on 1/10th-scale model structures for practical reasons, are designed to mimic the mechanical response of an alveolar geocell reinforcement system. two types of constitutive materials were considered for the geocells with very different mechanical properties. the test structures were dismantled after the tests to analyse the influence of the impact on the cell layers, especially within their bulk. examining the video of the tests captured with two high-speed cameras also helped understanding the phenomena that occurred during impact. these experiments were completed by numerical simulations whose objective was to understand more clearly the causes of the phenomena observed either within the dismantled structures or in the videos.

remote_sensing	hydrological investigation and behavior of watershed depend upon geo-morphometric characteristics of catchment. morphometric analysis is commonly used for development of regional hydrological model of ungauged watershed. a critical valuation and assessment of geomorphometric constraints has been carried out. prioritization of watersheds based on water plot capacity of piperiya watershed has been evaluated by linear, aerial and relief aspects. morphometric analysis has been attempted for prioritization for nine sub-watersheds of piperiya watershed in hasdeo river basin, which is a tributary of the mahanadi. sub-watersheds are delineated by arcmap 9.3 software as per digital elevation model (dem). assessment of drainages and their relative parameters such as stream order, stream length, stream frequency, drainage density, texture ratio, form factor, circulatory ratio, elongation ratio, bifurcation ratio and compactness ratio has been calculated separately for each sub-watershed using the remote sensing (rs) and geospatial techniques. finally, the prioritized score on the basis of morphometric behavior of each sub-watershed is assigned and thereafter consolidated scores have been estimated to identify the most sensitive parameters. the analysis reveals that stream order varies from 1 to 5; however, the first-order stream covers maximum area of about 87.7 %. total number of stream segment of all order is 1,264 in the watershed. the study emphasizes the prioritization of the sub-watersheds on the basis of morphometric analysis. the final score of entire nine sub-watersheds is assigned as per erosion threat. the sub-watershed with the least compound parameter value was assigned as highest priority. however, the sub-watersheds has been categorized into three classes as high (4.1-4.7), medium (4.8-5.3) and low (>5.4) priority on the basis of their maximum (6.0) and minimum (4.1) prioritized score.
rainwater_harvesting	the ethiopian government has been working on rainwater harvesting (rwh) for more than three decades. despite its efforts, the results are not as expected. different barriers have posed challenges to promoting rwh in ethiopia. this study was done to identify the main problems and obstacles, and reflect on potential solutions. as a result, absence of clear policy definitions, lack of sustainably implemented projects, poor societal perceptions of rwh, local professionals lacking proper knowledge, and initial investment costs are found to be major causes of poor outcomes. considering the site-specific nature of water issues, the authors propose various management strategies such as policy-oriented promotion, formulation of design guidelines, proactive planning, collaborative research, and integration of rwh with cost covering practices.
construction_management	building information modelling (bim) represents a long-term investment that could allow time reduction and a cost enhancement by means of optimised design and construction processes. the paper focuses on the first official italian public pilot project, dealing with the implementation of bim-based validation and construction optimisation in a construction process. the case study concerns a residential building located in a dense urban district, causing a confined construction site affected by space shortage and coordination issues. the research aims to implement an interoperable ifc-based process in order to support the design and construction phases, performing advanced model and code checking and analysing the construction phase through 4d bim. architectural, structural, and mep models have been enriched with alphanumeric attributes as required by semi-automatic validation processes. an auto-matching between bim objects and construction activities was also achieved. the early results showed the possibility of a bim-based semi-automatic validation of design choices and an improved coordination between design disciplines. moreover, the construction site simulation allowed the comparison of different layout options and baseline schedules. the research also tested the joint use of model checking and 4d bim tools in order to analyse construction progresses by exporting an ifc-based construction site configuration directly from the 4d bim tool. the tested process created an open, interoperable, and multi-disciplinary approach. the main findings concerning the domestic special constraints are described and analysed.

rainwater_harvesting	in this study, a methodology is presented and demonstrated for combined estimation of regional specific yield and distributed recharge using double water-table fluctuation (dwtf) technique and geographical information system (gis) in a hard-rock aquifer system of semi-arid regions. the study area was divided into 25 zones and groundwater budget components were computed for both wet and dry seasons using 11-year period (1996-2006) data. in each zone, the regional specific yield was estimated by applying the wtf technique for dry seasons and the rainfall recharge was estimated by applying the wtf technique for wet seasons. zone-wise rainfall recharge relationships were established using regression technique. thereafter, the specific yield and recharge estimates were used with gis to generate their maps. surface-water bodies were found to significantly contribute to groundwater recharge. this finding underscores the need for adopting rainwater harvesting in the study area to enhance recharge. the regional specific yields were found to range from 0.038 to 0.002, whereas the mean rainfall recharge was found to vary from 0.5 to 10.9 cm. the box whisker plots of z-scale transformed specific yield revealed the greatest spatial variation. the spatial and temporal variations of the rainfall recharge in the study area are statistically significant (p30%). the developed rainfall recharge relationships were found to be 'highly significant' (r(2) >= 0.54,pr(2) >= 0.36,p < 0.01) in ten zones and 'insignificant' (r(2) < 0.36) in the remaining zones.

green_building	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to explore innovation adoption theory and to define a model to investigate operational activities and communication in innovation networks that can stimulate both supply and demand. it also aims to exemplify this model with the activities of an innovation network dedicated to promoting passive houses. design/methodology/approach - autoethnography and literature research were used to develop a model in order to conduct a structured analysis of operational activities and facilitate innovation-decision processes using networks. data on the activities used to steer client decisions and businesses' innovation were gathered from network archives and from the results of social research methods applied within a passive house network. findings - the findings reveal that operational activities of multiplayer networks should focus on reinforcing conditions and communicative activities that support innovation-decision processes from one step to the next. in order to activate supply and demand, communication strategies can be modelled to increase the adoption of innovation and continued knowledge generation in networks. research limitations/implications - because only one network was evaluated and only the housing sector was exemplified, it may not be possible to generalise the research results. researchers are therefore encouraged to test the proposed model further. practical implications -the paper includes the implications of developing activities in innovation networks, in order to guide both businesses and customers through the steps of the adoption-decision process. social implications -the paper provides insights regarding the uptake of innovation in the construction sector, beyond demonstration projects. originality/value - this paper connects the innovation adoption to activities of a network in the field of construction.
smart_material	this study presents the fabrication and characterization of novel bactericidal nanoceria doped composite nanofibers. nanoceria doped composite nanofibers fabricated by physically blending polyurethane (pu) with two biopolymers such as cellulose acetate (ca) and zein. the nanoceria were prepared by electrospinning of a sol gel composed of cerium nitrate hexahydrate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone and followed by calcination and sonication. the physicochemical characterizations of the synthesized nanoceria doped composite nanofibers were carried out by x-ray diffraction pattern, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. the antibacterial activity was tested against most common pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia colt, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica (gram-negative), staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis (gram-positive). the nanoceria doped composite nanofibers have demonstrated effective toxicity against both the gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains. the obtained results indicate that the inhibition is dependent on the concentration of nanoceria doped composite nanofibers. tem analysis reveals that nanoceria caused disruption of cell membranes which led to the irreversible damage to the cell envelope eventually leading to cell death. generally, these nanoceria doped composite nanofibers were depicted as a promising nanomaterial for exceptional antibacterial treatment and can be used as another smart material for biomedical and industrial applications.

suspension_bridge	this study developed an artificial filter bank (afb) that emulates the auditory system in order to efficiently obtain the significant dynamic responses. the developed afb is composed of digitally coded band-pass filter optimizing algorithm (boa) and peak picking algorithm (ppa). the developed afb was then optimized using the random el-centro earthquake wave, which is often used in structural dynamic studies, and the reconstructed signal and compressed signal were compared to the original signal using the reconstruction error (re) and compressive ratio (cr). the afb developed, designed, and evaluated in this study adequately captures the time and frequency information of the original signal while capturing the significant dynamic response compressed about the frequency range of interest. also the digitally developed afb overcomes the shortcomings of conventional analog filter banks, supporting for quick and easy software-based implementation of new logics, optimizations, and designs. ultimately the afb developed in this study is expected to provide new paradigm in the structural health monitoring of construction structures as well as other structures.

construction_management	during the economic crisis in 2007 forced the entrepreneurs of the real estate sector and construction sector and industry as a whole cleansed, educated and development, to think about their actions development, to survive and future perspectives of the development. can be considered, therefore, that similar to the elsewhere in europe and the world, and in latvia appeared in these sectors new concepts - sustainable construction, low energy buildings, green construction, passive house, lean construction and other sustainability-related concepts. creating high-quality, environmentally friendly and healthy everyday living and working space is provided economic, ecological and social sustainability in the future, which brings significant benefits of any country, including economy, environment and society in latvia.
solar_energy	since photovoltaic (pv) generators have no mechanical inertia, fast solar irradiance changes associated with cloud transients cause instantaneous variations in pv power output, resulting in rapid and possibly significant voltage changes in systems with high penetration of pv generators. in addition to characterizing this emerging power-quality issue, this paper proposes and investigates techniques to mitigate these fast voltage variations caused by cloud transients in distribution system with pv solar farms. the investigated approaches are based on the pv inverter capacity for fast reactive power compensation without the need to oversize the inverter or curtail the active power by using only the available reserve. real measurement data characterize the issue and time-series power-flow simulations evaluate the mitigation techniques.
ambient_intelligence	this paper describes an approach to assess and measure trust based on a specific ambient intelligence environment. the primary aim of this work is to address and expand on this line of research by investigating the possibility of measuring trust based on quantifiable behavior. to do so, we present a brief review of the existing definitions of trust and define trust in the context of an ambient intelligence (ami) scenario. further, we propose a formal definition so that the analysis of trust in this kind of scenarios can be developed. thus, it is suggested the use of ambient intelligence techniques that use a trust data model to collect and evaluate relevant information based on the assumption that observable trust between two entities (parties) results in certain typical behaviors. this will establish the foundation for the prediction of such aspects based on the analysis of people 's interaction with technological environments, providing new potentially interesting trust assessment tools.
smart_material	the use of cement based composites as strain sensors have been studied by different researchers. the effect of ""cross talk for which the strain is perpendicular to electric current in the cement based composite, is an important issue for using the cement based material as a strain sensor. in this study, steel fiber reinforced cement matrix composite was tested with two different compression tests, at which compressive strain and electric current were parallel or perpendicular. the ""cross talk compression test"" at which electric current and compressive strain was perpendicular has been conducted for the first time in this study. also, split tensile tests at which tensile strain and electric current were parallel or perpendicular were applied for the first time in this study. the cross gage factors were higher than the gage factors which were explained by mechanisms on variations of electron transfer cross sections. strong linear relationships between the perpendicular compressive strain-electrical resistance change (%r) and perpendicular tensile strain-electrical resistance change (%r) were obtained. these strong linear relationships can be used to decompose the effects of ""cross talk"" in cement based sensor applications.

ambient_intelligence	ambient intelligence (ami) provides a vision of the information society where heterogeneous hardware entities are disseminated in the environment and used by intelligent agents to provide ubiquitous applications. to ease the integration of new entities in the system, the application and the underlying hardware infrastructure have to be decorrelated. the aim of our research work is to propose mechanisms for the deployment, automatic configuration and monitoring of applications on an heterogeneous hardware infrastructure. in this paper, we model ambient systems to fulfill this purpose. we propose a graph-based mathematical model for ambient systems. this model allows to use a projection algorithm, extending an existing graph matching algorithm, for the deployment and the automatic configuration of applications on an heterogeneous hardware infrastructure.

solar_energy	in this study, ni-doped iron oxide (nixfe3-xo4) materials were synthesized via the 1,2-epoxypropane assisted sol-gel method by varying the molar concentration of ni from x=0.2 to 1. sol-gel derived nixfe3-xo4 gels were dried and the dried powder was further calcined upto 600 degrees c in air for 90 min. obtained calcined nixfe3-xo4 powders were further analyzed to determine the phase composition, crystallite size, specific surface area, pore volume, and morphology via powder x-ray diffraction (pxrd), bet surface area analysis (bet), as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy (sem and tem). the obtained results in the synthesis and characterization section indicate formation of nixfe3-xo4 nanoparticles with high specific surface area. thermal reduction and re-oxidation of the sol-gel synthesized nixfe3-xo4 materials were determined by using the high temperature thermogravimetry. obtained results indicate that the amount of o-2 released during the thermal reduction step (at 1400 degrees c) and quantity of co produced during the co2 splitting step (at 1000 degrees c) increases as the concentration of ni inside the iron oxide crystal structure increases. the highest amounts of o-2 released (221.88 mu mol/g) and co produced (375.01 mu mol/g) in case of nife2o4 (nf10 material).
suspension_bridge	this research discusses recent developments and applications of a high-strength prefabricated parallel wire strand (ppws) with a tensile strength of 1960 mpa. the cost efficiency of high-strength ppws cables is briefly reviewed. performance requirements of the newly developed wire and ppws cable are proposed by referring to the existing specifications and building codes. acceptance tests were performed on wire and ppws cable specimens. the results confirmed that the ppws cables have sufficient strength to be used as the main cables of the ulsan harbor bridge, a long-span suspension bridge currently under construction in korea. a mass production system for the ppws cable, recently implemented in korea, is outlined by describing notable aspects of the equipment and manufacturing process. we believe that the high-strength ppws, combined with the efficient mass production system described in this study can provide a more economical solution for the aspects concerning the main cables of long-span suspension bridges.
green_building	recently green buildings are booming rapidly in china. in order to improve the performance of green buildings, energy consumption in 31 and indoor environment quality(ieq) in 10 green office buildings are compared with common ones through energy data collection, physical parameters measurement and satisfaction survey. the results indicate that for building type a (mix-mode), it is only in hot-summer cold-winter zone that green buildings' energy consumption is statistically significantly less than common buildings. for type b (mechanically conditioned), no statistically significantly difference between green and common has been observed in all climate zones. it is also found that in hot-summer cold-winter zone the average energy consumption of type a and b are 15% and 23% lower than the upper-limit values required by the chinese standard [27]. however in other climate zones, they are above the upper limit. in terms of the ieq and building service performance, the satisfaction of users in green is marked higher than that in common in the field of thermal comfort, indoor air quality(iaq), facilities, operating & maintenance. in addition, factors affecting buildings' energy consumption are analyzed in order to provide guidance for further enhancing the performance of green buildings in design and operation stages.

suspension_bridge	the design of cable supported bridge with long span is challenging due to the sensitivity of the dynamic excitation. the aerodynamic instability caused by fluttering can severely affect the safe operation. an application of indicial function to the flutter analysis in time domain is applied to the great belt east bridge for both completed and erection stage. the nonlinear least square method was used to extract the aerodynamic indicial parameters for flutter analysis in time domain. the geometric nonlinearity is considered through the nonlinear dynamic analysis. the results showed the good agreement with the wind tunnel test and the validity of the indicial function as well as the important role of the geometrically nonlinear analysis during deck erection.
rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting, consisting in collecting runoff from precipitation, has been widely developed to stop groundwater declines and even raise water tables. however, this expected environmental effect is not self-evident. we show in a simple setting that the success of this conjunctive use depends on whether the runoff rate is above a threshold value. moreover, the bigger the storage capacity, the higher the runoff rate must be to obtain an environmentally efficient system. we also extend the model to include other hydrological parameters and ecological damages, which respectively increase and decrease the environmental efficiency of rainwater harvesting.
smart_material	this paper deals with a solution to rectify the problem of corrosion in steel girder bridges. the problem arises due to electrochemical reactions occurring inside the structure on the surface of the steel. these reactions result in oxidizing the steel and eventually corroding it. for controlling such problem a mechanism is developed using de current parallel wire system. this mechanism is based on parallel connection circuit principle i.e. current always uses the path with low resistivity and it is also emphasized to use smart material to produce dc current to be supplied in parallel wire system. how to install and design the parallel wire system to control corrosion is illustrated in this paper. this mechanism can be used in various types of steel structures like bridges, and results in increased reliability and durability of such structures.
ambient_intelligence	this paper presents a monitor assistant system for detection of dangerous events and health diagnostics for patients with dementia. the proposed framework brings together three different types of ambient intelligence: (i) sensors for detecting life-threatening events that can occur at home, like falls and anomalies in vital signs predicting risk of myocardial infarction; (ii) sensors placed under bed-posts for detecting unhealthy poor movement while patients are lying on the bed which can cause bedsores (decubitus); and (iii) analysis of the current cognitive state of patients with dementia by means of serious computer games. this paper presents the framework, methods and sensors used by our system to assist patients with dementia by triggering different type of alarm signals informing which patient needs what and how some help could be provided.
suspension_bridge	obvious vortex induced vibration (viv) was observed during section model wind tunnel tests for a single main cable suspension bridge. an optimized section configuration was found for mitigating excessive amplitude of vibration which is much larger than the one prescribed by chinese code. in order to verify the maximum amplitude of viv for optimized girder, a full bridge aeroelastic model wind tunnel test was carried out. the differences between section and full aeroelastic model testing results were discussed. the maximum amplitude derived from section model tests was first interpreted into prototype with a linear viv approach by considering partial or imperfect correlation of vortex-induced aerodynamic force along span based on scanlan 's semi-empirical linear model. a good consistency between section model and full bridge model was found only by considering the correlation of vortex-induced force along span.
suspension_bridge	systems of parallel beams connected with springs appear often in engineering. typical examples are bundles of wires, such as the ones appearing in suspension bridge cables. these connections result in coupling of the differential equations describing the problem. in this paper, two systems of parallel beams connected with springs perpendicular to the beams are examined: multiple beams connected with springs, and multiple beams of common stiffness connected with springs and subjected to a common tensile axial load. a method is proposed to decouple the system of coupled equations into uncoupled differential equations for which exact shape functions can be constructed, so that the computational effort associated with systems involving a very large number of beams can become manageable. numerical examples are presented demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed method.
construction_management	in response to the call for sustainability education in construction courses, higher education institutions have started to incorporate sustainability components into their construction courses to some extent. this research aims to investigate sustainability embedded in construction management (cm) courses using the queensland university of technology as a case study. a content analysis of its cm course structure, unit aims, learning objectives and lecture materials is conducted to examine the sustainability elements incorporated into the cm curriculum. the results show that the course incorporates sustainability components into the existing course structure mainly through horizontal integration, embedding sustainability into general units rather than as an add-on subject. additionally, the sustainability topics embedded in the course cover a comparatively broad and balanced range of sustainability categories, i.e. background knowledge, policies and regulations, environmental issues, social issues and economic issues as well as technology and innovation, although social sustainability aspects need to be further strengthened. this research addresses the need for urgency in the development of an effective sustainability education framework for construction courses. it is expected that the findings from this study will facilitate the improvement of sustainability education in construction courses generally.

remote_sensing	since 1990, yahtse glacier in southern alaska has advanced at an average rate of similar to 100 m year(-1) despite a negative mass balance, widespread thinning in its accumulation area, and a low accumulation-area ratio. to better understand the interannual and seasonal changes at yahtse and the processes driving these changes, we construct velocity and ice surface elevation time series spanning the years 1985-2016 and 2000-2014, respectively, using satellite optical and synthetic aperture radar (sar) observations. we find contrasting seasonal dynamics above and below a steep (up to 35% slope) icefall located approximately 6 km from the terminus. above the icefall, velocities peak in may and reach their minima in october synchronous with the development of a small embayment at the calving terminus. the up-glacier minimum speeds, embayment, and plume of turbid water that emerges from the embayment are consistent with an efficient, channelized subglacial drainage system that lowers basal water pressures and leads to focused submarine melt in the calving embayment. however, velocities near the terminus are fastest in the winter, following terminus retreat, possibly off of a terminal moraine that results in decreased backstress. between 1996 and 2016 the terminus decelerated by similar to 40% at an average rate of similar to 0.4 m day(-1) year(-1), transitioned from tensile to compressive longitudinal strain rates, and dynamically thickened at rates of 1-6 m year(-1), which we hypothesize is in response to the development and advance of a terminal moraine. the described interannual changes decay significantly upstream of the icefall, indicating that the icefall may inhibit the upstream transmission of stress perturbations. we suggest that diminished stress transmission across the icefall could allow moraine-enabled terminus advance despite mass loss in yahtse 's upper basin. our work highlights the importance of glacier geometry in controlling tidewater glacier re-advance, particularly in a climate favoring increasing equilibrium line altitudes.
remote_sensing	the purpose of this paper is to analyze how different definitions and methods for delineating the spatial boundaries of cities have an impact on the values of city sustainability indicators. it is necessary to distinguish the inside of cities fromt he outside when calculating the values of sustainability indicators that assess the impacts of human activities within cities on areas beyond their boundaries. for this purpose, spatial boundaries of cities should be practically detected on the basis of a relevant definition of a city. although no definition of a city is commonly shared among academic fields, three practical methods for identifying urban areas are available in remote sensing science. those practical methods are based on population density, landcover, and night-time lights. these methods are correlated, but non-negligible differences exist in their determination of urban extents and urban population. furthermore, critical and statistically significant differences in some urban environmental sustainability indicators result from the three different urban detection methods. for example, the average values of co2 emissions per capita and pm10 concentration in citieswithmore than 1 million residents are significantly different among the definitions. when analyzing city sustainability indicators and disseminating the implication of the results, the values based on the different definitions should be simultaneously investigated. it is necessary to carefully choose a relevant definition to analyze sustainability indicators for policymaking. otherwise, ineffective and inefficient policies will be developed.

remote_sensing	rapid urbanization dramatically changes the local environment. a hybrid classification method is designed and applied to multi-temporal landsat images and ancillary data to obtain land cover change datasets. a support vector machine (svm) classifier is used to classify multi-temporal landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (etm+) images that were collected in 2000 at the pixel level. these images are also segmented with the mean shift method. the impervious surface is refined based on a combination of the segmented objects and the svm classification results. the changed areas in 1990 and 2010 are determined by comparing the thematic mapper (tm) and etm+ images via the re-weighted multivariate alteration detection transformation method. the tm images that were masked as changed areas in 1990 and 2000 are input into the svm classifier. land cover maps for 1990 and 2010 are produced by combining the unchanged area in 2000 with the new classes of the changed areas in 1990 and 2010. land cover change has continuously accelerated since 1990. remarkably, arable land decreased, while the impervious surface area significantly increased.
stealth_technology	a perfect multiband metamaterial absorber based on triple hexagonal shaped resonators has proposed in this paper. this absorber possesses a nearly wide angle perfect absorption of incidence wave and represents polarization independence. the absorption is occurred in three different frequencies. the absorptivity is as high as 94%, 95% and 99%, at 3.4(ghz), 4.6(ghz) and 6.4(ghz), respectively. the proposed metamaterial absorber has wide applications such as stealth technology, thermal detector and imaging. moreover, a very good agreement between simulation and measurement results has been observed.
remote_sensing	analyzing retrieval accuracy and precision is an important element of space-based co2 retrievals. however, this error analysis is sometimes challenging to perform rigorously because of the subtlety of multivariate statistics. to help address this issue, we revisit some fundamentals of multivariate statistics that help reveal the statistical essence of the associated error analysis. we show that the related statistical methodology is useful for revealing the intrinsic discrepancy and relation between the retrieval error for a nonzero-variate co2 state and that for a zero-variate one. our study suggests that the two scenarios essentially yield the same-magnitude accuracy, while the latter scenario yields a better precision than the former. we also use this methodology to obtain a rigorous framework systematically and explore a broadly used approximate framework for analyzing co2 retrieval errors. the approximate framework introduces errors due to an essential, but often forgotten, fact that a priori climatology in reality is never equal to the true state. due to the nature of the problem considered, realistic numerical simulations that produce synthetic spectra may be more appropriate than remote sensing data for our specific exploration. as highlighted in our retrieval simulations, utilizing the approximate framework may not be universally satisfactory in assessing the accuracy and precision of xco(2) retrievals (with errors up to 0.17-0.28ppm and 1.4-1.7ppm, respectively, at snr=400). in situ measurements of co2 are needed to further our understanding of this issue and related implications.
ambient_intelligence	the ambient intelligence (ami) technologies have the potential to create intelligent environments with new generation of assistive services, enhanced with ubiquitous robots. these environments have the ability to be anticipatory, responsive and intelligent providers of assistive services anytime and anywhere. these services can assist frail persons effectively in their daily tasks. one of the main challenging research problems in assistive robotics is to endow ubiquitous robots with ability to pro-actively taking on some tasks to help humans in performing complex activities, by participating with them just as other humans do, in normal societies or organizations. in this paper, we propose a collective intelligence framework based on narrative reasoning and natural language processing. in the proposed approach, we propose a hybrid model that bridges together the narrative knowledge representation language (nkrl), from natural language processing field, and the harms (humans, software agents, robots, machines and sensors) model, from multi-agent systems engineering field. this model is able to (i) drive the dialogues between humans, robots and smart devices, (ii) understand a complex situation, and (iii) trigger reactive actions, in the ubiquitous environment, according to given contexts. two scenarios dedicated to the assistance of a frail person in a smart home equipped with a companion robot and smart objects are implemented and discussed for validation purposes of the proposed framework.

remote_sensing	the atmospheric effects that influence on the signal registered by remote sensors might be minimized in order to provide reliable spectral information. in aquatic systems, the application of atmospheric correction aims to minimize such effects and avoid the under or overestimation of remote sensing reflectance (r-rs). accurately r-rs provides better information about the state of aquatic system, it means, establishing the concentration of aquatic compounds more precisely. the aim of this study is to evaluate the outputs from several atmospheric correction methods (dark object subtraction dos; quick atmospheric correction - quac; fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes - flaash; atmospheric correction for oli 'lite' - acolite, and provisional landsat-8 surface reflectance algorithm - l8sr) in order to investigate the suitability of r-rs for estimating total suspended matter concentrations (tsm) in the barra bonita hydroelectrical reservoir. to establish tsm concentrations via atmospherically corrected operational land imager (oli) scene, the tsm retrieval model was calibrated and validated with in situ data. thereby, the achieved results from tsm retrieval model application demonstrated that l8sr is able to provide the most suitable r-rs values for green and red spectral bands, and consequently, the lowest tsm retrieval errors (mean absolute percentage error about 10% and 12%, respectively). retrieved r-rs from near infrared band is still a challenge for all the tested algorithms.

green_building	building construction is one of the largest final consumers of environmental resources as well as one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas and other pollution. this paper aims to propose ecological indicators for green building construction by applying a slack-based data envelop analysis approach, in which resource conservation and environmental protection are both incorporated. we conduct an empirical analysis of ecological indicators for green building construction using china 's regional panel dataset during 1995-2012, and use the analysis to further discuss the technological gaps across the regions. the findings show that: (i) half of china 's provinces have a substantial potential increase of more than 60% in ecological performance for green building construction; (ii) the developed areas perform better than the developing areas; (iii) the 11th five-year plan period is a turning point for china 's green building construction and development as the policies for green construction haye significant effects.

solar_energy	in the present work the use of a sequence of two solar photocatalytic processes was investigated for the removal of copper, iron, zinc and ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (edds), used as chelating agent, from real soil washing effluents. removal efficiencies of 93.5% (copper), 99.6% (iron), 99.4% (zinc), 97.2% (edds) and 80.7% (toc) were achieved through outdoor solar photocatalytic treatments using parabolic trough collectors and carried out in naples (italy, n 40 degrees 50', e 14 degrees 12') in the period june-july 2015. these removal efficiencies were achieved for an incident uva solar energy per unit volume (q(j,n)) of 580 kj.l-1 calculated by taking into account the irradiated surface area of the photoreactor estimated in the present work (9.79 x 10(-2) m(2)) and the solar irradiance measurements collected during the experiments. the results suggest that the two-step solar process adopted can be proposed as a useful solution to the problem of heavy metals and chelating organic agents removals from soil washing. the ecotoxicological assessment, using different living organisms (daphnia magna, vibrio fischeri, pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, lepidium sativum and caenorhabditis elegans), showed a noticeable decrease of the ecotoxicity of the soil washing effluents after the two-step photocatalytic process.

green_building	a novel transparent roof which is made of solid cpc (compound parabolic concentrator) pv/t/d (photovoltaic/thermal/day lighting) system is presented. it combines the solar pv/t/d system with green building design. the pv/t/d system can achieve excellent light control at noon and adjust the thermal environment in the building, such that high efficiency utilization of solar energy could be achieved in modern architecture. this kind of roof can increase the visual comfort for building occupants; it can also avoid the building interior from overheating and dazzling at noon which is caused by direct sunlight through transparent roof. optical simulation software is used to track the light path in different incidence angles. cfd (computational fluid dynamics) simulation and steady state experiment have been taken to investigate the thermal characteristic of pv/t/d device. finally, the pv/t/d experimental system was built; and the pv efficiency, light transmittance and air heating power of the system are tested under real sky conditions.

rainwater_harvesting	low-impact development (lid) technologies, such as bioretention areas, rooftop rainwater harvesting, and xeriscaping can control stormwater runoff, supply non-potable water, and landscape open space. this study examines a hybrid system (hs) that combines lid technologies with a centralized water system to lessen the burden on a conventional system (cs). cs is defined as the stormwater collection and water supply infrastructure, and the conventional landscaping choices in the city of atlanta. the study scope is limited to five single-family residential zones (sfzs), classified r-1 through r-5, and four multi-family residential zones (mfzs), classified rg-2 through rg-5. population density increases from 0.4 (r-1) to 62.2 (rg-5) persons per 1,000 m(2). we performed a life cycle assessment (lca) comparison of cs and hs using traci 2.1 to simulate impacts on the ecosystem, human health, and natural resources. we quantified the impact of freshwater consumption using the freshwater ecosystem impact (fei) indicator. test results indicate that hs has a higher lca single score than cs in zones with a low population density; however, the difference becomes negligible as population density increases. incorporating lid in sfzs and mfzs can reduce potable water use by an average of 50% and 25%, respectively; however, water savings are negligible in zones with high population density (i.e., rg-5) due to the diminished surface area per capita available for lid technologies. the results demonstrate that lid technologies effectively reduce outdoor water demand and therefore would be a good choice to decrease the water consumption impact in the city of atlanta.

solar_energy	in recent years, the challenges of environmental issues, sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, increasing energy demand, decreasing the profitability of fossil fuels extracted from readily available reservoirs, shale formations and tight sands, and unsteady and unpredictable energy prices have forced oil-producing countries to turn their attention to renewable energies. most of these countries are located on the world 's solar belt and have an excellent solar availability with an average of 300-320 days of bright sunshine throughout a year. there is, as a result, growing attention to solar energy and especially to the photovoltaics (pvs). therefore, a tremendous progress is witnessed in technology as well as economy through the blooming of new markets in the past few decades. the considerable progress in the application of pvs in oil-producing countries is closely dependent upon the development of suitable policies and strategies due to the existence of high electricity subsidies and low tariffs of the governments. in this context, this paper aims to pursue the current progress in pvs in major oil-producing countries located around the persian gulf and to discuss the recent advances in the prospective policy of iran, as a case study. the obtained results show that a minimum of 20% increase in annual electricity rate would guarantee benefit from investments in the pvs power plants under the current economic situation of iran. subsequently, this study investigates the optimal approaches for the development of the application of pvs in oil-producing countries.
solar_energy	a new class of the all electric airship to globally transport both passengers and freight using a 'feeder-cruiser' concept, and powered by renewable electric energy, is considered. specific focus is given to photo-electric harvesting as the primary energy source and the associated hydrogen-based energy storage systems. furthermore, it is shown that the total pv output may be significantly increased by utilising cloud albedo effects. appropriate power architectures and energy audits required for life support, and the propulsion and ancillary loads to support the continuous daily operation of the primary airship (cruiser) at stratospheric altitudes (circa 18 km), are also considered. the presented solution is substantially different from those of conventional aircraft due to the airship size and the inherent requirement to harvest and store sufficient energy during ""daylight"" operation, when subject to varying seasonal conditions and latitudes, to ensure its safe and continued operation during the corresponding varying ""dark hours"". this is particularly apparent when the sizing of the proposed electrolyser is considered, as its size and mass increase nonlinearly with decreasing day-night duty. as such, a unitized regenerative fuel cell is proposed. for the first time the study also discusses the potential benefits of integrating the photo-voltaic cells into airship canopy structures utilising tensairity (r)-based elements in order to eliminate the requirements for separate inter-pv array wiring and the transport of low pressure hydrogen between fuel cells.
green_building	leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) is a widely used international green building certification program developed by the u.s. green building council (usgbc). although the need for leed certification has grown significantly, leed managers still face challenges in target credit selection and green building technology design. they frequently meet new types of projects with different project characteristics and requirements. therefore, it would be helpful if leed managers could refer to other similar certified green building cases when planning and designing leed projects. however, this is not supported in current studies and research. this paper proposes a case-based reasoning (cbr) approach to provide case studies of similar certified green building projects and suggestions on target leed credits. currently, linear formation of local-global method is commonly used in the retrieval step of cbr. this paper presents a non-linear formation of local-global retrieval based on artificial neural network (ann), which can provide a higher accuracy. leed for new construction (leed-nc) is the focus of this paper, and 1000 leed-nc v2009 certified cases were collected for the case base. pairwise comparison was conducted to generate the local distance (attribute similarity) and the target for training the ann model. the proposed non-linear cbr approach was tested and evaluated using 20 recently certified projects, and the results showed a prediction accuracy of 80.75% on the leed credit selection. the results were also compared with those calculated by commonly used linear cbr approaches: multiple regression analysis, correlation analysis, and the k-nn approach. the accuracy achieved by these methods was between 71.23% and 77.54%, which was lower than the proposed approach.

construction_management	in the field of construction, indoor localization of mobile construction resources remains a universal challenge. although discussions have focused on the tracking accuracy and affordability of indoor localization technologies, few efforts have focused on practical criteria such as ease of use, latency, and data visualization and remote sharing. to close this gap in knowledge, this study introduces a building information modeling (bim) and cloud-enabled radio-frequency identification (rfid) localization system. the system consists of three main components: the passive rfid localization system, the bim visualization system, and the cloud computing system. the proposed system is tested in a full-scale implementation on an actual construction site. the test was designed and conducted to evaluate the localization accuracy, data latency, and real-time data processing and visualization for remote monitoring. a comprehensive analysis is made of various practical issues based on the test results and panel discussion. the findings in this study indicate that the bim and cloud-enable rfid indoor localization solution has a great potential in practical applications such as site security control, safety management, asset management, and productivity monitoring.
water_pollution	the river ganga is the largest, perennial and one of the sacred rivers in india. it supports the lifeline of major population in urban and rural areas existing in the river basin. the river is a chief source of water supply, power generation, river-borne transport and expansion of the urban industrial belt. however, the river receives huge amount of untreated wastewater which imbalances the nutrient concentration at many points along the stretch. therefore, the present study is focused to estimate the water pollution using water quality indices, such as opi, national sanitation foundation index (nsfwqi), comprehensive pollution index (cpi) and heavy metal pollution index (hpi), and identify the imbalance nutrients (i. e. no3, po4, heavy metals, etc.) in the river. also, the probability of health risk that might occur by drinking the river water has been classified using risk assessment index (rai). the water samples were collected in post-and pre-monsoon months in year 2014-2015, from nine sampling locations between haridwar and garhmukteshwar. the results indicate that the water quality of river ganga is unsuitable for drinking during sampling months, because the average nsfwqi was found to be 53.44 and 43.56, while cpi was 2.71 and 2.82 in post-and pre-monsoon, respectively. the river water has been found to be severely contaminated due to heavy metals (i. e. hpi >3) and indicates the human health risk (i. e. rai >1). therefore, it has been suggested that the river water must be treated to balance the nutrient concentration before used for drinking. further, by a comparative analysis of indices, nsfwqi and cpi have been found as the better suitable indices to classify the status of water quality.
geotextile	the influence of particle shape on the mechanical behavior of sand-woven geotextile interfaces over a wide domain of soil density and normal stress is studied. a uniformly graded angular fine sand, and a blend of well rounded glass beads with identical particle size distributions, were selected as granular material. experiments revealed the impact of particle shape on peak and residual friction angles as well as the maximum dilation angle of interfaces between both granular media and woven geotextile. it was observed that the residual friction angles of interfaces between angular sand/glass-beads and woven geotextile are very similar to the residual friction angles of angular sand and glass-beads in soil-soil direct shear test. it is understood that the peak friction angle and maximum dilation angle of angular sand-woven geotextile were slightly lower than corresponding values for angular sand in soil-soil direct shear test. while the peak friction angle and maximum dilation angle of angular sand-woven geotextile interface decrease with the increase in normal stress, experiments showed that these factors are insensitive to normal stress for glass beads-woven geotextile interfaces, at least for the range studied herein. all interfaces with woven geotextile as the contact surface exhibit an abrupt loss of shear strength in the post-peak regime of behavior. finally, a unified stress-dilation law for the angular sand-woven geotextile, glass beads-woven geotextile, and angular sand-roughened steel interfaces is obtained.

construction_management	purpose - the competition and challenges facing construction firms during the recent recession have brought risk management (rm) to the fore in people 's minds. examination of the difficulties of implementing rm in small and medium enterprises (smes) in the uk construction industry has been relatively untouched. the paper aims to discuss these issues. design/methodology/approach - as part of on-going research to facilitate rm processing aimed at improving the competitiveness of smes, the difficulties in rm implementation were identified through a literature review of rm implementation in smes. postal questionnaire were sent to smes who have experience of construction management. findings - of the 153 of smes responding, most highlighted that the main difficulty experienced is how to scale rm process to meet their requirements. none of the available standards explain the fundamental principle of applying rm to the situations that smes find themselves in. this difficulty is further exacerbated by a lack of management skills and knowledge in the adoption of rm tools or techniques to identify and analyse the business' risks. originality/value - the identified difficulties can be considered to develop a process to facilitate rm process within smes.
rainwater_harvesting	the present study refers to building-integrated solar thermal (bist) systems based on vacuum-tube collectors and it consists of two parts. in the first part, a literature review is presented, including studies about vacuum-tube technology (vacuum-tube/bist systems, the environmental profile of vacuum-tube collectors, etc.). critical issues, for example related to the integration of vacuum-tube collectors into the building, are highlighted. the review shows that most of the proposed vacuum-tube/bist concepts are about facade-integration and there are few studies about the environmental profile of vacuum-tube collectors. as a continuity of the issues presented in the first part, the second part includes a case study about the environmental comparison of a vacuum-tube/bist system with a flat-plate/bist configuration, based on life cycle assessment. the systems are gutter-integrated, patented and they have been developed/tested at the university of corsica, in france. multiple life-cycle impact assessment methodologies, environmental indicators, scenarios and databases are adopted. the results reveal that the energy payback time is 1.8 and 0.5 years, for the flat-plate/bist and for the vacuum-tube/bist, respectively, while by using recycling these values become 0.5 and 0.1 years, respectively. energy-return-on-investment, greenhouse-gas payback time and avoided impact during use phase (by adopting usetox, ecological footprint and france 's electricity as well as with reference domestic-gas-boiler co2.eq emissions) are also presented. the findings of the present work: 1) are compared with the literature and good agreement is observed, 2) verify that considerably higher impact can be avoided by utilizing the vacuum-tube/bist instead of the flat-plate/bist system.

ambient_intelligence	building systems to enable knowledge sharing and decision support among clinicians across organizational and geographical boundaries is a complex but important task that lies at the core of the idea of telehealth. practice-centered awareness has the potential to enhance the usability of cross-boundary clinical decision support systems by providing a shared context of work for decision support across organizational and geographical boundaries based on awareness of a clinician 's work contexts and practice-related work activities, including local workarounds, non-explicit rules, improvisation strategies, institutional agenda and patients' needs. we present a multi-method evaluation of the practice-centered awareness features of cadhealth. cadhealth is a clinical decision support system that enables clinicians to construct awareness of one another 's work activities and contexts across geographical and organizational boundaries based on three categories of work practice - ontological, stereotyped and situated work practices. evaluation results indicate that incorporating practice-centered awareness features in telehealth systems results in better work coordination across organizational and geographical boundaries, leads to more effective cross-boundary clinical decision support, and enhances the perceived usefulness and adoption of telehealth and e-health applications.

geotextile	although geotextile mats have considerable potential for soil conservation, field studies on their impacts on soil particle size distribution and nutrient conservation are scant. hence, field experiments were conducted at hilton, east shropshire, u.k. (52 degrees 33'5.7 '' n, 2 degrees 19'18.3 '' w) during 2007-2009, to study the impacts of palm-mat geotextiles on topsoil (0-5 cm) particle size distribution and changes in selected nutrients (total p, k, ca, mg, s, zn, cu, fe, mn, mo and cl). geotextile-mats constructed from borassus aethiopum (borassus palm of west africa) and mauritia flexuosa (buriti palm of south america) leaves are termed borassus mats and buriti mats, respectively. ten runoff plots (10 x 1 m on a 15 degrees slope) were established, with duplicate treatments. the treatments were: (i) bare soil; (ii) permanent grass; (iii) bare soil with 1 m borassus-mat buffer zones (area coverage similar to 10%) at the lower end of the plots; (iv) bare soil with 1 m buriti-mat buffer zones (area coverage similar to 10%) at the lower end of the plots; and (v) completely-covered with borassus mats. initial and final topsoil samples were collected and analysed for sand (fine, medium and coarse), silt (fine, medium and coarse), clay and selected nutrients. results revealed that soil silt and clay contents significantly (p<0.05) decreased in the borassus completely-covered plots with a concomitant increase in proportion of sand content after similar to 2 years. both borassus and buriti buffer strip plots also had lower soil clay contents, indicating that palm-mat geotextile cover significantly affected particle size distribution, even after only 2 years. buriti mat-cover within the buffer strip plots resulted in notably higher decrease in mean (n = 2) clay content, with a concomitant increase in mean (n = 2) sand contents compared with mean (n = 18) clay and sand contents of bare soils within the same plots. data indicate that total p and total k contents with borassus completely-covered plots significantly (p<0.01) increased and total ca content decreased after similar to 2 years. however, except grassed plots, all plots had significant (p<0.05) increases in total p concentrations. borassus buffer strip plots also had significant (p<0.05) decreases in total ca contents over the initial contents. the increases in total p and k contents within borassus complete-cover plots were significantly (p<0.05) higher than both grassed and buriti buffer strip plots. borassus buffer strip plots significantly (p0.05) effects on changes in other selected nutrients (total mg, s, zn, cu, fe, mn, mo and cl) concentrations. in summary, it is evident that despite significant (p<0.05) decreases in soil clay and total ca contents, use of borassus mats as buffer strips was very successful in conserving or improving other selected soil properties.

solar_energy	the model predictive control (mpc) technique for a solar-based series-resonant inverter conventionally used in domestic heating is explored. the photovoltaic energy system (pves) converts the solar energy into electrical energy where dc voltages of different cells are linked at a common bus. a cuk-converter is used to interface the pves with the dc load bus and the heating inverter. these heating inverters are replacing gas cookers in restaurants, guest rooms, and domestic- and commercial-kitchens for cooking of various foods. a number of control algorithms have been employed to control the power of the heating inverter but they have certain limitations; especially they do not predict the future response of the circuit. the mpc, an advanced control approach, has the potential to estimate the future behaviour of the model in a predictive manner. hence, to control the power of the resonant inverter connected with a 3.36 kw heating load, mpc is applied. the simulation results verify the validity of the power control of a solar-based series-resonant inverter using the mpc algorithm.
geotextile	in an urban highway network system such as tokyo metropolitan expressway. to detect conditions of road pavement and expansion joints is a very important issue. although accurate surface condition can be captured by using a road profiler system, the operating cost is expensive and development of a simpler and more inexpensive system is really needed to reduce monitoring cost. ""vehicle intelligent monitoring system (vims)"" developed for this purpose is described in this paper. an accelerometer and gps are installed to an ordinary road patrol car. gps together with a pc computer are used to measure the road surface condition and to identify the location of the vehicle, respectively dynamic response of the vehicle is used as a measure of the road pavements surface condition as well as the expansion joints. a prototype of vims is installed to a motor car and measurement is made at the actual roads. accuracy of measuring result and effectiveness of this system are demonstrated; the outline of the system and some of the measurement results are reported herein.
rainwater_harvesting	this paper documents the utility of the online tool ""rainwater harvesting and demand simulation"" forwarded by url http://gettanked.orgi, and categorizes performance variability with respect to koppen-geiger climatic classifications of the australian continent. this is a novel tool because it dynamically calculates the irrigation and evaporative cooling demands in addition to any particular per diem allocation of potable water. the analysis may be either from a finite storage tank of specified capacity, or drawn from water mains, but the present paper is focused on the design of secure off-grid rainwater harvesting systems (rwhs). the nominal consumption target of 155 l per diem per capita must be reduced by varying degrees depending on the locality. higher demand can be met if sufficient catchment and capacity are provided, or if regular tanker deliveries are readily available. alternatively, demand restrictions are tabulated as guidance to avoid running dry within the constraints of a nominal 10,000 l capacity storage with 100 m2 catchment-defining the sustainable load per diem (slpd) during a ""worst case"" epoch-this is the break-point for off-grid security. slpd varies from 86 to 124 l/d among most temperate maritime climate stations, and between 35 and 42 lid at most desert climate stations. the supporting on-line operating manual includes tabulations of demand for evaporative cooling and irrigation together with the sustainable yield of a rainwater harvest system at 128 locations throughout australia. dynamics of non-potable demands should be resolved before using the gettanked design tool for any particular dwelling or workplace. indoor and potable water demand must be disaggregated from irrigation, pool evaporation, and evaporative cooling in order to fully exploit the gettanked tool.

geotextile	self-healing capacities of geosynthetic clay liners (gcls) have been investigated using laboratory leakage rate tests. two types of gcl were tested. the first type was a geomembrane supported gcl (gm-gcl) and the second type was geotextile encased gcl (gt-gcl). the diameters of the defects investigated ranged from 5 to 50 mm. overburden stress (sigma) varied over the range 0-200 kpa. tap water, a solution of 10 g/l of nacl in tap water and a solution of 100 ml/l ethanol in tap water were used as the liquid permeants. the test results indicate that for both gm-gcl and gt-gcl, defects with diameters less than 30 mm can be self-healed providing the liquid is tap water or the ethanol and tap water solution. factors that tend to reduce the thickness of the diffusive double layer around particles of bentonite tend to reduce the self-healing capacity of a gcl, and the free swelling index of bentonite used in a gcl can be used to evaluate the self-healing capacity. the applied stress has two possible effects on self-healing capacity. one is the squeezing of hydrated bentonite into the damage hole and another is limiting the amount of hydration-induced expansion of the bentonite. for the conditions tested, the self-healing capacity increased with increasing applied stress.

ambient_intelligence	this paper describes the architecture and functionality of a generic agent that is in charge of handling a given environment in an ambient intelligence context, ensuring suitable contextualized and personalized support to the user 's actions, adaptivity to the user 's peculiarities and to changes over time, and automated management of the environment itself. the architecture is implemented in a multi-agent system, where different types of agents are endowed with different levels of reasoning and learning capabilities. in addition to controlling normal operations of the environment, the system may identify user 's needs and goals and activate suitable workflows to satisfy them. some actions in these workflow involve the execution of semantic services. when a single service is not available for fulfilling a given need, an automatic service composer is used to obtain a suitable combination of services. the architecture has been implemented in a prototypical agent-based system that works in a smart home environment.
water_pollution	water pollution is gradually increasing in natural waters through anthropogenic activities. this study aimed to use fish scales as a bio-indicator of pollution, along with water quality parameters, and the assessment and detection of selected heavy metals in water samples collected from the river chenab, including the chakbandi drain that gathers domestic sewage waste and industrial effluents from faisalabad and deposits it into this freshwater body. all water quality parameters (ph, total dissolved solids (tds), total suspended solids (tss), salinity, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (bod), chemical oxygen demand (cod), phenols and sulphates) and concentrations of selected heavy metals (cd, cu, mn, pb and cr) were found to be considerably higher than permissible limits as defined by the who, and therefore capable of causing ill health effects in aquatic organisms. specimens of fish scales from selected fish were described qualitatively and observed quantitatively. in catla catla, labeo rohita and cirrhinus mrigala, the scales showed several deformities in shape and different scale structures such as circuli, radii and annuli. in each of the three types of fish, considerable variation in the morphology of their scales was observed in specimens collected from polluted sites.
ambient_intelligence	new technologies have become an important support for the monitoring of older people in outdoor environments by their caregivers. smart phones equipped with a rich set of powerful sensors allowed the ubiquitous human activity recognition on mobile platforms at a low cost. ambient intelligence (ami) is an emergent area that provides useful mechanisms that allows tracking elderly people through opportunistic sensoring using smartphone devices. this paper aims to show the second version of saferoute, an ami system that fusions geo-localization sensors data embedded in smartphone devices for the monitoring of elderly people. this version improves functionalities of the previous one with the inclusion of new ones in the two components of this system: the android os application careofme and the web system saferoute. the proposed system merges localization data from gps and wifi sensors data in android os and includes the use of googlemaps functionalities in android os and web environments for provide alerts for caregivers.
water_pollution	dibromoacetonitrile (dban) is a disinfection by-product classified as a potential human and animal carcinogen. this study aimed at investigating the ability of myeloperoxidase (mpo) to oxidize dban to cyanide (cn-) in vitro. detection of cn- served as a marker for the possible generation of free radical intermediates implicated in dban-induced toxicity. optimum conditions for the oxidation of dban to cn- were characterized with respect to ph, temperature, and time of incubation as well as dban, mpo, potassium chloride, and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) concentrations in incubation mixtures. maximum reaction velocity and michaelis-menten constant were assessed. addition of sodium hypochlorite to the reaction mixtures significantly enhanced the rate of the reaction. addition of the mpo inhibitors, sodium azide, 4-amino benzoic acid hydrazine, or indomethacin to the reaction mixtures significantly decreased the rate of dban oxidation. inclusion of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase in the incubation mixtures significantly decreased the rate of reaction. inclusion of the sulfhydryl compounds as reduced glutathione, n-acetylcysteine, d-penicillamine, or l-cysteine enhanced the rate of dban oxidation. these results demonstrate the ability of mpo/h2o2/chloride ion system to oxidize dban to cn- and provide insight for the elucidation of dban chronic toxicity.
smart_material	poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (nipaam) is well known as a smart material with good thermal sensitivity and favorable biocompatibility. a series of new smart hydrogels, nipaam copolymerized with iam (itaconamic acid; 4-amino-2-methylene-4-oxobutanoic acid), were synthesized through radical solution polymerization in this work. poly(nipaam-co-iam) can respond to the changes of temperature as well as ph value. such a characteristic is due to the fact that iam contains not only a hydrophilic acrylic acid moiety but also an acrylamide moiety to be thermal and ph sensitive. the experimental results show that the lower critical solution temperature (lcst) of the copolymer increases as the molar fraction of iam increases. moreover, based on the current experimental data, 3 wt % of poly(nipaam-co-iam) aqueous solution in this study exhibits a phase transition temperature (37.8 degrees c) close to the human body temperature in the buffer solution of ph 7 possibly to be useful in drug delivery.

ambient_intelligence	background: alcohol ingestion influences sensory-motor function and the overall well-being of individuals. detecting alcohol induced impairments in gait in daily life necessitates a continuous and unobtrusive gait monitoring system. objectives: this paper introduces the development and use of a non-intrusive monitoring system to detect changes in gait induced by alcohol intoxication. methods: the proposed system employed a pair of sensorized smart shoes that are equipped with pressure sensors on the insole. gait features were extracted and adjusted based on individual 's gait profile. the adjusted gait features were used to train a machine learning classifier to discriminate alcohol-impaired gait from normal walking. in experiment of pilot study, twenty participants completed walking trials on a 12 meter walkway to measure their sober walking and alcohol-impaired walking using smart shoes. results: the proposed system can detect alcohol-impaired gait with an accuracy of 86.2% when pressure value analysis and person-dependent model for the classifier are applied, while statistical analysis revealed that no single feature was discriminative for the detection of gait impairment. conclusions: alcohol-induced gait disturbances can be detected with smart shoe technology for an automated monitoring in ubiquitous environment. we demonstrated that personal monitoring and machine learning-based prediction could be customized to detect individual variation rather than applying uniform boundary parameters of gait.
construction_management	transaction costs occur when a good or service is transferred across a technologically separable interface, and include the costs of drafting, negotiating and enforcing an agreement, and also the costs of governance and bonding to secure commitments. in the complex and high risk environment of a construction project, questionable decisions can be made in the planning and design phase, and disagreements, conflicts, disputes, change orders, and claims can occur in the construction phase. these problems contribute to an increase in transaction costs. transaction costs at the pre-contract phase of a project are different from the transaction costs at the post-contract phase. however, there is no consensus on a standard definition of transaction costs in construction projects. in this study, a detailed literature review focusing on transaction costs in construction project management is presented. the factors that affect transaction costs are identified and categorized under the headings of the owner 's and contractor 's roles in the transaction, project management efficiency, and the characteristics of the transaction environment.
rainwater_harvesting	multiple criteria decision making (mcdm) is a process of evaluating alternatives against relevant decision making criteria. several methods are available to facilitate the evaluation steps. this paper deals with a rural water supply problem in the coastal areas of bangladesh. three different mcdm methods - weighted summation, analytical hierarchy process, and novel approach to imprecise assessment and decision environments - were used to evaluate the suitable water supply alternative. the ranking of alternatives obtained from these mcdm techniques produced similar results. among five water supply alternatives evaluated, rainwater harvesting systems and deep tube wells scored first and second, respectively, for all three evaluation methods. in addition, sensitivity analyses were carried out for the mcdm techniques and these results did not show drastic variations either. this finding implies that while selection of mcdm technique is important, when evaluating similar problems more emphasis should be given to defining the problem comprehensively and thus selecting the relevant criteria and priorities to factor into the decision problem.
water_pollution	ozonation of a representative taste and odor compound, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxy pyrazine (ibmp), in drinking water was systematically investigated in this study. batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the influencing factors including initial ibmp concentration, o-3 addition rate, initial ph, h2o2 dosage, and different water qualities on the degradation of ibmp in the ozonation process. results showed that the degradation of ibmp followed pseudo-first order kinetics. the degradation rate constants increased with the increasing o-3 addition rate and initial ph value, whereas it decreased with the increasing initial ibmp concentration. degradation of ibmp is mainly dominated by direct ozone oxidation at low ph, while the free radical oxidation may become dominant at high ph levels. moreover, appropriate h2o2 dosage can greatly increase the ibmp degradation rates, but large excess h2o2 would act as an oh center dot scavenger and inhibit the degradation. in addition, lower degradation rate was observed in raw water, compared to that in deionized water. overall, ozonation can be a promising treatment technology to control ibmp-associated water pollution.
remote_sensing	contextual-based image classification attempts at considering spatial/temporal information during the learning process in order to make the classification process smarter. sequential learning techniques are one of the most used ones to perform contextual classification, being based on a two-step classification process, in which the traditional noncontextual learning process is followed by one more step of classification based on an extended feature vector. in this paper, we propose two ensemble-based approaches to make sequential learning techniques less prone to errors, since their effectiveness is strongly dependent on the feature extension process, which ends up adding the wrong predicted label of the neighborhood samples as new features. the proposed approaches are validated in the context of land-cover classification, being their results considerably better than some state-of-the-art techniques in the literature.
water_pollution	in this study, cluster analysis (ca) and discriminant analysis (da) were used to assess the water quality and evaluate its spatial and temporal variations in south florida. for this purpose, 15 years (2000-2014) data set of 12 water quality variables covering 16 monitoring stations, and about 35,000 observations were used. agglomerative hierarchical ca grouped 16 monitoring sites into three groups (low pollution, moderate pollution, and high pollution) based on their similarity of water quality characteristics. da, as an important data reduction method, and ca were used to assess the water pollution status and analysis of its spatiotemporal variation. it was found by the stepwise da that five variables (chi-a, do, tkn, tp and water temperature) were the most important discriminating water quality parameters responsible for temporal variations. in spatial da, the stepwise mode identified seven variables (chl-a, do, tkn, tp, magnesium, chloride, and sodium) and six variables (do, tkn, tp, turbidity, magnesium, and chloride) as the most important discriminating variables responsible for spatial variations in wet and dry seasons, respectively. different patterns associated with spatial variations were identified depending on the variables and considered season, however the overall trend of environment pollution problems was found from the low pollution (lp) region to high pollution (hp) region. it is believed that the results of this study could be very useful to the local authorities for the control and management of pollution and better protection of important riverine water quality.

solar_energy	reduced-graphene oxide (rgo) dispersed nanofluids were prepared by irradiating a graphene oxide (go)/water one under uv light for different times. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) analyses verified the reduction from go to rgo under the uv irradiation and indicated that the reduction degree increased with the time. zeta potential measurements suggested that the rgo/water nanofluids obtained under the irradiation time of 340 s or less can keep stable at elevated temperatures. the transmittance of the rgo/water nanofluids was quite less than that of the go/water one, indicating that the change from go to rgo greatly enhanced optical absorption. the rgo/water nanofluid obtained under the irradiation of 340 s possessed higher thermal conductivity and less specific heat than the go/water one. the good stability along with the high optical absorption and thermal conductivity make the rgo/water nanofluid exhibited superior photo-thermal conversion efficiency to the go/water and graphene (ge)/water ones at the same loading, which reached 96.93% at 30 degrees c and 52% at 75 degrees c. it is revealed that the rgo/water nanofluid prepared from the go/water one shows greater promise for use as the working fluid in low-temperature direct absorption solar collectors.
solar_energy	one design strategy by which to iterate the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconducting nanomaterials for harvesting solar energy involves the synthesis of type-ii heterostructured materials. in this article, a straightforward, facile and environmentally benign route to heterostructures in which sno2 nanospheres are capped by pbs nanocubes is reported. it offers to address current limitations to photocatalytic efficiency brought about by electron-hole recombination and narrow photoresponsive ranges in many existing systems. pbs nanocubes are grown in the presence of preformed sno2 nanospheres by functionalizing the surface of the latter using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab). heterostructure formation is confirmed by x-ray diffraction (xrd), raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps), brunauer-emmett-teller (bet) surface area analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (tem) analysis. rietveld refinement has been exploited to simultaneously elucidate the atomic and microstructures of these materials, allowing the quantitative determination of particle structure and stability. the combination of narrow band-gap semiconductor (pbs) and wide band-gap semiconductor (sno2) endows the heterostructured nanomaterial with potential as a photocatalyst and, in the degradation of rhodamine b(rhb) dye under solar simulation, it showed superior photocatalytic activity to that of its separate sno2 and pbs components. a strong type-ii interaction is demonstrated by the heterostructure and a charge separation mechanism has been utilized to clarify this behaviour.

smart_material	the purpose of this study is to develop a soft tactile sensor which can realize simultaneous measurements of surface shape and texture. we examine the possibility of the tactile sensor based on an ionic polymer-metal composite (ipmc). when tracing a measured object with the ipmc film, the surface shape is estimated from the displacement of the film, and the surface texture is estimated from the vibration of the film. the method for the estimation of displacement was already developed. in this paper, as a preliminary test, the estimation of the roughness of the surface texture was conducted by rubbing waterproof abrasive papers with the ipmc film. the output signals were processed offline, and the pattern classifications based on the frequency analysis were investigated. the differences of the ratio on frequency component of signals were detected against several kinds of the abrasive papers.
rainwater_harvesting	finding alternative resources to secure or increase water availability is a key issue in most urban areas. this makes the research of alternative and local water resources of increasing importance. in the context of political tension with its main water provider (malaysia), singapore has been implementing a comprehensive water policy for some decades, which relies on water demand management and local water resource mobilisation in order to reach water self-sufficiency by 2060. the production of water from alternative resources through seawater desalination or water reclamation implies energy consumptive technologies such as reverse osmosis. in the context of increasing energy costs and high primary energy dependency, this water self-sufficiency objective is likely to be an important challenge for singapore. the aim of this paper is to quantify the long-term impact of singapore 's water policy on the national electricity bill and to investigate the impact of singapore 's projects to reduce its water energy footprint. we estimate that 2.0% of the singaporean electricity demand is already dedicated to water and wastewater treatment processes. if its water-energy footprint dramatically increases in the coming decades, ambitious research projects may buffer the energy cost of water self-sufficiency.
rainwater_harvesting	participatory rainwater harvesting for promoting integrated development of agri-horti-livestock-cum-pisciculture was implemented during 2004-2008 at high altitude (>1500m msl) areas of mawlangkhar village, west khasi hills district, meghalaya in a watershed approach to assess and refine improved package of practices integrating crops, fruits, vegetables, fish and animal production for higher productivity and income. soil and water conservation measures like construction and renovation of ponds, jalkund-a micro rainwater harvesting structure on hilltops, bench and half moon terraces were developed with the active participation of the local peoples. the quantum of water harvested at one point of time during monsoon season through two ponds in community lands (2.69 million litre water), two ponds in individual farmer 's land (1.2 million litre water) and 15 jalkunds (0.45 million litre) on hill tops estimated to be about 4.3 million litre, was utilized for multiple purposes including irrigation, pisciculture, livestocks and domestic purpose. the cost of water harvesting in community pond was computed at [sic]12/1000 litre (l) and for jalkund [sic] 82/1000 litre considering the lives of pond and jalkund for at least 20 and 3 years, respectively. impact analysis revealed that the productivity has gone up by 30-40% in potato and 45-50 % in rice with the introduction of improved package of practices for various crops, availability of irrigation water and integration of different components. farmers are now able to get about [sic]2 440/month from community dairy unit and the individual farmer 's income from piggery unit increased substantially which ranged from [sic] 8 465 to 16 654/year. besides, farmers are earning a substantial income ([sic] 10 000/annum from community pond) from composite pisciculuture. therefore, integrated watershed programme could be considered as a successful model for high altitude areas of north east india and similar other ecosystems for livelihood improvement of resource poor tribal farmers.
water_pollution	the eastern coastal areas of china have high-density population, developed society and economy, and large water pollution emissions. how to reduce water pollution and realize the coordinated development of the economy and environment has become the national focus. effective environmental policies should consider regional differences in development stage and sustainability performance. here, we first analyzed the water pollution emissions intensity of the eastern coastal areas of china and the urgency of emissions reduction using 8-year environmental statistics from 2003 to 2010. we characterized development stages of the eastern coastal areas based on the relationships between water pollution emissions intensity and economic development. further, we built a coordination degree index of economic development and water environment protection as a measure of sustainability. results show that water pollution emissions intensity decreases as the economy grows from 2003 to 2010. the less-developed regions have a better coordination degree than some more-developed regions, especially those most-developed ones (e.g., shanghai show more pressures on long-term sustainability than hebei). the less-developed regions should take advantage of economic growth to invest more advanced environment protection technologies. the more-developed regions need to upgrade its economic structures and municipal infrastructures. overall, the study provided a comprehensive approach to understand regional difference in development stage and sustainability performance in the eastern coastal region of china as well as the need of different environmental policies to reduce water pollution emissions.

stealth_technology	m-type lead hexaferrites with compositions of pbfe12o19 and pbsnznfe10o19 were synthesized by the citrate sol-gel method. the structural and magnetic properties of resultant particles were investigated by x-ray diffraction (xrd), transmission electron microscope (tem), vibrating sample magnetometer (vsm) and vector network analyzer. the magnetic properties such as saturation magnetization (m-s) and coercivity (h-c) were calculated from the hysteresis loops. microwave absorption properties of ferrite-polymer composites prepared with different ferrite ratios of 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% have been investigated in the frequency range of 12-20 ghz. the composite powder with 80 wt% lead ferrite possesses good microwave absorption properties. the minimum reflection loss of the composite powder reaches -30 db at the thickness of 2 mm for composite powder with 80 wt% ferrite. the composite with 80% ferrite content has shown a minimum reflection loss of -24.5 db at 18.6ghz with the -15 db bandwidth over the extended frequency range of 16.3-19.4ghz for an absorber thickness of 1.8 mm. the prepared composites can fruitfully be utilized for suppression of electromagnetic interference (emi) and reduction of radar signatures (stealth technology).
water_pollution	concentration of eight heavy metals in surface and groundwater around dhaka export processing zone (depz) industrial area were investigated, and the health risk posed to local children and adult residents via ingestion and dermal contact was evaluated using deterministic and probabilistic approaches. metal concentrations (except cu, mn, ni, and zn) in bangshi river water were above the drinking water quality guidelines, while in groundwater were less than the recommended limits. concentration of metals in surface water decreased as a function of distance. estimations of non-carcinogenic health risk for surface water revealed that mean hazard index (hi) values of as, cr, cu, and pb for combined pathways (i.e., ingestion and dermal contact) were >1.0 for both age groups. the estimated risk mainly came from the ingestion pathway. however, the hi values for all the examined metals in groundwater were1 x 10(-4) for adult and children, respectively. deterministic and probabilistic estimations of cancer risk through exposure to groundwater were well below the safety limit. overall, the population exposed to bangshi river water remained at carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health threat and the risk was higher for adults. sensitivity analysis identified exposure duration (ed) and ingestion rate (ir) of water as the most relevant variables affecting the probabilistic risk estimation model outcome.

suspension_bridge	a simplified method for predicting the deflections of cable-stayed suspension bridges considering live loads is presented. in the proposed method the governing equation of the cable-stayed suspension bridge, based on potential energy method, is derived. a fourier series is used to describe the defections of the bridge deck. it has been shown from the numerical investigation of two different cable-stayed suspension bridges that the iteration procedure has a very high convergence rate. only a few iterations are needed and a small number of series terms are sufficient for achieving the solutions of the problems. the predictions of the proposed method show good agreement with finite element results.
solar_energy	space solar power station (ssps) is a comprehensive system that continuously collects solar energy in space and transmits it to ground with a wireless power transmission (wpt) system. these systems have great potential to provide large-scale energy. to increase the efficiency and reduce the weight and cost of the photovoltaic (pv) components, a huge light-weighted concentrator was introduced in the latest ssps concepts, such as integrated symmetrical concentrator (isc) and arbitrarily large phased array (alpha). however, for typical ssps running in geostationary earth orbit (geo), the sunlight direction varies with time, leading to a great challenge for concentrator design. in isc, the two-dimensional mast is used to realize sun-tracking. however, a multi-thousand-ton structure is difficult to control precisely in space. for this reason, alpha comprises a large number of individually pointed thin-film reflectors to intercept sunlight, mounted on the non-moving structure. however, the real-time adjustment of the thousands of reflectors is still an open problem. furthermore, the uniformity of the time of the power generation (utpg) is another factor evaluating the system. therefore, this paper proposes a novel concentrator based on zero-index metamaterial (zim) called thin-film energy terminator (ssps-tent). this will aid the control of the massive reflectors while avoiding the rotation of the overall system, the control of the massive reflectors and the influence of the obliquity of the ecliptic. also, an optimization design method is proposed to increase its solar energy collecting efficiency (ece) and flux distribution (fd). the ray-tracing simulation results show that the ece is more than 96% of the day. in terms of the fd, the uniformity varies from 0.3057 to 0.5748. compared with alpha, the utpg is more stable.

ambient_intelligence	ambient intelligence has emerged lately as the integrating concept which includes ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous communication and intelligent user interfaces. the real implementation of such concepts is based on the use of new technology and innovative ways of development. agent oriented software engineering techniques and concepts have been used as a way of providing support to ubiquitous computing and communication. in addition, intelligent user interfaces require systems that provide a more efficient and rich interface with the user than the traditional ones. this paper presents a platform called mapas, which uses ambient intelligence concepts and techniques to give a fully scalable solution to a particular problem. the chosen system provides a solution, using the platform, to personalize the dissemination of events, that is, the system makes available to the user a set of events of his/her interest. this kind of systems requires a high degree of user 's personalization. however nowadays, it is the user who must search the events of interest or subscribe to several different services or pages. the platform introduced in this paper takes profit of agent oriented technology to provide a system composed of various agents who may run in different devices, which communicate and provide a user personalized selection of events. moreover, the system is aware of the surrounding environment, can be installed on smart devices, provides a rich and intuitive user interface and uses augmented reality techniques to give spatial location data about the events. regarding the characteristics of the solution, it seems to be suitable for problems in the domain of ambient intelligence.
remote_sensing	scene change detection between multitemporal image scenes can be used to interpret the variation of regional land use, and has significant potential in the application of urban development monitoring at the semantic level. the traditional methods directly comparing the independent semantic classes neglect the temporal correlation, and thus suffer from accumulated classification errors. in this paper, we propose a novel scene change detection method via kernel slow feature analysis (ksfa) and postclassification fusion, which integrates independent scene classification with scene change detection to accurately determine scene changes and identify the ""from-to"" transition type. after representation with the bag-of-visual-words model, ksfa is proposed to extract the nonlinear temporally invariant features, to better measure the change probability between corresponding multitemporal image scenes. two postclassification fusion methods, which are based on bayesian theory and predefined rules, respectively, are then employed to identify the optimal coupled class combinations of multitemporal scene pairs. furthermore, in addition to identifying semantic changes, the proposed method can also improve the performance of scene classification, since the unchanged scenes are more likely to belong to the same class. two experiments with high-resolution remote sensing image scene data sets confirm that the proposed method can increase the accuracy of scene change detection, scene transition identification, and scene classification.
green_building	expanding on the concept of green building, sustainable development is being implemented across various infrastructure systems. performance metrics and rating systems have been developed to measure the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the development process. the transportation sector has adapted with the development of sustainable rating systems, such as greenroads, which focuses on roadway planning, design, and construction. efforts to support more sustainable modes, such as pedestrian and cycling, have led to the development of new transportation rating systems, such as greenpaths. the greenpaths rating system, developed as part of a previous research project, includes sustainable performance metrics related to the planning, location, design, construction, safety, and maintenance of shared-use pathways. this research builds on the development of the rating system and explores the feasibility of applying greenpaths to various pathway development phases (existing, in development, and proposed). therefore, the rating system is applied to three case study phases along the buffalo valley rail trail in union county, pa. the results of the case study applications provide insight into the implementation process to three different development phases as well as an opportunity for rating system improvement. results show that using the rating system earlier in the planning and design phase can lead to improvements in the integration of sustainable practices. the greenpaths case studies serve as examples of how to implement the rating system for real-world pathway projects to support the development of sustainable transportation systems.
ambient_intelligence	uncertainty must be taken into account in all aspects of ambient intelligence and human decisions and activities. we investigate how to utilize both probabilistic and possibilistic sources of information for use in humanized decision-making. in particular we examine aspects of the possibilistic conditioning of probability developed by yager. to provide bounding of the resulting probability analysis of the cases of completely certain and uncertain probability and possibility distribution are carried out. additionally the cases of intermediate uncertainty and a general case of possibilities are analyzed. the zadeh consistency measure is also used to assess these cases. to consider whether the conditioned probability is more informative for decision-making, three measures, shannon entropy, gini index and renyi entropy are used to compare the original probability distributions and the conditioned distribution for the cases described.
suspension_bridge	the optimal placement of wireless sensors is very different from conventional wired sensor placement due to the limited transmission range of the wireless sensors. this constraint on the inter-sensor distance makes the optimization problem difficult to solve with conventional gradient-based methods. in this paper, an improved generalized genetic algorithm (gga) based on a self-adaptive dynamic penalty function (sadpf) is proposed for the optimal wireless sensor placement (owsp) in bridge vibration monitoring. the mathematical model of the owsp problem is established, and it considers both the bridge vibration monitoring requirements and the constraints of the data transmission range in wireless sensor networks (wsns). sadpf, which can automatically adjust the amount of penalization for constraint violations according to the evolution generation number and the degree of violation, is then developed so that the wireless sensor placement can be optimized using gga. subsequently, the gga is improved by implementing an elite conservation strategy, a worst elimination policy and a dual-structure coding system. finally, a numerical experiment is presented with a long-span suspension bridge to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method, and some indispensible discussions are also given. the results indicate that the wireless sensor configurations that are optimized by the improved sadpf-based gga can simultaneously meet the data transmission demands in a wsn and fulfill the requirements for structural condition assessment. the developed sadpf can minimize the influence of the limited data transmission range on the search process for the owsp. the improved sadpf-based gga quickly and robustly converges to the global optimal solution.
solar_energy	this study provides the first attempt to combine uio-66(zr) with bi2moo6 for the preparation of composite via electrostatic interaction induced self-assembly process. synthesized products were characterized by x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscopy (sem), fourier transform infrared spectroscope (ft-ir), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps), brunauer-emmett-teller (bet) surface area analyse and uv-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (uv-vis drs). the photocatalytic activities of as-obtained bi2moo6/uio-66(zr) composites were assessed by degradation of rhodamine b (rh b) under the visible-light irradiation. comparing to the pristine materials, the developed bi2moo6/uio-66(zr) composite with bi:zr molar ratio 2:1, labelled as bmuo-2, showed the best photocatalytic activity. it was supposed that the participation of bi2moo6 increased the use of solar energy and the existence of uio-66(zr) restrained the recombination rate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. moreover, bi2moo6/uio-66(zr) composite showed excellent stability and recyclability during cycling experiment. the mechanism and plausible pathway of rh b degradation were also discussed in this paper.

geotextile	to achieve proper bonding between the pavement layers it is necessary to spread the precise amount of tack coat. in several laboratory tests, effectiveness of a newly designed device to control the tack coat dosage applied on site is studied, in which the most influential variables are surface macro-texture and amount of tack coat applied, with a negligible influence of the emulsion type. according to the results obtained, the geotextile absorbs higher percentages of emulsion for samples of bituminous mixtures with lower surface macro-texture values, e.g. ac16d, while the lowest percentages of absorbed emulsion are obtained for samples with higher surface macro-texture values, e.g. bbtm11a. the emulsion percentage absorbed by the geotextile is directly related with the quantity of emulsion in charge of the bond between layers.

suspension_bridge	vortex-induced vibration (viv) is one of self-excited vibration with limited amplitude, usually occurring on long and slender structures with lower damping. a nonlinear method based on scanlan 's nonlinear vortex-induced vibration model is proposed in this paper for interpreting the test results of section model into prototype structure. partial correlation of vortex-induced aerodynamic force along span is considered in this method, and the identifying method of parameters in the semi-empirical mathematic model is improved. validity of proposed theory is confirmed by section model tests and observed results in field of a long-span suspension bridge.

water_pollution	the yuyang coal mine drainage can potentially have a negative impact on the surrounding drinking water, including the hongshixia water source, causing detrimental effects to the environment and on human health. here, contamination from the coal mine was analyzed by physicochemical interpretation and numerical simulation. we constructed two sampling profiles along the groundwater flow and transverse directions, and collected twenty-six groundwater samples near the drainage ponds from the yuyang coal mine for physicochemical analysis and interpretation. and in terms of the numerical simulations, we chose the modflow software to describe river, drainage ponds and reservoir and establish the flow model. we chose the mt3dms modular software to build a solute transport model, and established a three-dimensional transient numerical model to predict the migration of total fe and so4 (2-). the physicochemical analytical results indicate the groundwater quality degrades as we approach the drainage ponds. the variations of ion concentrations in the eastward and northward directions show the migration distance of the contaminants in the eastward direction (e.g., the direction of groundwater flow) is much greater to that in the northward direction (e.g., perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction). numerical simulation results suggest within the predicted days, the concentrations of fe and so4 (2-) in the mine drainage ponds will be higher to that of the acceptable levels recommended by the national groundwater quality guidelines, imposing serious risks to the surrounding groundwater and human health. the pollution plumes of the contaminants migrate closer to the groundwater source governed by groundwater flow, suggesting the mine drainage may pose a risk to the groundwater quality of the hongshixia water source.
green_building	recent natural events such as earthquakes in japan and storm surge effects in new york have led to the growing interest in sustainable civil engineering. while sustainability topics, such as soil liquefaction and green building design, are typically included within civil engineering programs at the baccalaureate or graduate levels, topics in sustainability can be adapted for secondary school students as well. in addition, efforts to attract quality and diverse students into civil engineering have given rise to engineering camps aimed at secondary school students. this research focuses on the exploration of civil engineering sustainable module topics for secondary school students through the development of content as well as implementation of two case studies. sustainability module topics are identified and instructional content (lesson objectives, key concepts, activities, experiments, and other pedagogical techniques) are proposed. two modules are applied at the bucknell engineering summer camp program, targeting secondary school students. the module topics developed, as well as the case study results, can provide examples for how engineering educators throughout the country can introduce sustainable civil engineering as a way to encourage future civil engineering students.

water_pollution	municipal wastewater reuse has been an important way to enhance water pollution control and water conservation in china. however, many pollutants, such as n, p, chemical oxygen demand (codcr), and 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (bod5), are contained in the reclaimed water that can pollute the groundwater environment around rivers and lakes supplied with reclaimed water. therefore, an environmentally friendly method to control infiltration and purification is quite necessary. original sediment is one potential option. therefore, in this study, the effects of sediment thickness at 5, 10, and 20 cm were studied for water infiltration and purification processes in riverbed media. the results indicate that the infiltration efficiency of the riverbed media was reduced when the sediment formed gradually and reached an appreciable level. the thickness was kept at 5-20 cm, and the ranges of the removal efficiencies for bod5, codcr, ammonium-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were 47.7-69.0, 49.9-62.7, 90.6-92.5, 30.5-45.8, 42.7-63.1, and 62.2-77.9%, respectively, by a sediment and soil pillar of riverbed media. the removal efficiencies increased by increasing the sediment thickness, and the final infiltration rates were over 10(-4) cm/s. the riverbed infiltration remained steady even when thickness was beyond 20 cm, and the purification effect was obvious. the ammonium-nitrogen removal efficiency of the riverbed filtration system did not appear to have an unlimited increase with the increase in sediment thickness. generally, the existence of a nitrification and denitrification interface was located in the sedimentary layer, and it remained anaerobic at the bottom over a 10-cm thickness. because ammonium-nitrogen was involved in nitrification, the nitrate-nitrogen concentration of the percolate tended to increase at the beginning of experiments. as the adsorption and nitrification took place, over 90% of ammonium-nitrogen was removed in the riverbed infiltration system through attachment to sediments. the experimental results could be used as references in river regulation.
smart_material	most sensors are based on ceramic or semiconducting substrates, which have no flexibility or biocompatibility. polymer-based sensors have been the subject of much attention due to their ability to collect molecules on their sensing surface with flexibility. beyond polymer-based sensors, the recent discovery of cellulose as a smart material paved the way to the use of cellulose paper as a potential candidate for mechanical as well as electronic applications such as actuators and sensors. several different paper-based sensors have been investigated and suggested. in this paper, we review the potential of cellulose materials for paper-based application devices, and suggest their feasibility for chemical and biosensor applications.
ambient_intelligence	indoor localization is a key topic for the ambient intelligence (aml) research community. in this scenarios, recent advancements in wearable technologies, particularly smartwatches with built-in sensors, and personal devices, such as smartphones, are being seen as the breakthrough for making concrete the envisioned smart environment (se) paradigm. in particular, scenarios devoted to indoor localization represent a key challenge to be addressed. many works try to solve the indoor localization issue, but the lack of a common dataset or frameworks to compare and evaluate solutions represent a big barrier to be overcome in the field. the unavailability and uncertainty of public datasets hinders the possibility to compare different indoor localization algorithms. this constitutes the main motivation of the proposed dataset described herein. we collected wi-fi and geo-magnetic field fingerprints, together with inertial sensor data during two campaigns performed in the same environment. retrieving sincronized data from a smartwatch and a smartphone worn by users at the purpose of create and present a public available dataset is the goal of this work.
green_building	although extensive research has investigated the benefits of green buildings very little is known about user perception and satisfaction. most of the studies involving users in green buildings are in the form of post-occupancy evaluations that gather satisfaction scores and qualitative feedback from building occupants. however it is difficult to generalize these individual case studies to a wider discussion of preferences for green building attributes. the current research uses a more generalizable technique to examine occupants' experiences in green buildings. this study identifies the relative importance of environmental and experiential design categories by occupants based on lived experiences in the space. the article provides the results of a choice-based conjoint (cbc) study that compares responses from green and non-green building occupants. the results provide novel insights into the degree of importance of experiential categories of design, such as social territories, visual, and non-visual aesthetics, compared with environmental categories of design, such as energy efficiency, water savings, and indoor environmental quality. the article contributes to the green building design literature by evaluating green buildings from a new perspective that is based on users' preferences. this perspective can be influential in developing green building rating systems for enhancing green building performance.

geotextile	infrastructure sustainability has become a major global concern. massive reservoir siltations (rs) have seriously disrupted the service of many reservoirs worldwide. the dredged siltations are difficult to stockpile, or dispose of, because of their high water content and soft nature. this study explores a novel approach using rs to produce controlled low-strength materials (clsm), reinforced with geobags that are used for storage and backfill applications. test results have shown that, initially, geobags provided a significant contribution to the strength improvement of an rs-based clsm. however, effective reinforcement appears to be highly dependent upon the type of geotextile and the original strength of the rs-clsm. the results show a promising solution for reusing reservoir siltations and ensuring a sustainable approach for the mitigation of a silted reservoir.
geotextile	in this study, large-size direct shear tests were conducted to determine the interfacial shear characteristics of sand geotextile under three different normal stresses. the geotextiles used in the present study were hybrid needlepunched nonwovens containing defined weight proportions of jute and polypropylene fibers. subsequently, the interfacial shear characteristics of hybrid and that of a nonwoven geotextile consisting of solely polypropylene fibers with sand were compared and analyzed under different normal stresses. initial higher shear stiffness of sand-polypropylene geotextiles was observed corresponding to sand-hybrid geotextiles specifically under higher normal stresses. nevertheless, the contact efficiency of sand-hybrid nonwovens was similar to that of sand-polypropylene geotextiles. the surface morphology of sand particles has been investigated based on the images obtained from scanning electron microscopy (sem) and quantitatively analyzed by means of wadell roundness and degree of angularity methods.

water_pollution	in this study, fe3o4/graphene nanocomposite was synthesized through a liquid-phase co-precipitation method and characterized using x-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectrometer. the synthetic fe3o4/graphene was used as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate persulfate to efficiently degrade methylene blue (mb). the target pollutant mb can be degraded by sulfate radicals depending on several parameters including persulfate and fe3o4/graphene concentrations, ph and reaction temperature. within 120 min of reaction time, almost 100% of 0.05 mm mb was removed by 1.5 mm persulfate in the presence of 150 mg/l of fe3o4/graphene at ph = 6.0 and 25 degrees c. the degradation of mb was found to follow the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. the fe3o4/graphene has much better stability and reusability than free fe3o4 suggested by reuse tests. the results demonstrate that fe3o4/graphene activated persulfate is a promising technology for remediation of water pollution caused by organic contaminants.
green_building	lime mud from papermaking process (lmp) as a toxic industrial waste has high moisture content. fly ash and cement aided dewatering of lmp was developed and the best efficiency was obtained when fly ash and cement were added simultaneously. the dewatered lmp was calcined at different temperatures to prepare lime. available lime content and crystalline phases were detected. mixtures of lmp and cement presented the highest available lime content. after calcining at 800-1200 degrees c, mixtures of 90 wt % lmp and 10 wt % fly ash contained lime (cao) and dicalcium silicate (beta-ca2sio4) as the major phases. the application performance of the prepared lime was investigated by using it in the autoclaved products and the results showed that autoclaved products with high strength were obtained and they were green building materials.

green_building	considering the characteristics of frequent occurrence and serious losses, a technology for the standpipe in flat roof of green building community was designed to alleviate the urban waterlogging, and a test was carried out to find out the influence of the concrete height, underlying surface and return period on reduction rate of peak discharge and rainwater pipe diameter. results showed that the reduction rate of peak discharge increased with the increase of concrete height, and the reduction rate kept constant as 36.98% when the concrete height was 5 cm or more. the reduction rate of peak discharge increased with the increase of roof area proportion, while the reduction rate of peak discharge decreased with the increase of return period. at the same time, these results can be used to guide practical engineering.

green_building	building sustainability is subject to rational use of green-building systems and techniques. a suitable combination of these systems and techniques is at the heart of design parameters. to achieve user comfort and health as well as environmental protection and long-term economic benefits, designers must optimize combinations of particular systems and techniques. it is imperative to have efficient design strategies for achieving optimum solutions and effectively leading the complex process of selecting system and technique combinations to be integrated in overall design. with goal to optimize design effort, this research aims to propose different methodologies to help incorporate various green-building systems and techniques in design process. systems and techniques prioritized by relative weights may ease the design process. hence, with a focus on semi-arid climatic conditions, interviews are conducted from researchers and building practitioners who help express design priorities. use of these priorities through the proposed design approach in case study of a sustainable residential building validates the workability of design methodology. consequently, a model is proposed for integration of all three sustainability dimensions as design criteria in building simulation programs, facilitating the realization of green-building design.
remote_sensing	our knowledge of autumn phenology and its response to climate variability is currently limited. one way to improve our understanding of autumn phenology at the landscape scale is to investigate autumn vegetation dynamics based on multiple vegetation indices from remote sensing data. in this study, we derived two autumn phenological metrics (phenometrics), onset of drying and dormancy, for semi-arid grasslands from modis normalized difference water index (ndwi) time series. the onset of drying represents the start of decline in the vegetation 's metabolism during autumn, and the onset of ndwi-based dormancy signifies the end of metabolic activity. these ndwi-based phenometrics were then compared with enhanced vegetation index (evi)-based phenometrics in northeastern china from 2001 to 2013. influences of climatic variability on autumn phenology were analyzed using partial correlation analysis. we found that, in general, the onset of drying was slightly later than the onset of evi-based senescence. both did not strongly correlate with precipitation and mean minimum temperature in august. the onset of ndwi-based dormancy had, on average, a time lag of seven days, relative to the onset of evi-based dormancy during 2001-2013. moreover, it showed a much stronger response to mean minimum temperature in september than evi-based dormancy. a colder autumn generally advanced the onset of ndwi-based dormancy, while it had little effect on the onset of evi-based dormancy in the study area. these results suggest that phenological studies using ndwi could expand our understanding of land surface phenology. furthermore, considering the different responses of the onset of ndwi- and evi-based dormancy to climate variability, a combination of these phenometrics could contribute to the study of the ecosystem processes (e.g., carbon cycle) in semi-arid grasslands.

stealth_technology	herpesviruses stand out for their capacity to establish lifelong infections of immunocompetent hosts, generally without causing overt symptoms. herpesviruses are equipped with sophisticated immune evasion strategies, allowing these viruses to persist for life despite the presence of a strong antiviral immune response. although viral evasion tactics appear to target virtually any stage of the innate and adaptive host immune response, detailed knowledge is now available on the molecular mechanisms underlying herpesvirus obstruction of mhc class i-restricted antigen presentation to t cells. this opens the way for clinical application. here, we review and discuss recent efforts to exploit human herpesvirus mhc class i evasion strategies for the rational design of novel strategies for vaccine development, cancer treatment, transplant protection and gene therapy. immunology and cell biology (2011) 89, 359-366; doi:10.1038/icb.2010.129; published online 8 february 2011
suspension_bridge	a three-degrees of freedom (3-dof) coupled numerical simulation technique for synchronously extracting 18 aerodynamic derivatives of bridge decks is proposed and evaluated in this study. computations are performed with a finite volume unstructured computational flow dynamics (cfd) solver using two-dimensional (2d) hybrid meshes with fine near-wall resolution. the accuracy of the numerical model is verified by identifying the aerodynamic derivatives of one thin plate section with theoretical solutions. further, for two typical deck sections (streamlined and bluff) of two long-span bridges, the extracted 18 aerodynamic derivatives from both coupled and uncoupled techniques are compared. the results showed good agreement with the experimental results. the proposed 3-dof coupled method can provide almost the same level of accuracy as the 1-dof method and saves about 67% of the computation time. the appropriateness of the linear superposition theorem for the aeroelastic forces generated by different motions (single and coupled mode) is examined, and found that there are significant differences in both aerostatic and aeroelastic forces. various high-order aeroelastic force components are successfully captured by the newly presented coupled numerical simulation, and the aerodynamic derivatives are proved to be immune to the high-order components mathematically. this knowledge is essential for a thorough evaluation of aerodynamic derivatives identification accuracy. the proposed technique and the analytical viewpoints presented in this paper may serve as the building block for developing new numerical tools and analytical frameworks for rapid and accurate evaluation of aerodynamic derivatives, and the response of long-span flexible bridges to wind excitation.

smart_material	a novel strategy was developed to prepare double responsive smart upconversion fluorescence material for highly specific enrichment and sensing of glycoprotein. the novel double responsive smart sensing material was synthesized by choosing horse radish peroxidase (hrp) as modal protein, the grapheme oxide (go) as support material, upconversion nanoparticles (ucnps) as fluorescence signal reporter, n-isopropyl acrylamide (nipaam) and 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (vpba) as functional monomers. the structure and component of smart sensing material was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (tem), scanning electron microscopy (sem), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (xps) and fourier transform infrared (ftir), respectively. these results illustrated the smart sensing material was prepared successfully. the recognition characterizations of smart sensing material were evaluated, and results showed that the fluorescence intensity of smart sensing material was reduced gradually, as the concentration of protein increased, and the smart sensing material showed selective recognition for hrp among other proteins. furthermore, the recognition ability of the smart sensing material for glycoprotein was regulated by controlling the ph value and temperature. therefore, this strategy opens up new way to construct smart material for detection of glycoprotein.

construction_management	gathering information that is capable to explain customers' needs is usually seen as a quite straightforward part of the traditional construction process: a customer should be able to tell all relevant needs in the first stage so that a building could be designed and built according to the gained information. but the process is lacking of service abilities if a customer wants to modify the given information due to a change in circumstances, albeit such a change is easily caused due turbulent economic situations and long spans in real-estate development projects. hence the customer perspective regarding the construction management (cm) process should be accommodated better. in this paper, the case studies of the four premises improvement projects are reported upon, where the cm process was altered to include and apply the concepts of continuous improvement and co-creation. the process documentation covered the impacts of the case project on the usability of the premises, the indoor climate conditions (carbon dioxide and temperature) metering, the time lapse cameras and the on-line user feedback system. the documentation consists of the minutes of the meetings, the financial reporting and the time tables. both the processes and the results of the projects are analysed. based on the key findings, some suggestions are put forth upon how to improve the cm process to better serve customer interests and quality improvement in the future.

solar_energy	energy is crucial to economic progress, but the contemporary worldwide population increase that demands greater energy generated from conventional exhaustible resources, an energy price upsurge, and environmental concerns, imperils sustainable economic growth. nevertheless, switching to renewable energy produced from naturally replenished resources promotes energy security, likewise addressing issues such as global warming and climate change. this paper aims at exploring the influence and causal relation between renewable energy, both overall and by type, and sustainable economic growth of european union (eu)-28 countries for the period of 2003-2014. we notice that the mean share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption is 15%, while the mean share of renewable energy in transport fuel consumption is 3%, which are below the thresholds of 20% and 10%, respectively, as set by the eu directive 2009/28/ec. by estimating panel data fixed-effects regression models, the results provide support for a positive influence of renewable energy overall, as well as by type, namely biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind power, and solar energy on gross domestic product per capita. however, biomass energy shows the highest influence on economic growth among the rest of renewable energy types. in fact, a 1% increase of the primary production of solid biofuels increases gdp per capita by 0.16%. besides, cointegrating regressions set on panel fully modified and dynamic ordinary least squares regressions confirm the positive influence related to the primary production of renewable energies on economic growth. a 1% increase in primary production of renewable energies increases gdp per capita by 0.05%-0.06%. however, the results of granger causality based on panel vector error correction model indicate both in short-run and long-run a unidirectional causal relationship running from sustainable economic growth to the primary production of renewable energies, being supported the conservation hypothesis.
stealth_technology	this first study deals with the one-dimensional (1d) problem of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by an obstacle coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer. ferromagnetic materials have nonlinear behavior and are widely used in stealth technology as absorbing coatings. our objective is the derivation, the stability analysis, and the numerical approximation of effective boundary conditions that permit simulation, at least approximatively, of the effect of the thin layer, avoiding the discretization of maxwells equations inside this layer.
ambient_intelligence	with the increasing emergence of ambient intelligence, sensors and wireless network technologies, robotic assistance becomes a very active area of research in autonomous intelligent systems. robotic systems would be integrated in the environment as physical autonomous entities. these entities will be able to interact independently with the ambient environment and provide services such as assistance to people at homes, offices, buildings and public spaces. furthermore, robots as cognitive entities will be able to coordinate their activities with other physical or logical entities, to move, to feel and explore the surrounding environment, decide and act to meet the situations they may encounter. these cognitive operations will be part of a smart network which can provide individually or collectively, new features and various support services anywhere and anytime. the aim of this research work is to build a multimodal fusion engine using the semantic web. this multimodal system will be applied on a wheelchair with a manipulated arm to help people with disabilities interact with their main tool of movement and their environment. this work focuses on building a multimodal interaction fusion engine to better understand the multimodal inputs using the concept of ontology.

geotextile	mechanical characteristics of nonwoven geotextile materials depend on their structural and constructional solutions, as well as technological development conditions. in addition, a very important role have the structural and physical-mechanical properties of the fiber, mass per unit area of geotextile and density of needle punching in the production process. this paper presents the results of analysis of mechanical properties of nonwoven geotextile materials with mass per unit area 300 glm(2), intended for road construction. breaking characteristics of geotextile materials made from regular and recycled polyester fibers are analyzed. characteristic of breaking strength of geotextile materials was measured on dynamometer zwik, the results were analyzed by software testxpert. the obtained results are defined relation between force-elongation and rheological models have been developed which can be used to simulate the behavior of nonwoven geotextile materials of regular and recycled pes fiber during exploitation.
geotextile	the commonly adopted method of dumping dredge spoil at sea using split-hull barges leads to considerable sediment loss to the water column and a subsequent dispersion of fine material that can pose a risk to sensitive ""downstream"" habitats such as coral reefs. containing sediment loads using stitched closed geotextile bags is practiced for minimizing loss of contaminated sediment, but is expensive in terms of operational efficiency. following promising observations from initial laboratory trials, the plunging of partially shielded sediment loads, released on open sea, was studied. the partial shielding was achieved with rigid, open containers as well as flexible, open bags. the loss of sediment from these modes of shielding was measured, and it was observed that even limited and unstitched shielding can be effective in debilitating the entrainment of water into the descending load. in particular, long-sleeved flexible bags practically self-eliminated the exposure of the load and thus losses.

construction_management	the increased interest for materiality as an analytical category in the social sciences provide construction management and economics scholar with new possibilities to better exploit the detailed empirical data being collected in the construction industry and related fields. while constructivist and other idealist theories have tended to dominate the social sciences since at least the mid-sixties when the social sciences sought to release itself from the methodological dogmatism of the ""hard sciences"", materiality is now recognized and subject to theorizing within different social science traditions. this article advocates a broad engagement with materiality within construction management research and presents a series of analytical concepts and empirical studies that stress how the built environment that human beings inhabit is far from passive, inert and stable as common sense thinking easily misleads analysts to believe. an image of materiality that recognizes an agential, dynamic and more fluid nature of materiality is thus arguably conducive to an intellectually stimulating construction management scholarship.
construction_management	time, cost, and quality are three important but often conflicting factors that must be optimally balanced during the planning and management of construction projects. tradeoff optimization among these three factors within the project scope is necessary to maximize overall project success. in this paper, the moa-bcde-tcqt, a new hybrid multiple objective evolutionary algorithm that is based on hybridization of artificial bee colony and differential evolution, is proposed to solve time-cost-quality tradeoff problems. the proposed algorithm integrates crossover operations from differential evolution (de) with the original artificial bee colony (abc) in order to balance the exploration and exploitation phases of the optimization process. a numerical construction project case study demonstrates the ability of moa-bcde-generated, non-dominated solutions to assist project managers to select an appropriate plan to optimize tcqt, which is an operation that is typically difficult and time-consuming. comparisons between the moa-bcde and four currently used algorithms, including the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (nsga-ii), the multiple objective particle swarm optimization (mopso), the multiple objective differential evolution (mode), and the multiple objective artificial bee colony (moabc), verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

rainwater_harvesting	the present study designed to monitor and predict land cover change (lcc) in addition to characterizing lcc and its dynamics over al-baha region, kingdom of saudi arabia, by utilizing remote sensing and gis-cellular automata model (markov-ca). moreover, to determine the effect of rainwater storage reservoirs as a driver to the expansion of irrigated cropland. eight landsat 5/7 tm/etm images from 1975 to 2010 were analyzed and ultimately utilized in categorizing lc. the lc maps classified into four main classes: bare soil, sparsely vegetated, forest and shrub land, and irrigated cropland. the quantification of lcc for the analyzed categories showed that bare soil and sparsely vegetated was the largest classes throughout the study period, followed by forest, shrubland, and irrigated cropland. the processes of lcc in the study area were not constant, and varied from one class to another. there were two stages in bare soil change, an increase stage (1975-1995) and decline stage (1995-2010), and the construction of 25 rainwater-harvesting dams in the region was the turning point in bare soil change. the greatest increase was observed in irrigated cropland after 1995 in the expense of the other three categories as an effect of extensive rainwater harvesting practices. losses were evident in forest and shrubland and sparsely vegetated land during the first stage (19751995) with 5.4 and 25.6 % of total area in 1995, while in 1975, they covered more than 13.8 and 32.7 % of total area. during the second stage (1995-2010), forest and shrubland witnessed a significant increase from 1569.17 km(2) in 1975 to 1840.87 km(2) in 2010. irrigated cropland underwent the greatest growth (from 422.766 km(2) in 1975 to 1819.931 km(2) in 2010) during the entire study period, and this agriculture expansion reached its zenith in the 2000s. markov-ca simulation in 2050 predicts a continuing upward trend in irrigated cropland and forest and shrubland areas, as well as a downward trend in bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas; the spatial distribution prediction indicates that irrigated cropland will expand around reservoirs and the mountain areas. the validation result showed that the model successfully identified the state of land cover in 2010 with 97 % agreement between the actual and projected cover. the output of this study would be useful for decision makers and lc/land use planners in saudi arabia and similar arid regions.
green_building	purpose - the focus of this paper is on environmental protection, specifically within the context of green building at institutions of higher education (ihes). one major reason why many ihes are not undertaking sustainable building policies is the barriers to adoption. the lack of efficiency caused by these barriers to adoption of campus green building will be examined. the purpose of this paper is to identify the common barriers to adoption of green building initiatives at ihes from multiple stakeholder perspectives and propose possible solutions. design/methodology/approach - the manuscript provides a general review of the lack of efficiency caused by the barriers to adoption of sustainable building policies at tertiary education institutions. findings - campus sustainable building policies face various barriers to adoption of green building policies. campus sustainable building policies face various barriers to adoption. these include lack of awareness among many stakeholders, incentives, champions, understanding of financial considerations, and occupant satisfaction. these barriers can be addressed through review of student perceptions, encouraging knowledge gains at larger wealthier ihes, campus planning, offering financial motivations, employing a campus sustainability officer, and marketing green campus building initiatives. however, every stakeholder needs to be part of the collaboration and incentivized in order to reduce these barriers. practical implications - this manuscript should be helpful to campus community members as they are involved in crafting, implementing, and managing green building policies. as green building development is a contemporary issue among the higher education sector, this research should prove helpful to decision makers as it identifies barriers and solutions to these barriers. furthermore, this research can assist practitioners when attempting to implement green building policies at their respective ihes by helping them understand the barriers as well as potential solutions for these barriers to campus green building. originality/value - this general review uncovers barriers to green building in the higher education sector; a sector which historically is dearth on green building research. furthermore, solutions are offered to address and overcome these barriers from multiple stakeholder perspectives within this sector.
rainwater_harvesting	green roof systems have been suggested to ease the growing urban environmental problems resulting from rapid urbanization. however, the irrigation of green roofs heavily depends on using precious potable water and consequently generates negative environmental effects. rainwater has been recommended to address this dilemma, but the design method has not been well developed. in this study, the major design factors of a rainwater harvesting system for green roof irrigation systems are examined, and a simulation-based mathematical model is established to elucidate the correlation between tank volume and system performance. the optimal system design and probability distribution of the potable water replacement rate are also discussed on the basis of a case study of a university building in keelung, northern taiwan. the results show that the optimal tank volume, potable water replacement rate, and probability of exceedance are 9.41 m(3), 92.72%, and 88.76% (+/- 1sd), respectively. in addition, the economic performance is identified to be feasible. hence, the design method has been verified to be a useful tool to ease the urban environmental issues.
geotextile	this paper describes the conservation of a figurative and geometrical patterned 5th century a. d. mosaic in the ruins of the ""house of the ionic capitals"" in hierapolis, which is one of the world heritage sites. the mosaic had significant quantity of detached and disintegrated tesserae as a result of deterioration of its bedding layer. the conservation process included fixing detached tesserae by reinforcing the bedding layer with lime mortars; integrating disintegrated original tesserae to fill the small lacunae for a better visual perception; mechanical and poultice cleaning; using permeable geotextile in reburial against environmental factors, and herbicide application to prevent plant intrusion.

green_building	this article presents the outcomes of a recent study carried out among engineering professionals and academics in egypt to propose a criteria-based energy efficiency rating system for existing buildings. it discusses the use of a multiple criteria decision making technique, namely the analytic hierarchy process (ahp), for developing the weights of the proposed rating system criteria, and generally reviews the use of ahp to develop building energy rating systems. while the ahp approach of criteria weighting was applied in other countries, the present study distinctively applied it to developing a proposed rating system for existing buildings in egypt. in this study, nine energy rating criteria were identified by thoroughly comparing and analyzing internationally established green building / sustainability rating systems for existing buildings such as leed, breeam, green globes, energy star, igbc and pearl rating system for estidama. a survey was then conducted to collect the opinions of egyptian engineering professionals regarding the relative priority of the identified criteria, and to determine, according to the opinions of participants, which criteria are mandatory and which are optional for existing buildings seeking to become 'greener'. using alip, weights were developed for the optional criteria, representing their relative importance. based on the performed analysis, the resulting rating criteria are: one mandatory prerequisite, which is the minimum energy performance, and eight optional credits with descending relative weights, which are: use of renewable energy sources, building envelope efficiency strategies, use of energy efficient appliances and equipment, building systems automation and controllability, eco-friendly refrigerants & fire suppression systems, operation and maintenance practices, metering and sub-metering of building, zones and systems and finally building-related transportation impact.
construction_management	the project delivery system (pds) is the key means by which the owner creates preconditions for successful realization of a project. thus, it is worthwhile finding out which systems are used in different instances. this paper aims to increase general knowledge in this area first by introducing the results of an analysis of data on more than forty thousand new building construction projects launched in finland between 1989 and 2013. annual shares of different pdss are determined separately for residential, industrial and business premises, as well as other buildings - mainly public service buildings. the paper also sheds light on changes in the market structure to the extent that they influence the use of different pdss in order to discover the key factors which could possibly hamper making conclusions about general trends in, and the impact of the economic situation on, the selection a pds for a project. as to the results, the study shows that the separate contracts method is used the most while the share of construction management is the smallest. in-house construction, design-build and the traditional comprehensive contract are other systems used whose shares fall between the above two extremes. changes in market structure over time most likely influence the use of different pdss in housing construction.

rainwater_harvesting	this paper examines determinants of adoption of rainwater harvesting and conservation techniques in semi-arid tharaka sub-county, eastern kenya. given the erratic rainfall that characterises tharaka, rainwater harvesting and conservation is critical for the improvement of agricultural production. the study was conducted in two agro-ecological zones, and 196 respondents were interviewed. the majority of the farmers were practising between 1-3 and 4-6 rainwater harvesting and conservation techniquesan indication of the awareness of the benefits. in situ technologies were more frequently practised than micro-catchment and macro-catchment technologies. there were institutional efforts supporting adoption of micro-catchment and macro-catchment techniques in the recent past. correlation results showed that the number of techniques practised was influenced by the number of years spent in school, arable land size, labour availability and number of livelihood options. soil quality is an unlikely determinant of rainwater harvesting because a majority of the farmers rated it as good and fair. chi-squared results suggest that choice of rainwater techniques is primarily informed by a desire to harvest and conserve soil moisture than to improve soil quality. although adoption of these technologies is encouraging, assessment of their efficiency in the context of physical attributes such as soil characteristics, slope and rainfall amount of the area would add value. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
geotextile	geosynthetics is the umbrella term for thin, flexible material sheets applied in civil and environmental engineering, of which geotextiles form the largest group. most geotextiles consist of a polymer from the polyolefin, polyester or polyamide family, and additives to improve their stability. the polymer may degrade into microplastic particles over time and under various conditions and can cause adverse effects, as species may ingest these particles or encounter adverse effects due to the interference of the particles with e.g. their photosynthesis system in the case of algae. leaching of additives may occur from the intact material, as they are often not covalently bound to the polymer backbone, but is greatly enhanced when micro-sized plastic particles have been formed. a total of 42 polymer additives were identified, of which 26 had ecotoxicity information available in terms of a reach persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation (pbt) assessment. of these, 15 were classified as (very) persistent and 2 as toxic. a survey to assess potential toxicity of the remaining 16 substances revealed that no ecotoxicity studies had been performed on 13 of these compounds. for 3 compounds, other toxicity data was found, as well as of several chemical groups known to be used as additives in geotextiles. the current knowledge is thus lacking in two domains: on the one hand, ecotoxicity data is scarce as many substances have not yet been the subject of ecotoxicological studies. on the other hand, in situ toxic effects might be missed by the current approach of single compound toxicity testing. moreover, environmental occurrence data of the additives are extremely scarce.

green_building	a miniaturized thin film transparent ultrawideband (uwb) antenna design with a band notch is presented. a pair of split-ring resonators (srrs) is placed besides the radiating element to realize the band notch centered at 5.5 ghz. the proposed transparent antenna covers the whole 3.1 to 10.6 ghz uwb frequency band with a notch from 5 to 6 ghz to isolate interferences from wireless local area network (wlan) and dedicated short-range communication (dsrc) applications. the transparency of this antenna of up to 80% is enabled by the fabrication on a conductive silver coated thin film (aght-8). hence, the proposed transparent antenna is a suitable for uwb home entertainment network (ieee 1394 over uwb network) for green building applications, where high data rates are required for multimedia transfer. implementation of the proposed transparent antenna will reduce the space consumption due to its very low thickness and low profile, while at the same time increasing the aesthetic values of the installed wireless system due to its high transparency.
smart_material	fe3o4-au hybrid nanoparticles (hnps) have shown increasing potential for biomedical applications such as image guided stimuli responsive drug delivery. incorporation of the unique properties of hnps into thermally responsive scaffolds holds great potential for future biomedical applications. here we successfully fabricated smart scaffolds based on thermo-responsive poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (pnipam). nanoparticles providing localized trigger of heating when irradiated with a short laser burst were found to give rise to remote control of bulk polymer shrinkage. gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using wet chemical precipitation methods followed by electrochemical coating. after subsequent functionalization of particles with allyl methyl sulfide, mercaptodecane, cysteamine and poly(ethylene glycol) thiol to enhance stability, detailed biological safety was determined using live/dead staining and cell membrane integrity studies through lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) quantification. the peg coated hnps did not show significant cytotoxic effect or adverse cellular response on exposure to 7f2 cells (p < 0.05) and were carried forward for scaffold incorporation. the pnipam-hnp composite scaffolds were investigated for their potential as thermally triggered systems using a q-switched nd:yag laser. these studies show that incorporation of hnps resulted in scaffold deformation after very short irradiation times (seconds) due to internal structural heating. our data highlights the potential of these hybrid-scaffold constructs for exploitation in drug delivery, using methylene blue as a model drug being released during remote structural change of the scaffold.
geotextile	this paper describes an experimental investigation of the load-settlement behaviour of a model strip footing resting on a reinforced homogeneous sand bed for several embedment depths at medium-dense to very dense states of sand. the reinforcement is a single-layer woven geotextile layer without and with wraparound ends at a depth of 0.3b from the base of the footing of width b. a particular focus of this study is the effect of wraparound ends of the reinforcement on the load-bearing capacity. the experimental results of the study are compared with numerical findings from a finite-element analysis carried out using the plaxis 2d software. the study shows there is a significant improvement in both the load-bearing capacity and the stiffness of the sand bed with increasing footing embedment depth as well as with the provision of wraparound ends of the reinforcement. the numerical results follow the experimental results closely for the lower settlement values. the results presented in graphical form in this paper can be used as general guidelines for practical conditions similar to those considered in the present study.
ambient_intelligence	this article examines face recognition as a key instance of the emergence of smart photography. smart photography, drawing on artificial intelligence (ai) and ambient intelligence (ami) manifests a 'habit of mind' (karen barad), or a way of thinking that is humanist in so far as it is predicated on human and machine autonomy, and representationalist in its quest for unmediated objects-in-themselves. faces are among the objects that smart photography seeks (autonomously) to represent. by examining two of the principal algorithms of face recognition technology, the article will show how ways of seeing allied to ways of thinking that are also, ultimately, discriminatory and essentialist, materialise through software. finally, if the 'smart' in smart photography means learning to discriminate between classes of faces that are fixed, essentialised and ultimately elusive (the stereotypical face of terror is both gendered and racialised) then how could smart be made smarter? this is a question of politics rather than progress.
geotextile	this paper presents a laboratory evaluation of purely frictionally connected geotextile and concrete facing block of mechanically stabilized earth wall (msew) systems. the study focuses on investigating the governing failure mechanism along the wall face, as determined from the pullout of reinforcement in between the facing blocks (herein referred as pullout mechanism) and sliding of the blocks over the geotextile, where the reinforcement stays stationery (herein referred as direct shear mechanism). a total of seventy-two tests were performed to investigate the effect of laboratory specimen size, difference in geotextile reinforcement, and repeatability of the test results. overall, the results showed that at lower normal loads, sliding of the blocks over the geotextile reinforcement along the wall face is more likely to occur before the pullout of the geotextile in between the blocks. at higher normal loads, this order is reversed and pullout of the geotextile appears to occur first. the test results also indicated that the size of the specimen tested in the laboratory frictional connection evaluation has an effect on the measured connection strength. published by elsevier ltd.
stealth_technology	the development of new sensor systems able to detect, identify and find position of the targets equipped with stealth technology began early in 1990s. some of the sensor systems utilise acoustic, magnetic, seismic and/or other physical effects of target activity. a reason motivating the development of new sensor systems based on other than radar or optical principal of operation in detecting targets is that the systems usually emit no electromagnetic energy during operation. thanks to their passive principle they provide the users with the advantages of hidden positioning and difficult discovery with reconnaissance tools. therefore, some of the new ugs systems also allow detecting low-flying targets, such as helicopters, propeller or jet aircraft, etc., in the detection range of up to several kilometres. the information of flight direction is usually estimated and deduced from spatiotemporal sequence detections by multiple interlinked ugs systems. the submitted paper analyses low-flying target position finding principle on time direction of arrival (tdoa) basis. it presents the qualities of found ugs arrangement topologies and the characteristics of the unambiguous position determination of low-flying targets. it also contains mathematical description of signal digital processing intended to find low-flying target 's position. the processed results are presented in table and diagram forms created in matlab mathematical environment. all the presented detection and identification results were obtained from real recorded signals.
smart_material	lead zirconate titanate (pzt) microwires with applications in sensors, actuators, and energy harvesters are produced using hydrothermal synthesis. the synthesized microwires are relatively large with an average length of about 450 microns and an average width of 4 microns. each of these individual pzt microwires can be integrated in smart systems as an active phase or be used as an independent smart material. in this paper, the synthesis procedure and characterization of these large microwires is demonstrated. the converse piezoelectric properties of the microwires are measured using digital image correlation after clamping and adding electrodes at each end of the microwire. it has been shown in the literature that digital image correlation can be used as a precise tool for rapid characterization of piezoelectric materials. here, it is demonstrated that this technique can be applied to characterize the actual response of piezoelectric materials at the micron scale.
smart_material	the iron(ii) complex with 4-amino-1,2,4 triazole (nh2-trz) ligand has potential applications as smart material since the compounds show a distinct color change from lilac at low temperature to colorless at high temperature. the lilac color of the complex represent the diamagnetic low spin state while the colorless correspond to the paramagnetic high spin state of iron(ii). the transition between the two states could be tuned by changing the anionic group. generally, the complex was synthesized directly from aqueous solution of iron(ii) salt with considerable amounts of nh2-trz solution produced solid powder compound. for application as an electronic molecular device, the complex should be obtained as a thin film. the transparent [fe(nh(2)trz)(3)]-nafion film has been successfully obtained, however, no anion variation can be produced since the nation is an anionic resin. in this work, the [fe(nh(2)trz)(3)]-complexes with several anions have been synthesized inside nolo de coco membrane that commonly used as a medium for deposition metal nano-particles. after drying the membrane containing the complex became a thin film at room temperature, the film containing iron(ii) complexes of sulphate and nitrate salts show lilac color, similar to that of the original complexes in the powder form. on heating, the color of the complex film changed to colorless and this color change was observed reversibly. in contrast, the films containing perchlorate and tetrafluoroborate iron(ii) complexes are colorless at room temperature and changed to lilac on cooling. the significant color changing of the iron(ii)complexes in the nata de cow film can be used for demonstration thermo chromic effect of smart materials with relatively small amount of the compounds.
suspension_bridge	timely and correctly evaluating the quality of global positioning system (gps) data is essential for reduction in the number of false alarms and missed detection of a gps-based bridge deformation monitoring system. this paper investigates how to use the statistical process control technique, known as the cumulative sum (cusum) chart, for the detection of small but persistent shifts in the high-rate gps carrier-phase measurements. first, a mathematical model for the shift detection based on the continuous hypothesis testing is established. the main features and implementation procedure of the cusum chart for the shift detection are then summarized, and the corresponding parameter selection method is discussed in detail. to meet the normality requirement of the cusum chart, a novel method that transfers the data to the q-statistic by the estimated cumulative distribution functions is proposed according to the probability integral transform theory. this is followed by a simulation carried out to evaluate the detection performance of the cusum chart and exploit its advantages to the commonly used shewhart chart for the high-rate gps monitoring data with different shift sizes. experimental results have showed that the cusum chart is sensitive to small persistent shifts compared to the shewhart chart although it has a delay problem. the integration of cusum chart and shewhart chart would be a reliable approach for the shift detection. finally, an on-site dynamic monitoring experiment is carried out on a long-span bridge to validate the proposed approach 's effectiveness in detecting an actual deformation shift, and the experimental results proved to be very encouraging.
solar_energy	catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (oer) play an important role in the conversion of solar energy to fuel of earth-abundant water into h-2 and o-2 through splitting/electrolysis. heterogeneous electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (her and oer) exhibit catalytic activity that depends on the electronic properties, oxidation states, and local surface structure. spinel ferrites (mfe2o4; m = ni and co) based materials have been attractive for the catalytic water oxidation due to their well-known stability in alkaline medium, easy synthesis, existence of metal cations with various oxidation states, low cost, and tunable properties by the desired metal substitution. to understand the better catalytic activity of mfe2o4 in detail the role of ni and co was studied through mxni1-xfe2o4 (m = co; 0 < x < 1), which was prepared by the sol-gel method. the results showed that bare nife2o4 has better catalytic activity (eta = 381 mv at 10 ma cm(-2) and tafel slope of 46.4 mv dec(-1)) compared to co-containing mxni1-xfe2o4 (eta = 450-470 mv at 10 ma cm(-2) and tafel slope of 50-73 mv dec(-1)) in alkaline medium, and the substitution of co is found to suppress the catalytic activity of nife2o4. the degradation of catalytic activity with an increase in co content was accounted for in further detailed investigations.
water_pollution	water pollution by organic compounds is one of the major challenges faced by industries that use dyeing processes. thus, some methods were developed for degrading dyes in wastewaters, including heterogeneous photocatalysis by semiconductor oxides. however, these oxides have limited photocatalytic activity due to the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. the aim of this study is the use of a carbon nanotube (cnt) and tio2-zno oxide junction from modified sol-gel method to promote the degradation of organic dye through the photocatalytic activity of these nanocomposites. tio2-zno/cnt nanocomposites were studied by x-ray diffraction (xrd), transmission electron microscope (tem), scanning electron microscope (sem) and photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes. the results of photocatalysis show up to 60% the efficiency of the samples in the removal of dye.

water_pollution	water pollution has become a global problem and its impact on the health of the human population is growing day by day. this study aims to assess the pollution of the cibin river (romania) by a physicochemical analysis. water samples have been collected from four locations along the cibin river over a period of 12 months. at this time, there are several commonly used multiple-criteria decision analysis (mcda) methods for the assessing the impact of pollutants on the environment. in this research, we used the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) multi-criteria method to evaluate each sampling station 's physicochemical parameters. the significant results place the river in the first (sampling stations 1, 2 and 3) and second (sampling stations 4) water quality classes. another significant result of this work is that the research using gis software allowed an integrated automatic data collection system and displays interactive results.
ambient_intelligence	in this paper, we discuss the development of an ambient intelligent-based system for the monitoring of dementia patients living in their own homes. within this system groups of unobtrusive wireless sensor devices can be deployed at specific locations within a patient 's home and accessed via standardized interfaces provided through an open middleware platform. for each sensor group intelligent agents are used to learn fuzzy rules, which model the patient 's habitual behaviours in the environment. an online rule adaptation technique is applied to facilitate short-term tuning of the learnt behaviours, and long-term tracking of behaviour changes which could be due to the effects of cognitive decline caused from dementia. the proposed system reports macro level behaviour changes and micro level perception drift to care providers to enable them to make better-informed assessments of the patient 's cognitive abilities and changing care needs. we demonstrate experiments in a real pervasive computing environment, in which our intelligent agent approach can learn to model the user 's behaviours and allow online adaptation of its model to better approximate the learnt behaviours and identify long-term macro-level behaviour changes, which could be attributed to cognitive decline. we also show an example of how the user 's perceptions for thermal comfort may be captured and visualised to provide a means by which micro-level perception changes can be monitored.
geotextile	the creep curve of geosynthetic assays requires very long time, socalled conventional tests. to reduce this time can be used the sim teste (stepped isothermal method) known as accelerated test. this paper presents the results of accelerated and conventional tests to assess the creep of geotextile non-woven polyester with short fiber. compared to the literature, the results showed less variability of the temporal range of the accelerated creep curves.
geotextile	with rapid growth in population, it becomes difficult to control the huge amount of residual materials generated from enormous industrial activities. the residuals that are not recycled, reclaimed or reused constitute the wastes only to get released to the environment. as some of the wastes cannot be assimilated by the environment, those can become hazardous for the environment quality and ensure pollution. this paper expresses the concern on two such industrial wastes, used plastic water bottles and fly ash. the present study emphasizes on the reuse of used waste plastic water bottles in the civil engineering applications and in this regard, it discusses the previous work by dutta and mandal (2013). two different type plastic water bottles, having different diameter and tensile stiffness, were chosen to prepare perforated cells of different heights wrapped with jute geotextile from inner side so that fine infill materials cannot escape from the perforations. laboratory strain controlled compression tests were carried out on the cells rested over a rigid base and filled with compacted fly ash or stone aggregates. test results showed significant load carrying capacity of the composite cells with fly ash as infill material. though fine fly ash appeared to be an effective infill material, use of coarse stone aggregates as infill material produced better load carrying capacity of the composite cells. it was also observed that with reduction in cell height over the rigid base, load carrying capacity of the composite cells got increased. the study confirmed that plastic bottles with suitable infill material can act as an ideal compression member.

rainwater_harvesting	groundwater reservoirs are important water resources all over the world. especially, they are of utmost significance for arid and semi-arid regions, and therefore, a sustainable exploitation of these reservoirs needs to be ensured. the natural and most exclusive water supplier to groundwater reservoirs in saudi arabia is rainfall, which is characterized by sporadic and random temporal and spatial distributions, particularly under the impacts of climate change; giving rise to uncertainty in groundwater recharge quantification. although in saudi arabia, intense and frequent rainfall events are rare, but they generate significant flash floods with huge amounts of surface water. under such circumstances, any simple but effective water storage augmentation facility such as rainwater harvesting (rwh) structures gain vital importance for sustainability of water supply and survivals in arid and semi-arid regions. the objective of this study is to explore the possibility of rwh over a basin in the western province of saudi arabia called wadi al-lith under climate change. climatic data is obtained from the ipcc ar5 gcms, which is further downscaled using a regional climate model regcm4 for the arabian peninsula domain. the regcm4 is driven to simulate climatic parameters including rainfall at 25 km grid resolution for the present climate (1971-2000), and future climate (2006-2099) with representative concentration pathways, rcp4.5 and rcp8.5. results indicate that more durable and longer wet durations are expected with increasing surplus rainfall amounts in the far future because of climate change impacts. consequently, future climate scenarios are expected to enhance floods and flash floods occurrences, which call for progressive measures to harness the rwh opportunity.

suspension_bridge	the temperature field variation law and distribution characteristics of an orthotropic flat steel box girder under sunny conditions were analyzed through a field temperature test on the steel box girder of the operational runyang yangtze river bridge (the suspension bridge part). function optimization fitting and error analysis of the test data were conducted. a temperature gradient distribution curve applicable to a hexagonal flat steel box girder was proposed. based on the measurement results, the temperature effect of an orthotropic flat steel box girder was analyzed using finite element method and the effects of different temperature gradient modes on the mechanical characteristics and stress distribution of the steel box girder were compared. under sunny conditions, heat conduction in the flat steel box girder structure shows distinct ""box-room effect"" characteristics, and the actual temperature gradient distribution is inconsistent with the one suggested by the existing standards. the thermal stress of a steel box girder calculated from the measured temperature gradient mode exceeds that calculated from the standard, and the intensity approximates that under the action of designed vehicle loads. the temperature-induced stress is distributed centrally near the manufacturing welds of the orthotropic steel box girder, which should be considered in design, construction and research. results from this study could supplement the existing bridge and culvert design standards.
solar_energy	the variability of solar energy in off-grid systems dictates the sizing of energy storage systems along with the sizing and scheduling of loads present in the off-grid system. unfortunately, energy storage may be costly, while frequent switching of loads in the absence of an energy storage system causes wear and tear and should be avoided. yet, the amount of solar energy utilized should be maximized and the problem of finding the optimal static load size of a finite number of discrete electric loads on the basis of a load response optimization is considered in this paper. the objective of the optimization is to maximize solar energy utilization without the need for costly energy storage systems in an off-grid system. conceptual and real data for solar photovoltaic power production provides the power input to the off-grid system. given the number of units, the following analytical solutions and computational algorithms are proposed to compute the optimal load size of each unit: mixed-integer linear programming and constrained least squares. based on the available solar power profile, the algorithms select the optimal on/off switch times and maximize solar energy utilization by computing the optimal static load sizes. the effectiveness of the algorithms is compared using one year of solar power data from san diego, california and thuwal, saudi arabia. it is shown that the annual system solar energy utilization is optimized to 73% when using two loads and can be boosted up to 98% using a six load configuration.

smart_material	sintered polycrystalline cobalt ferrite is a potential magnetostrictive smart material for applications as sensors and actuators. a novel concept of enhancing the magnetostrictive strain of sintered cobalt ferrite by making self-composites from nanosized and bulk powders with different particle sizes of the same material as components is reported. the self-composites give higher magnetostriction coefficient and strain derivative when compared to the sintered products obtained from the individual powders. the individual components give a maximum magnetostriction up to similar to 310 ppm, whereas up to similar to 370 ppm is obtained for a two-component system consisting of powders of two different sizes. on the other hand, a three-component self-composite made from starting powders of 3 nm, 40 nm and >1 mu m give very high magnetostriction of similar to 400 ppm at 800 ka/m, suitable for making devices.
rainwater_harvesting	arid and semi-arid regions around the world face water scarcity problems due to lack of precipitation and unpredictable rainfall patterns. for thousands of years, rainwater harvesting (rwh) techniques have been applied to cope with water scarcity. researchers have used many different methodologies for determining suitable sites and techniques for rwh. however, limited attention has been given to the evaluation of rwh structure performance. the aim of this research was to design a scientifically-based, generally applicable methodology to better evaluate the performance of existing rwh techniques in (semi-) arid regions. the methodology integrates engineering, biophysical and socio-economic criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) supported by the geographic information system (gis). jessour/tabias are the most traditional rwh techniques in the oum zessar watershed in south-eastern tunisia, which were used to test this evaluation tool. fifty-eight rwh locations (14 jessr and 44 tabia) in three main sub-catchments of the watershed were assessed and evaluated. based on the criteria selected, more than 95% of the assessed sites received low or moderate suitability scores, with only two sites receiving high suitability scores. this integrated methodology, which is highly flexible, saves time and costs, is easy to adapt to different regions and can support designers and decision makers aiming to improve the performance of existing and new rwh sites.
water_pollution	abundance and seasonal trophodynamics (specific growth rate, daily production, and grazing mortality) of the major picophytoplankton components, synechococcus cyanobacteria (syn) and picoeukaryotes (pico-e), were studied at three stations in sevastopol bay and adjacent coastal waters (the black sea) in 2014 by flow cytometry and the dilution method. pico-e abundance was shown to increase along the nutrient and pollution gradient from the coastal waters outside the bay (annual average of 7.3 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) to the eastern corner of the bay (28.7 +/- 11.4 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)), while no relation was found between the water pollution status and syn abundance (9.9 +/- 8.7 x 10(3) cells ml(-1); at all the stations, n = 27). matter flows through the communities (daily production for syn and pico-e 0(-1)6.6 and 0(-1)9.3 a mu g c l-1 day(-1), respectively; grazing mortality for syn and picoe 0-3.6 and 0-21.2 a mu g c l-1 day(-1), respectively) were comparable to or even exceeded their biomass stocks (>0.05-6.8 and 0.9-26.5 a mu g c l-1 for syn and picoe, respectively), indicating high biomass turnover rates. the highest flow-to-stock ratio (up to 6 for syn) and a significant imbalance between daily production (p) and grazing mortality (g) were observed in the most polluted and eutrophic waters of the bay in spring (pico-e: p/g1). black river inflow to the bay was hypothesized to be among the mechanisms maintaining this pronounced and long-term imbalance in the open system without any negative consequences for the picophytoplankton assemblages.
green_building	with the increasing capabilities of computer modeling and simulation technology, the analysis of options for maximizing gains in energy efficiency for buildings can be realized more efficiently and cost effectively. conducting building performance simulations allows for the analysis of the environmental impacts of buildings and the economic vitality of green building techniques. commercial buildings consume nearly one-fifth of all the energy used in the united states, costing more than $200 billion each year. the building envelope plays a key role in determining how much energy is required for the operation of a building. individual thermal and solar properties of glazing and shading systems only provide information based on static evaluations, but it is very important to assess the efficiency of these systems as a whole assembly under site-specific conditions. this paper presents a case study that was conducted using computer simulation tools to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of using different types of glazing-sunshade systems on the overall performance of an office building in florida. the case study results show how early stage building performance studies using computer simulation tools help practitioners in achieving the goals of reduced energy consumption and increased indoor comfort in an economical manner.

suspension_bridge	for oblique arch, curved beam, space oblique composite system of suspension bridge, whose force transmission path and spatial stress is complex, robustness characteristics is strong, and no engineering experience can be used for reference. in order to analyse wind resistant performance of the tongtai bridge, the aeroelastic model of the bridge is designed and fabricated by accurately simulating the flow field in the boundary layer of the field and using wind tunnel test technique, calculated vortex vibration, buffeting and aerodynamic stability of the arch-rib and whole bridge under uniform flow field and turbulent flow field at different attack angle, angle condition. the experimental results show that the bridge has good aerodynamic stability and no obvious vortex vibration occurs. the vertical and lateral displacement of the arch rib 1/4 section is higher than that of the crown, but it meets the requirement of wind resistance.
construction_management	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing defaults and exits from public works by prime contractors of small and medium-sized enterprises in the japanese construction industry. by analysing the data for several years as panel data, this study determines the extent of influence of changes in company characteristics on the defaults and exits. design/methodology/approach - using construction company evaluation (keiei jikou sinsa or keisin) data and by employing the panel binary logit random effect model, this study empirically analyses the construction industry. findings - this study shows that defaulting and exiting companies have different characteristics. the result shows financial performance indicators, non-financial performance indicators and keisin scores to significantly affect defaults and exits. in particular, this study finds non- financial performance indicators, such as whether a firm draws insurance, to significantly affect its likelihood to default or exit and the influence varies on the basis of insurance type. originality/value - the feature of this study is that its analysis focuses not only on defaulting companies but also on exiting companies, defined as those that stop operating as prime contractors for public works but otherwise stay in business. in contrast to existing research, this study distinguishes between defaults and exits and analyses the factors that influence a firm following one of these two outcomes. moreover, although keisin data are usually used to determine whether companies qualify to enter bids for public works, they can be applied for an attribution analysis of corporate defaults and exits.
construction_management	the paper presents new technology on polish market - bim. nowadays method of project management and construction did not change for many decades. traditionally, all information were handed over in the form of flat drawings: sketches, graphics, technical drawings and nowadays in program generated visualizations. documentation form has involved, but it was always two-dimensional. over last years, the new conception has raised, which base on changing the technology of design. bim - building information modeling is one the most latest and important technologies for architecture, civil engineering and construction management. information are handed over in the form of three dimensional model which consists of separated models. they are characterized by parameters such as: mass, length, layer, level, phase of construction process when element is used or produced. in other words, they are ideal illustration of components, which are built in to building. this way the reliable virtual copy of building is created.

construction_management	the goal of this paper is to formalize and validate a model in order to determine a pay adjustment on the basis of mechanical and functional performance of transportation infrastructures. a model to determine the pay adjustment based on life expectancy of a pavement and the variability of its main properties was formulated. five different paths and points of view are used in order to obtain information on model suitability and robustness. an algorithm has been proposed to estimate a pay adjustment (pa, negative or positive), based on life cycle cost analysis, when both structural and non-structural deficiencies/surplus in characteristics are detected. the five different methodologies, used for deriving pa, demonstrate the validity of the model in which the pa depends on both position and dispersion measures. it has been demonstrated that the model can help in analysing a project and construction management under a common framework. analyses and validation demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently overcome typical problems in pa determination and in contract administration, where decisions based upon objective and sound criteria are needed. both practitioners and researchers are expected to benefit from the outcomes of this study.
stealth_technology	a perfect metamaterial absorber is realized and its properties are theoretically, numerically and experimentally investigated at microwave frequencies. in addition, polarization and incident angle independencies are also tested for the structure. theoretical, numerical and experimental results show that the proposed model has many advantages compared to those in the literature, such as perfect absorption, polarization and incident angle independencies, very simple design, and operation over a sufficiently wide band. a simple configuration is chosen for the proposed model so that it can be easily tuned for other frequency regimes to realize new absorbers for applications such as sensors and stealth technology.
smart_material	a novel ""dynamic ligament"" smart material that exhibits a strongly rate-dependent response in extension is developed and characterized. the devices, based on elastomeric polymers and shear thickening fluids, exhibit low resistance to extension at rates below 10 mm/s, but when stretched at 100 mm/s or higher resist with up to 7x. higher force. a link between the shear thickening fluid 's rheology and the dynamic ligament 's tensile performance is presented to explain the rate-dependent response. future recommendations for improving device performance are presented, along with a host of different potential application areas including safety equipment, adaptive braces, sporting goods, and military equipment.
remote_sensing	snow accumulation, ablation, and runoff in mountainous areas are critical components of the hydrologic cycle, but are poorly known. passive microwave (pm) measurements are sensitive to snow water equivalent (swe), even in mountain regions, but vegetation masks the microwave signals and reduces this sensitivity. this study examines how the pm snow signal is affected by the forest density in fourteen basins in the sierra nevada, usa, and in a series of sixteen subsets of the kern basin that have varied vegetation density. 36.5 ghz vertical polarization brightness temperature (t-b) time series for each basin were produced from the spaceborne amsr-e operational period (water year (wy) 2003 to wy2011). for each basin, the coefficient of determination (r-2) between the annual minimum tb and the concurrent swe was calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the pm to swe. the relationship between the r-2 values and the forest density was then analyzed to assess how vegetation affect the swe information in the observed tb. mean forest coverage from modis was used to represent forest density. the r2 between the annual minimum tb and concurrent swe was >0.6 for three of the basins. consistent with previous studies, wy2006 demonstrated anomalous tb values for many basins, apparently due to anomalous warm winter rainfall. excluding wy2006, r-2 is significantly higher in all basins: eight of fourteen basins have r-2 >0.6. for basins with average elevation >2500 m, swe correlates well with tb. the r-2 decreases monotonically with decreasing elevation. basin elevation and forest cover are highly correlated in the sierra; a basin elevation of 2500 m generally coincides with forest cover of 20%. a total of 42% of sierra nevada has <20% forest cover; this corresponds to an estimated 34% of the total swe in the sierra. thus, swe and tb are empirically correlated for over a third of the swe in the sierra, typically at high elevations and above treeline.

water_pollution	a steam gasification processes is an energy conversion pathway through which organic materials are converted to useful energy. in spite of the high energy content in organic waste materials, they have been mostly disposed of in landfills, which causes harmful environmental issues such as methane emissions and ground water pollution and contaminations. in this sense, organic solid waste materials are regarded as alternative resources for conversion to useful energy in the steam gasification process. in this study, three types of waste materials - municipal solid waste (msw), used tires and sewage sludge - were used to generate syngas through the gasification process in a 1000 degrees c steam atmosphere. the syngas generation rates and its chemical compositions were measured and evaluated over time to determine the characteristics and dynamics of the gasification process. also, carbon conversion, and mass and energy balances are presented which demonstrates the feasibility of steam gasification as a waste conversion pathway. the results show that the syngas contains high concentrations of h-2, around 41-55% by volume. the syngas generation rate was found to depend on the carbon content in the feedstock regardless of the types of input materials. comparing to the hydrogen production from water splitting that requires extremely high temperatures at around 1500 degrees c, hydrogen production by steam gasification of organic materials can be regarded as equally effective but requires lower system temperatures. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
rainwater_harvesting	with an insightful policy, rainwater harvesting (rwh) can be promoted as a core adaptation strategy for achieving global water security, reaching the millennium development goals (mdgs) and sustaining water resources. the microbial and chemical quality of rwh samples collected from tanks in a sustainable housing development in kleinmond, south africa, were monitored. results indicated that the tank water quality was within all the chemical standards (cations and anions) analysed for potable water. however, the counts of the indicator organisms, for example, total coliforms and escherichia coli, exceeded the guidelines stipulated by the department of water affairs and forestry (1996). the microbial analysis results thus indicate that the tank water was not fit for potable use without treatment. a social research project was then conducted to describe, amongst others, the condition of the tank and the users' knowledge of the rwh system. in addition, demographic data, viz., gender, household size and employment status, etc., were gathered in order to provide a socioeconomic background description of the study population. data were gathered by means of face-to-face interviews with 68 respondents. generally, rwh was used for washing clothes and for cleaning inside and outside the houses. this study noted that without acceptance and necessary training to maintain and use the tank optimally, it is possible that social development projects, such as the one in kleinmond, will not be sustainable.
solar_energy	a first of its kind pilot-scale redox-based thermochemical storage system has been set up and operated under near-realistic conditions inside a solar power tower plant. the storage unit is made of inert honeycomb supports (cordierite) coated with 88 kg of redox active material (cobalt oxide). an experimental campaign has been carried out consisting of 22 thermochemical charge-discharge cycles. the heat absorbed or released by the chemical reaction became clearly evident through the temperature evolution inside the reactive material. it allows to store or release energy at constant temperature when crossing respectively the reduction/oxidation temperature of the co3o4/coo pair. a storage performance factor (p-f) was defined to evaluate how each experiment approaches the ideal behavior. during the complete campaign no measurable cycle-to-cycle degradation was observed and the system average capacity was very close to the ideal case of p-f = 0.84. the advantage of thermochemical storage could be quantified by comparing the storage capacity, to that of a sensible-only storage unit made of uncoated cordierite honeycombs. the thermochemical system offered almost double storage capacity (47.0 kw h) cf. the same volume of the sensible-only case (25.3 kw h).

solar_energy	the small wavelength utilizable range used for determining the optimum performance of photovoltaic and rectenna devices, compared to the broad band spectrum of solar or other heat sources, limits the energy conversion efficiency of such technologies. a selective emitter, with an emissivity profile that matches the receiver 's characteristic bandwidth, can be used to improve the overall efficiency of such energy harvesting devices. this paper dompares simulated and experimental results of the design and fabrication of a selective emitter that can be used in the 8-12 mu m frequency range. the matrix transform method is used to calculate the radiative properties of one dimensional metal-dielectric photonic structures. by using genetic algorithm as a powerful optimization tool, the simulated design characteristics of such structure are adjusted to minimize the mean square deviation of the actual spectral emissivity from the target emissivity profile. specifically, this paper presents and compares results of the simulated design and fabrication of selective emitters composed of alternating layers of al2o3-sio2 or al2o3-sic on an aluminum substrate. the output radiation of these selective emitters could be used as the input radiation to high efficiency rectenna devices.
solar_energy	in this paper, we report electrosynthesized cadmium sulfide (cds) thin films for the electron beam irradiation and solar cell application. deposited and irradiated cds thin films are characterized for their structural, surface, morphological, and electrical properties by xrd, fe-sem, and photoelectrochemical cell measurement. we have confirmed that the optical and photoelectrochemical properties can be improved by irradiation treatment. this work is useful for surface tailoring and providing a novel approach to improve photoelectrochemical properties of nanostructured cds thin films for the promising applications in nano system devices to convert solar energy. the maximum efficiency and fill factor are found to be 1.8% and 0.49 at 25 kgy, respectively.
green_building	green building practices have created an opportunity for the forest products industry to become a leader in the creation of innovative building products derived from renewable materials. in other industries, sandwich composites have proven to be efficient structures by meeting structural demands of traditional panel products while consuming less material. a prototype molded-core sandwich panel made of span-rated oriented strand board (osb) facings and a bidirectional molded wood-strand core was produced. critical mechanical properties were evaluated to determine the feasibility of this product for use in building applications. the goals of this study were to generate details on structural performance of the product, validate the design, and provide suggestions for future product development. results indicate that this molded-core panel performs particularly well in flexure while connection properties had the largest scope for improvement. sufficient performance was observed to validate the design, warranting production and testing of panels sized for end-use. future product development should explore different connection systems, perform detailed engineering analyses of the mechanical properties necessary for complete structural design, and characterize physical properties of the panel.
construction_management	automated compliance checking (acc) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (bims). however, current industry foundation classes (ifc)-based bims provide limited support for acc, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (cc). in this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the ifc schema to incorporate cc-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. the method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to cc (e. g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the ifc class hierarchy. the proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from cc-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related ifc concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related ifc concepts. the proposed method enables the extension of the ifc schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. to test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the international building code (ibc) 2006 and 2009. chapter 12 of ibc 2006 was used for training/development and chapter 19 of ibc 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7% f1-measure, 84.5% adoption rate, and 87.9% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, ifc concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively.

solar_energy	the energy for the solvent regeneration of post-combustion carbon capture (pcc) process is typically provided by steam bleeding from the power plant (pp) steam cycle. the energy penalty for steam bleeding results in serious reduction in the pp capacity estimated to be in the range of 10-40%. power plant repowering or hybridization using solar-assisted pcc (spcc) is a promising approach to satisfy carbon capture targets as well as pp load, concurrently. the drawback of this methodology is that notable amounts of solar energy are wasted during heat transfer from solar radiation to rich solvent. this paper presents a novel approach by eliminating the costly desorber system and using solar collector pipe (i.e. parabolic trough pipe) to directly heat the rich solvent and disassociate the bonds of co2-solvent. this novel technology lowers the process capital expenditure, and also reduces the solvent regeneration energy bringing it close to its theoretical values. the elimination of the complex desorber column also increases the flexibility of the pp operation in response for market dynamics. a case-study for sydney-australia shows that in comparison with spcc methodology, this state-of-the-art approach could notably improve the economics of the process and reduce the size of solar collector field (scf).

water_pollution	water erosion causes soil degradation and nonpoint pollution. pollutants are primarily transported on the surfaces of fine soil and sediment particles. several soil loss models and empirical equations have been developed for the size distribution estimation of the sediment leaving the field, including the physically-based models and empirical equations. usually, physically-based models require a large amount of data, sometimes exceeding the amount of available data in the modeled area. conversely, empirical equations do not always predict the sediment composition associated with individual events and may require data that are not always available. therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a model to predict the particle size distribution (psd) of eroded soil. a total of 41 erosion events from 21 soils were used. these data were compiled from previous studies. correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to identify the main variables controlling sediment psd. these variables were the particle size distribution in the soil matrix, the antecedent soil moisture condition, soil erodibility, and hillslope geometry. with these variables, an artificial neural network was calibrated using data from 29 events (r(2) = 0.98, 0.97, and 0.86; for sand, silt, and clay in the sediment, respectively) and then validated and tested on 12 events (r(2) = 0.74, 0.85, and 0.75; for sand, silt, and clay in the sediment, respectively). the artificial neural network was compared with three empirical models. the network presented better performance in predicting sediment psd and differentiating rain-runoff events in the same soil. in addition to the quality of the particle distribution estimates, this model requires a small number of easily obtained variables, providing a convenient routine for predicting psd in eroded sediment in other pollutant transport models.

geotextile	this study proposes synthesizing high strength polyester (hspet) fibers and polypropylene (pp) fibers to form hspet/pp-fasciated yarns, which are tested for tensile strength after they are exposed to uv radiations. the yarns are then made into geogrids, after which the geogrids are tested by administering the single or multi-rib tensile method, and are then evaluated for mass per unit area and installation damage. the test results show that the tensile strength and elongation of the fascinated yarns decrease as a result of their exposure to uv. the geogrids that are composed of fascinated yarns are unable to evenly distribute a force. the installation damage of hspet/pp geogrids is greater than that of traditional geogrids, as are the cases of other applications. as a result, hspet/pp geogrids can be reformed to improve their inferior performances.
suspension_bridge	the mechanism of aerostatic torsional divergence (atd) of long-span suspension bridges is investigated. a theoretical analysis on the basis of a generalized model is presented, showing that the vertical motion of a bridge deck is crucial to the torsional stiffness of the whole suspended system, and that the vertical motion of either cable with a magnitude beyond a certain threshold could result in a sudden degradation of the torsional stiffness of the system. this vertical motion-induced degradation of stiffness is recognized as the main reason for the atd. long-span suspension bridges are susceptible to such a type of divergence, especially when they are immersed in turbulent wind fields. the divergences that occur in turbulent wind fields differ significantly from those in smooth wind fields, and the difference is well explained by the generalized model that the loosening of any one cable could result in the vanishing of the part of stiffness provided by the whole cable system. the mechanism revealed in this paper leads to a definition of the critical wind speed of the atd in a turbulent flow; that is, the one resulting in a vertical motion so large as to loosen either cable to a stressless state. numerical results from the nonlinear finite-element (fe) analysis of the xihoumen suspension bridge, in conjunction with observations from wind tunnel tests on an aero-elastic full bridge model, are in support of the viewpoint presented in this study.

ambient_intelligence	the number of smart devices around us grows more and more every day, and with it the need to interface them in order to share data and activate functions. each day, new scenarios and new applications emerge to make our lives easier in many different contexts. the race towards realizing a true internet of things (iot) paradigm has already begun, and by now such reality is at hand. the work presented herein aims to offer a practicable, scalable solution for fulfilling many of the promises of the internet of things, even in contexts rendered problematic by the continuing presence of closed proprietary systems, lacking any compatibility with internet protocols, such as the home automation industry. starting with a major contribution by our laboratory to the field of interoperability among natively incompatible domotic technologies, a software module has been developed to enable any and all home automation devices to interface and interact via the ipv6 network protocol. each and every home automation device can thereby interact actively with the surrounding world, as it has been made reachable through its own ipv6 address that identifies it uniquely on the internet. the proposed system thereby advances users' ability to take full advantage of the benefits offered by the new iot vision of the world.
construction_management	culture plays an important role in arab middle east society. its unique historical, social, and religious traditions require special attention to cultural traits in the exercise of authority, control, and interaction. however, little research has investigated the effects of national culture on the management practices of construction companies. this research investigates this relationship through a questionnaire survey and interviews of a sample of construction companies in the united arab emirates (uae). it solicits views about the type of and experiences concerning the effect of the key national and cultural dimensions on adopted management practices. the research demonstrates that construction companies within the uae construction industry have developed and adopted a unique management style that is a mixture of western and eastern management applications. these companies have primarily adopted a clan culture that emphasizes the development of human resources, flexibility, decentralization, teamwork, consensus decision making, and information sharing.
water_pollution	potential human health risk from waterborne diseases arising from unsatisfactory performance of on-site wastewater treatment systems is driven by landscape factors such as topography, soil characteristics, depth to water table, drainage characteristics and the presence of surface water bodies. these factors are present as random variables which are spatially distributed across a region. a methodological framework is presented that can be applied to model and evaluate the influence of various factors on waterborne disease potential. this framework is informed by spatial data and expert knowledge. for prediction at unsampled sites, interpolation methods were used to derive a spatially smoothed surface of disease potential which takes into account the uncertainty due to spatial variation at any pre-determined level of significance. this surface was constructed by accounting for the influence of multiple variables which appear to contribute to disease potential. the framework developed in this work strengthens the understanding of the characteristics of disease potential and provides predictions of this potential across a region. the study outcomes presented constitutes an innovative approach to environmental monitoring and management in the face of data paucity.

water_pollution	ditch cleaning in drained peatland forests increases sediment loads and degrades water quality in headwater streams and lakes. a better understanding of the processes controlling ditch erosion and sediment transport in such systems is a prerequisite for proper peatland management. in order to relate hydrological observations to key erosion processes in headwater peatlands drained for forestry, a two-year study was conducted in a nested sub-catchment system (treated with ditch cleaning) and at two reference sites. the treated catchment was instrumented for continuous discharge and turbidity monitoring, erosion pin measurements of changes in ditch bed and banks and time-integrated sampling of suspended sediment (ss) composition. the results showed that ditch cleaning clearly increased transient suspended sediment concentrations (sscs) and suspended sediment yields (ssys), and resulted in temporary storage of loosely deposited organic sediment in the ditch network. after exhaustion of this sediment storage, subaerial processes and erosion from ditch banks became dominant in producing sediment for transport. recorded sscs were higher on the rising limbs of event hydrographs throughout the study period, indicating that ss transport was limited by availability of erosion-prone sediment. a strong positive correlation (r-2=0.84, p<0.001) between rainfall intensity (above a threshold of 1mmh(-1)) and average ssc obtained on the rising limb of hydrographs for the sub-catchment showed that soil detachment from ditch banks by raindrop impact can directly increase ssc in runoff. at the main catchment outlet, variation in ssc was best explained (r-2=0.67, p<0.05) by the linear combination of initial discharge (-), peak discharge (+) and the lag time from initial to peak discharge (-). based on these factors, ditch cleaning slightly increased peak discharges and decreased transit times in the study catchment. the implications of the results for water pollution management in peatland forests are discussed. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
construction_management	heavy lifting and exceptional transport equipment has been developed in an amazing way in the last two decades. some years ago, transporting and lifting elements with the weights and sizes that we are capable to transport and lift nowadays was inconceivable. big cranes were used to lift few hundreds of tons but now projects go up to thousand tons and at very important working radius, alternative heavy lift systems such as gantries, jacks, etc. are used for special jobs and, regarding transportation, self- propelled modular transporters (spmt) have been developing, increasing in number, and over 14.000 ton platforms have been moved on wheels. shipping is also adapting fast to this scenario with higher capacity geared vessels and other type of multimodal ships. this capacity increase is being used in civil and industrial construction (occasionally even in building construction) by developing prefabrication and modularization since it opens the possibility to handle bigger and heavier pieces. the advantages for construction are very important: better safety because work can be achieved without working on heights, better quality because of working in a more controlled environment (prefabrication yards, factories, etc.), improving the schedules by working on several parts simultaneously, price reductions by optimizing construction methods, global sequence and locations.

geotextile	in double-lined tunnels, geotextiles are installed between shotcrete and concrete linings to drain ground water that is in the circumferential boundary of the tunnels. during the concrete lining placement, the geotextile often experiences pressures from young concrete on the curved and rough shotcrete surfaces. the pressures are transferred through a waterproof membrane, and act in the normal direction to the curved shotcrete face. the geotextile flow behavior under these conditions cannot be represented by standard geotextile permeability tests. instead, it requires specially designed performance tests that consider field conditions. a new device to evaluate the permeability of the geotextile in pressurized curved flow channels is proposed; it adopts a flexible loading system and a curved and rough model plate. testing of geotextiles used for tunnel drainage systems, using the proposed arrangement, shows that the effects of the tortuousity of the flow in pressurized channels affects significantly the geotextile permeability.
remote_sensing	a remotely-piloted aircraft (rpa) is used in this study to collect high resolution data of the flow in complex terrain at a potential site for a wind energy test field in southern germany. it is described how such a system was used to retrieve information about the flow field, turbulence intensity, vertical wind components and shear at an escarpment site that is known for its high wind potential. measurements were done with the aircraft on several days with varying wind and weather conditions, while the focus of the study is on the characterisation of the flow field in main wind direction and neutral stratification. it is shown that flow inclination of up to 30 is found over the escarpment, but attenuates within a few hundred metres downstream. the formation of a reattached boundary layer could be measured, as well as an increased turbulence intensity in the reattachment zone. the results are highly valuable information for the planning of a wind energy test site at the location of the experiment and can also be used for the validation of numerical simulations and remote sensing instruments.

remote_sensing	the impact of human activities via land use/cover changes on ndvi trends is critical for an improved understanding of satellite-observed changes in vegetation productivity in drylands. the dominance of positive ndvi trends in the sahel, the so-called re-greening, is sometimes interpreted as a combined effect of an increase in rainfall and cropland expansion or agricultural intensification. yet, the impact of changes in land use has yet to be thoroughly tested and supported by empirical evidence. at present, no studies have considered the importance of the different seasonal ndvi signals of cropped and fallowed fields when interpreting ndvi trends, as both field types are commonly merged into a single 'cropland' class. we make use of the distinctly different phonology of cropped and fallowed fields and use seasonal ndvi curves to separate these two field types. a fuzzy classifier is applied to quantify cropped and fallowed areas in a case study region in the southern sahel (fakara, niger) on a yearly basis between 2000 and 2014. we find that fallowed fields have a consistently higher ndvi than unmanured cropped fields and by using two seasonal ndvi metrics (the amplitude and the decreasing rate) derived from the modis time series, a clear separation between classes of fields is achieved (r = 0.77). the fuzzy classifier can compute the percentage of a pixel (250 m) under active cultivation, thereby alleviating the problem of small field sizes in the region. we find a predominant decrease in ndvi over the period of analysis associated with an increased area of cropped fields at the expense of fallowed fields. our findings couple cropping abandonment (more frequent fallow years) with positive ndvi trends and an increase in the percentage of the cropped area (fallow period shortening) with negative trends. these findings profoundly impact our understanding of greening and browning trends in agrarian sahelian drylands and in other drylands of developing countries characterized by limited use of fertilizers.

solar_energy	a statistical analysis and inter-comparison of the solar radiation at two sites in cyprus representing two different climate regimes of the island (athalassa-inland plain vs larnaca-coastal location) covering the period january 2013-december 2015 is presented. mean annual and mean monthly daily totals of the global, horizontal beam and diffuse radiation and their frequency distribution at both sites are computed and discussed. the values of skewness and kurtosis coefficients are used to define the frequency distribution type of the above radiation parameters on a monthly basis. the statistical analysis is extended to the daily clearness index (k-t), diffuse ratio (k-d), and the ratio of horizontal beam to global radiation (k-b,k-g). furthermore, the influencing factors on the magnitude of the radiation components were examined. the value of k-t was used to classify three different types of days such as clear, partially cloudy and cloudy days. then, a statistical analysis of the solar radiation components was performed. on an average annual basis, more than 80% of the days are classified as either clear or partially cloudy at both stations. additionally, the influence of the atmospheric absorption and scattering of the solar radiation under clear skies was examined on the basis of the linke turbidity factor (t-l). the results of this analysis are used to characterize and compare the radiation regimes of the two sites. both sites have relatively high intensity of global and direct horizontal radiation. the annual average daily global radiation intensity is 18.5 mj m(-2) at athalassa and 19.9 mj m(-2) at larnaca. the horizontal beam radiation is 13.1 mj m(-2) for athalassa and 14.2 mj m(-2) for larnaca. therefore, the fraction of the beam component of the global radiation is comparatively high at both sites, as indicated by the annual average daily fraction which is greater than 0.600. generally, larnaca has slightly higher rates of global radiation than athalassa, as indicated by the average yearly cumulative global irradiation which is 6763 mj m(-2) for athalassa and 7274 mj m(-2) for larnaca.

construction_management	managing the engineering interfaces of mass rapid transit (mrt) projects is difficult and exhausting work because thousands of complex interrelated construction interfaces are embedded among multiple subworks and subsystems. when these interfaces are not revealed and thoroughly preplanned to achieve timely execution, they generate countless disputes among project parties and delay the overall progress considerably. this paper discusses a stepwise procedure to provide an empirical and comprehensive solution for managing the engineering interface of mrt projects. the proposed procedure involves four steps: (1) identification of the key interface correlation and work scope using a work-breakdown structure; (2) allocation of interface scope responsibilities and criteria using a phase approach; (3) preplanning the interface work items; and (4) setting up interface organizations using veto authorization. the proposed method is suitable for design-build or design-bid-build mrt contracts, thereby benefiting practitioners of interface management in the relevant field.

smart_material	thin porous materials that can spontaneously transport oil fluids just in a single direction have great potential for making energy-saving functional membranes. however, there is little data for the preparation and functionalities of this smart material. here, we report a novel method to prepare one-way oil-transport fabrics and their application in detecting liquid surface tension. this functional fabric was prepared by a two-step coating process to apply flowerlike zno nanorods, fluorinated decyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, and hydrolyzed fluorinated alkylsilane on a fabric substrate. upon one-sided uv irradiation, the coated fabric shows a one-way transport feature that allows oil fluid transport automatically from the unirradiated side to the uv-irradiated surface, but it stops fluid transport in the opposite direction. the fabric still maintains high superhydrophobicity after uv treatment. the one-way fluid transport takes place only for the oil fluids with a specific surface tension value, and the fluid selectivity is dependent on the uv treatment time. changing the uv irradiation time from 6 to 30 h broadened the one-way transport for fluids with surface tension from around 22.3 mn/m to a range of 22.3-56.7 mn/m. we further proved that this selective one-way oil transport can be used to estimate the surface tension of a liquid simply by observing its transport feature on a series of fabrics with different one-way oil-transport selectivities. to our knowledge, this is the first example to use one-way fluid-transport materials for testing the liquid surface tension. it may open up further theoretical studies and the development of novel fluid sensors.
water_pollution	this paper analyses whether china 's export vat rebates and export taxes are driven by environmental concerns. since china struggles to enforce environmental regulation, trade policy can be used as a second-best environmental policy. in a general equilibrium model it is possible to show that the second-best export tax increases in a product 's pollution intensity. the empirical analysis investigates whether the export tax equivalent of partial vat rebates and export taxes are higher for products which are more pollution intensive along several dimensions. the results indicate that the vat rebate rates are set in a way that discourages exports of water pollution intensive, 502 intensive and energy intensive products from 2007 on. moreover, the conservation of natural resources such as minerals, metals, wood products and precious stones seems to be a key determinant of china 's export vat rebate rates. there is little evidence that export taxes are motivated by environmental concerns.

geotextile	this paper reports on an evaluation of the properties of a novel structure known as oasis (r) which was designed at coventry university as an enhancement of the commercially available geotextiles when incorporated in the permeable pavement system (pps). the impact on the hydraulic behaviour of a pps was analysed through the study of infiltration rate, throughout the pps and time required to reach the steady-state stage behaviour of the water within the pps, under extreme rainfall intensities of 100mm/hr, 200mm/hr and 400mm/hr, corresponding to a 100-year return period rainfall over a duration of 15min in different parts of the world. the result indicated that the novel structure provides an extra benefit when incorporated in ppss, delaying peak flow of a rainfall event by retaining and storing great volumes of water within its structure. these additional benefits are especially important under extreme rainfall events.
ambient_intelligence	with an ever-increasing accessibility to different multimedia contents in real-time, it is difficult for users to identify the proper resources from such a vast number of choices. by utilizing the user 's context while consuming diverse multimedia contents, we can identify different personal preferences and settings. however, there is a need to reinforce the recommendation process in a systematic way, with context-adaptive information. the contributions of this paper are twofold. first, we propose a framework, called recam, which enables the collection of contextual information and the delivery of resulted recommendation by adapting the user 's environment using ambient intelligent (ami) interfaces. second, we propose a recommendation model that establishes a bridge between the multimedia resources, user joint preferences, and the detected contextual information. hence, we obtain a comprehensive view of the user 's context, as well as provide a personalized environment to deliver the feedback. we demonstrate the feasibility of recam with two prototypes applications that use contextual information for recommendations. the offline experiment conducted shows the improvement of delivering personalized recommendations based on the user 's context on two real-world datasets.
suspension_bridge	to investigate the nonlinear aerostatic stability of the hutong cable-stayed rail-cum-road bridge with ultra-kilometer main span, a fem bridge model is established. the tri-component wind loads and geometric nonlinearity are taken into consideration and discussed for the influence of nonlinear parameters and factors on bridge resistant capacity of aerostatic instability. the results show that the effect of initial wind attack-angle is significant for the aerostatic stability analysis of the bridge. the geometric nonlinearities of the bridge are of considerable importance in the analysis, especially the effect of cable sag. the instable mechanism of the hutong bridge with a steel truss girder is the spatial combination of vertical bending and torsion with large lateral bending displacement. the design wind velocity is much lower than the static instability wind velocity, and the structural aerostatic resistance capacity can meet the requirement.
water_pollution	advanced science and technology based on carbon-based nanomaterials is experiencing a rapid rate of change in the performance capabilities to substitute or serve as alternative approaches for the existing technologies. one of the major environmental concerns is the water pollution by the heavy metals. heavy metals in water are the main preoccupation for many years because of the toxicity towards aquatic-life, human beings and also the environment. in the context of water and wastewater treatment, significant numbers of breakthroughs have been achieved to drive accelerated change for ceaseless capability improvements. in this contribution, the unique features of promising carbon-based nanomaterials that have generated tremendous interest among the material researchers are described along with their potential applications in water and wastewater treatment. carbon-based nanomaterials stand out to be one of the highly efficient nanomaterials due to it is a vast availability and lower production cost compared to other nanomaterials. this paper critically reviewed the application of different type of carbon-based nanomaterials in water and wastewater treatment. the carbon nanomaterials role in adsorption, disinfection and membrane separation mechanisms that enable the applications are discussed. advantages and limitations as well as barriers and research needs are highlighted. challenges include technical hurdles, high cost, and environmental and health risk.

rainwater_harvesting	in recent years, the pollution of receiving water induced by urban stormwater runoff has gained considerable attention. meanwhile, rainwater is also a potential and valuable water resource, which may effectively mitigate the increasing water shortage. in the present study, the distributions and transport of nutrients and heavy metals in different stormwater runoff of two residential communities (site a and b) under the effect of drainage systems were discussed in detail. site a with combined drainage system was located in old district featured with a lot of big manufacturing and chemical factories in suburb. differently, site b with separate system was situated in new district occupied by small shops and residential quarters. the results indicated that air quality was a significant influence factor and reference index in the decision-making of rainwater harvesting and reuse. for nutrients, the anthropic activities contributed adequately ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus to the road runoff (rd) and sewer overflows, especially in site a with combined drainage system. however, the roof runoff (rf) presented the highest event mean concentrations (emc) of nitrate and nitrite nitrogen, probably due to the high runoff coefficient of roof and low interference from human activities on dry deposition. zn(ii), cu(ii), and pb(ii) concentrations showed a similar variation pattern, although there were some small differences owing to the erosion of metal materials from rooftops and street lamps. compared with the standards for drinking water quality in china, the direct rainfall and rf in site b could be harvested and utilized for potential drinking water supply from the perspective of the studied parameters. for site a, at least 33.8% of nh4+-n and 50.8% of no3--n in rf must be removed before reuse. the results obtained in this research would provide an important assistance and support in urban rainwater reuse as well as runoff pollution control.
green_building	these days, the design and construction industry is challenged with the question ""how are architects, engineers, contractors, building owners using information technology to further automate their practices, building operation and benchmarking?"" the following case study with interviews will critically evaluate the 'integrated project delivery' process of the 'q1 thyssenkrupp quarter' in essen, germany built from 2009 to 2010, and decommissioned in 2012. the q1-energy concept of the thyssenkrupp headquarters' primary energy consumption is measured at 139.6 kwh/m(2)/yr and its ecological footprint has by 27% less co2 emissions than similar buildings in this category. one of the major innovative systems are the solar facade controlled system and the q1-total green building automation (desigo). siemens specifically developed a building automation system (bas) called green building monitor (tm) to supervise the building consumption data of q1 continuously for expert analysis. desigo includes a specially developed energy-efficient operating control concept for 1,133 rooms.
rainwater_harvesting	alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) is traditionally sown in field without ridge and furrow, in rain-fed semi-arid areas of northwest china, and forage yields are normally low because of drought, water loss and soil erosion. a field study was conducted to determine (i) monthly runoff efficiency and threshold rainfall for different ridge widths (30,45 and 60 cm), and mulched with different materials (common plastic film, bio-degradable mulching film and manually compacted soil); and (2) the effects of different ridge-furrow ratios (30:60,45:60 and 60:60) and ridge-mulching materials on soil water storage, topsoil temperature, forage yields, and water use efficiency (wue) of alfalfa in ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting (rfrwh) system, during 2 consecutive years: 2012 and 2013. average monthly runoff efficiency over these 2 years, was 16%, 18%, 19%, 65%, 71%, 77%, 70%, 72% and 79% for sr30, sr45, sr60, bmr30, bmr45, bmr50, cmr30, cmr45 and cmr60 (sr, bmr and cmr were ridges with manually compacted soil, mulched with bio-degradable mulch film and common plastic film, respectively, and subscripts 30,45 and 60 refer to ridge widths (cm) all with 60 6-11 furrow width), respectively. for the same treatments, threshold rainfall was 4.3, 4.3, 4.2, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.9, 2.9 and 2.8 mm. the field experiment showed that ridge mulching materials and ridge widths had distinct effects on topsoil temperature at ridge tops, but not at furrow bottoms. soil water storage in 140 cm soil depth at furrow bottoms increased with increasing ridge width and in the order of cmr approximate to bmr>sr>fp. average annual total forage yields for fp, sr, bmr and cmr were 6276, 5642, 7563 and 7817 kg ha(-1), respectively, over 2 years. the total precipitation in both years was higher than average of rainfall, leading to significant decreases of forage yields for sr, and significant increases of forage yields for bmr and cmr. compared with fp, average forage yields decreased by 3%, 10% and 17% for sr30, sr45 and sr60, and increased by 27%, 21%, 13%, 32%, 26% and 16% for bmr30, bmr45, bmr50, cmr30, cmr45 and cmr60, respectively, over 2 years. wue for sr, bmr and cmr was 1.69, 1.74 and 1.74 times greater than that for fp over 2 years, and increased with decreasing ridge width. optimum furrow width was 35-36 cm for cmr and bmr in the rfrwh system with 60 cm width furrows for alfalfa production in this region. future study is needed to investigate optimum ridge-furrow ratio and suitable ridge-mulching material for achieving the best environmental and economic benefit under different climatic conditions, soil types and plant species, and using bio-degradable mulching materials.

construction_management	safety climate has long been considered a leading indicator for the management of construction safety. although previous research has concluded that the safety climate of an organization is significantly affected by communication among its individuals, only a limited number of construction studies have explored this relationship as mediated by organizational fit. to redress this deficiency, this study investigated the association between communication and safety climate mediated by person-organization (p-o) fit. first, a baseline of communication responsibilities was established by analyzing project-related documentation from four subcontractors in china. through a review of this documentation, 80 responses were collected, which were subjected to social network analysis (sna) to develop metrics that gauge communication performance. by analyzing person-organization fit in terms of communication [as determined by degree centrality (pof-d) and betweenness centrality (pof-b)], the association between communicative performance and safety climate was established. the analyses revealed that high pof-d can yield an organizational environment that restricts team communication, thus limiting the opportunities to improve the organization 's safety climate. in contrast, high pof-b can generate a more relaxing atmosphere in which managers promote open communication, thus facilitating the improvement of the organization 's safety climate. given these findings, this study provides a new perspective for investigating the relationship between communication and safety climate in the construction industry. as such, it provides the basis for future research in this area.
remote_sensing	water use control methods and water resources planning are of high priority. in irrigated agriculture, the right way to save water is to increase water use efficiency through better management. the present work validates procedures and methodologies using remote sensing to determine the water availability in the soil at each moment, giving the opportunity for the application of the water depth strictly necessary to optimise crop growth (optimum irrigation timing and irrigation amount). the analysis is applied to the irrigation district of divor, evora, using 7 experimental plots, which are areas irrigated by centre pivot systems, cultivated to maize. data were determined from images of the cultivated surface obtained by satellite and integrated with atmosphere and crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress in the vegetation normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), kc, and kcb. therefore, evapotranspiration (etc) was estimated and used to calculate crop water requirement, together with the opportunity and the amount of irrigation water to allocate. although remote sensing data available from satellite imagery presented some practical constraints, the study could contribute to the validation of a new methodology that can be used for irrigation management of a large irrigated area, easier and at lower costs than the traditional fao recommended crop coefficients method. the remote sensing based methodology can also contribute to significant saves of irrigation water.

rainwater_harvesting	great investment is made in the design and installation of stormwater control measures (scms). substantial research investment, too, is made to optimise the performance of scms. however, once installed, scms often suffer from lack of maintenance or even outright neglect. key maintenance needs for wet ponds, constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention, infiltration practices, permeable pavement, swales, and rainwater harvesting systems are reviewed with many tasks, such as the cleaning of pre-treatment areas and the preservation of infiltration surfaces, being common maintenance themes among scms. consequences of lacking maintenance are illustrated (mainly insufficient function or failure). probable reasons for neglect include insufficient communication, unclear responsibilities, lack of knowledge, financial barriers, and decentralised measures. in future designs and research, maintenance (and lack thereof) should be considered. assessing the performance of scms conservatively and including safety factors may prevent consequences of under-maintenance; and requiring regular inspection may help to enforce sufficient maintenance.
smart_material	in the present work, a biosensor was built with smart material based on polymer brushes. the biosensor demonstrated a ph-sensitive on-off property, and it was further used to control or modulate the electrochemical responses of the biosensor. this property could be used to realize ph-controlled electrochemical reaction of hydrogen peroxide and hrp immobilized on polymer brushes. the composite film also showed excellent amperometric i-t response toward hydrogen peroxide in the concentration range of 0-13 mu m. in future, this platform might be used for self-regulating targeted diagnostic, drug delivery and biofuel cell based on controllable bioelectrocatalysis.

smart_material	a novel replacement for traditional wedgelocks used to mount pcb boards to cold plates is presented. this project began as part of a darpa design competition to develop a field reversible thermal connector that could be repeatedly assembled and disassembled without the use of tools while providing constant thermal resistance. the team from ucla was tasked with designing a new device to meet these constraints. the design meets the darpa goals and significantly reduces the thermal resistance between the electrical board and the heat sink. the device consists of opposing aluminum wedges, driven by thermally actuated nitinol springs, which slide against one another to provide the requisite locking force to hold a board in place and decrease contact resistance between the interfaces. these smart material springs push the wedges towards the outside of the device, elevating the upper surface and locking the board in place on the cold plate. the design increases the contact area between the components and decreases the thermal resistance relative to current devices. experimental results have shown that the ucla team has addressed the chief design problems posed by the revcon program. nitinol has been shown to be an effective material for use as a thermally actuated spring capable of repeatedly engaging and disengaging without the use of tools. the wedge locking force increases with rising temperature, enhancing its thermal performance. the ucla design has been shown to out-perform similar sized current state of the art wedgelock designs in terms of thermal resistance. reductions in thermal resistance of 30%-45% have been demonstrated and shown to be repeatable. our prototype design increases the interfacial contact area which has a dramatic impact on performance. this means that higher power density electronics can be utilized or that more real estate will be made available on current computer boards in order to maintain current performance. further, the use of thermally actuated leaf springs removes the need for mechanical force for installation allowing for less installation time.
green_building	this study establishes a scientific, reasonable, and feasible comprehensive evaluation system for green building 's power supply system design and implementation to achieve optimization of their thermal, environmental, and economic performance. unlike traditional evaluation methods that use single index such as economic performance or exergy efficiency for the criterion, the proposed evaluation method takes annual revenue, exergy efficiency, co2 emission, and system reliability as indices. this advanced comprehensive evaluation method is based on a combination of the method of the gray relational analysis (gra) and the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to assess the multiobjective performance of building 's power supply systems. the method is applied to compare four kinds of the power supply system of a hospital to determine the optimal system. the result shows that the system which combines cooling, heating, and power supply systems (cchp) adding solar photovoltaic (pv) panels has the best comprehensive performance when the capacitance of solar pv panels is large enough.
remote_sensing	change detection is one of the most important applications of remote sensing technology. it is a challenging task due to the obvious variations in the radiometric value of spectral signature and the limited capability of utilizing spectral information. in this paper, an improved sparse coding method for change detection is proposed. the intuition of the proposed method is that unchanged pixels in different images can be well reconstructed by the joint dictionary, which corresponds to knowledge of unchanged pixels, while changed pixels cannot. first, a query image pair is projected onto the joint dictionary to constitute the knowledge of unchanged pixels. then reconstruction error is obtained to discriminate between the changed and unchanged pixels in the different images. to select the proper thresholds for determining changed regions, an automatic threshold selection strategy is presented by minimizing the reconstruction errors of the changed pixels. adequate experiments on multispectral data have been tested, and the experimental results compared with the state- of- the- art methods prove the superiority of the proposed method. contributions of the proposed method can be summarized as follows: 1) joint dictionary learning is proposed to explore the intrinsic information of different images for change detection. in this case, change detection can be transformed as a sparse representation problem. to the authors' knowledge, few publications utilize joint learning dictionary in change detection; 2) an automatic threshold selection strategy is presented, which minimizes the reconstruction errors of the changed pixels without the prior assumption of the spectral signature. as a result, the threshold value provided by the proposed method can adapt to different data due to the characteristic of joint dictionary learning; and 3) the proposed method makes no prior assumption of the modeling and the handling of the spectral signature, which can be adapted to different data.
construction_management	the multimode resource-constrained (mrc) problem aims at finding the start times and execution modes for the activities of a project that minimizes project duration under current precedence constraints and resource limitations. this study integrates the fuzzy c-means clustering technique and the chaotic technique into the differential evolution to develop the fuzzy clustering chaotic-based differential evolution (fcde) algorithm, an efficient hybrid approach to solving mrc and other related problems. within the fcde, the chaos prevents the optimization algorithm from premature convergence and the fuzzy c-means clustering acts as several multi-parent crossover operators for utilizing population information efficiently and enhance convergence efficiency. further, this study applies a serial method to reflect individual-user priorities into the active schedule and the project duration calculations. experiments run indicate that the proposed fcde-mrc obtains optimal results more reliably and efficiently than the benchmark algorithms considered. the fcde-mrc is a promising alternative methodology to handling resource-constrained problems.
green_building	sustainable construction as a construction method is a beginning to gain traction among indonesian contractors, but with the dearth of research, knowledge, socialization and strategic support in this field, there are many obstacles towards en masse adoption in indonesia: to be applied ""effectively"" and to become part of a ""strategic method"". the concept of sustainable construction primarily emphasizes the wise use of resources (primarily natural resources), thereby systematically guaranteeing the fulfillment of future needs. however, the use of recycled materials is still hampered by the difficulty of field implementation; this is attested by the low scores attained in green building certification. this study will analyze the strategies needed to support sustainable construction in relation to supply chain management for materials, which have not been implemented well in indonesia, whereas it has the highest impact in contributing to the effectiveness of sustainable construction. the aim of study is to analyze supply chain performance in materials of construction projects. the measurement used is the supply chain operations reference (scor) model with perfect order fulfillment and overall value at risk as a key performance indicator (kpi). the result of the study is the percentage of material that could be used by the management of supply chain. once the kpi is more fulfilled by perfect order fulfillment, the use of material is more complete to support sustainable construction.

solar_energy	three-dimensional (3d)-zno and fes2 materials were synthesized on top of a graphene layer using a facile and cost effective hydrothermal growth method. graphene/3d-zno was demonstrated as an efficient alternative to the standard fluorine-doped tin oxide (fto)/zno based photoanode in dye sensitized solar cells (dsscs) due to larger surface area, better charge transport characteristic and higher electrochemical activity. in addition, graphene/fes2 nanostructures were also revealed as an efficient replacement for the conventional pt counter electrode (ce). by exploiting the synergy of these components dsscs with power conversion efficiency (pce) of 7.04% were demonstrated under 100 mw cm(-2) simulated solar radiation.

smart_material	with very simple methods, we fabricate photoelectrical devices using a regular paper as substrate; these sensors are able to detect ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation using different paper additives. the experiment we made to test detection of ultraviolet and visible light consists in irradiating light of different wavelengths over a device made of paper and semiconductor crystals; electrical current of these devices increases importantly when the bandgap energy of the semiconductor crystal is reached. to test the sensitivity to infrared, we use paper devices impregnated with salts and glycerol to increment its electrical conductivity due to the augmentation of ionic current carriers. we observe that the ionic conductivity on paper increases when the paper is irradiated by infrared light from hot objects; this phenomenon might be due to the molecular structure of cellulose that absorbs energy in the infrared part of the spectrum.
rainwater_harvesting	water is a precious resource. its demand is rising rapidly and has already exceeded the supply capacity of natural sources in many cities. airports are spread over vast areas which are normally free from birds and pollution and thus offer immense opportunities for rainwater harvesting which could, to a large extent, meet their non-potable water requirements. this article reviews rainwater treatment procedures at various airports which not only provide a valuable resource for their own consumption but also prevent the entry of pollutants directly into the environment. it also discusses the models and approaches to assess the rainwater harvesting potential of airports on parameters of cost and reliability. it explains the stages involved in the rainwater harvesting systems and how some airports have implemented rainwater treatment systems. finally, it identifies the gaps at various stages and discusses possible improvements in the near future.
remote_sensing	this study applies multispectral band ratios to examine vegetation density and vegetation health to assess drought conditions over nearly 30 years (1989-2016) in tuy phong district, binh thuan province, vietnam using a sequence of landsat imagery (tm and oli). our research area has a distinctive climate, characterized by arid and semiarid areas adjacent to binh thuan 's coastline. drought is likely intensified by rain shadow effects of the central highlands (part of the truong son- or the annamese cordillera, positioned immediately west of the province). the seasonal land surface temperature (lst) and normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) were calculated to derive three other indices: vegetation condition index (vci), temperature condition index (tci), and vegetation health index (vhi). results show that approximately two-thirds of tuy phong district was influenced by mid-to-severe drought. during the dry season (november to the following april), severity of drought has increased both intensively and extensively toward the north. hypotheses testing of correlation between lst and ndvi also revealed a significantly negative relationship - increasing surface temperature and decreasing ndvi. to validate our results, we applied the same procedure for generating the vhi from modis data. despite the absence of historical datasets for our region, landsat data shows many advantages in monitoring drought in remote and small areas compared to modis. our research strategies may be effective in other regions without sufficient climatic records for conventional climatic analysis.

solar_energy	this experimental study shows the results of an analysis of the performance of a stand-alone renewable energy system for greenhouse heating on a winter day. the systems consist of photovoltaic panels connected to an electrolyzer which during daylight hours produce hydrogen by electrolysis and then store it in a pressure tank. during the night, thanks to a fuel cell, the hydrogen is converted into electricity in order to feed a ground source geothermal heat pump to heat a tunnel greenhouse. the procedure for estimating hourly solar radiation, hydrogen production and consumption for short-term energy storage on a partly cloudy day is also given. the solar energy usability concept, the capacity of energy storage systems and the thermal energy load govern the effective energy management of the system. this performance analysis is necessary to determine the actual total efficiency of integrated photovoltaic, geothermal and hydrogen renewable energy systems and their contribution to the load. the overall system efficiency obtained, starting from the amount of solar energy available during daylight hours until it is used as thermal energy at night, was 11%.

rainwater_harvesting	in rural areas of northwest china, rainwater harvesting appears to be the most promising alternative for supplying drinking water in the face of increasing water scarcity and escalating demand. the quality of collected cistern rainwater in rural northwest china was assessed. the results show that most of the collected cistern rainwater quality parameters in rural northwest china conformed to drinking water quality standard in china, except turbidity, codmn, and total coliforms. a uv disinfection system was proposed to polish the collected cistern rainwater. after uv treatment, the removal efficiencies of turbidity, codmn and total coliforms were 73.7-82.2%, 60.0-76.4% and 93.9-100%, respectively. the treatment of collected cistern rainwater could provide water adequate to safe drinking water guidelines.
geotextile	this paper presents the results of centrifuge tests performed to investigate the behavior of geotextile-reinforced soil walls beyond stress conditions. the models were built using nonwoven fabrics as reinforcement layers and dry sand as backfill. digital image analysis techniques were used to determine the displacement of sand markers placed along the reinforcements. the models were loaded until failure by increasing centrifugal acceleration, and the movements of the sand markers were used to determine the strain distributions along the reinforcement layers. the results revealed that stresses redistribute among reinforcement layers as models approach failure. current design methods for grs walls were found to be conservative when applied to predict the behavior of the reduced-scale models.
rainwater_harvesting	a root-zone water balance model was used to simulate the soil moisture storage of maize (zea mays l.) and rice (oryza sativa l.) fields in rainfed uplands of eastern india. the simulation study revealed that short duration (95 days) rice fields in uplands remained under ponding condition for a period of 32 days during the entire growing season. based on the ponding depth requirement in rice fields (50 mm), excess ponding was found for seven days only out of the 32 days of ponding. in contrast, the maize field under similar length of growing season (95 days) and topographic condition could produce harvestable runoff for 23 days. furthermore, the rice crop was to remain under moisture stress for eight days during its mid-season stage, whereas the maize was found to be without stress during entire growing season. before sowing of winter crops, the soil moisture in the seeding zone was determined to be depleted below germination soil moisture for 18 and 19 years out of 30 years of simulation in rice and maize fields, respectively. this implies that a second crop, following withdrawal of monsoon, is not possible without pre-sowing irrigation in three out of five years in rainfed uplands. thus, complete substitution of rice by maize in uplands would create a better scope for rainwater harvesting. alternatively, partial replacement of rice could be a viable option for meeting both rice demand of the people and harvesting of adequate rainwater for supplemental irrigation to crops in rainy and winter seasons.

water_pollution	due to their harmful effects on human 's life and aquatic environments, designing easy and swift yet efficient methodologies to remove pollutants from water stream is one of the important tasks of the scientific community. among the pollutants, dyes have a significant role on water pollution, because their presence, even in low concentration, impacts the aquatic life by preventing the photosynthesis process and it can be considered as toxic chemicals endangering the human 's health. in this study three newly synthesized task specific ionic liquids (tsils) incorporating different types of aromatic group on imidazolium ring namely, 1-butyl-3-benzoimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [bzbim][ntf2]; 1-butyl-2-phenyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [bphirn][ntf2]; and 1-benzyl-3-butyl. imidazolum bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [bnblm][ntf2] have been employed to remove swiftly heavy loads (up to 1,500 ppm) of cationic methylene blue dye (mb) from aqueous solution without ph adjustment the results showed that the presence of additional aromatic groups has a significant effect on the extraction efficiency of mb removal through enhancement of the pi-pi interactions between ils and the aromatic structure of mb. conductor-like screening model for real solvent (cosmo-rs) was used to analyse the il-mb interaction in the studied systems. finally, an original microbiological method has been designed not only to assess the toxicity of aqueous solution before and after the extraction process to reveal the industrial potential of this methodology but also to highlight the high hydrophobicity of these new tsils.

suspension_bridge	we develop a new analytical model of the alfven wing that is generated by the interaction between a planetary moon 's ionosphere and its magnetospheric environment. while preceding analytical approaches assumed the obstacle 's height-integrated ionospheric conductivities to be spatially constant, the model presented here can take into account a continuous conductance profile that follows a power law. the electric potential in the interaction region, determining the electromagnetic fields of the alfven wing, can then be calculated from an euler-type differential equation. in this way, the model allows to include a realistic representation of the suspension bridge-like conductance profile expected for the moon 's ionosphere. the major drawback of this approach is its restriction to interaction scenarios where the ionospheric pedersen conductance is large compared to the hall conductance, and thus, the alfvenic perturbations are approximately symmetric between the planet-facing and the planet-averted hemispheres of the moon. the model is applied to the hemisphere coupling effect observed at enceladus, i.e., to the surface currents and the associated magnetic discontinuities that arise from a north-south asymmetry of the obstacle to the plasma flow. we show that the occurrence of this effect is very robust against changes in the conductance profile of enceladus' plume, and we derive upper limits for the strength of the magnetic field jumps generated by the hemisphere coupling effect. during all 11 reported detections of the hemisphere coupling currents at enceladus, the observed magnetic field jumps were clearly weaker than the proposed limits. our findings are also relevant for future in situ studies of putative plumes at the jovian moon europa.
green_building	the awareness for energy efficiency in buildings increasingly expands in algeria, where a legal framework exists for promoting the utilization of regenerative energies. however, models of best practice are still relatively few. as a contribution, this paper reports on a study, which aims at finding out the best design strategies for affordable energy efficient residential buildings. the focus is put on the mediterranean algiers and the saharan ghardaia. dynamic energy modelling was carried out using trnsys 17 to assess a residential house built as a med-enec pilot project. the simulation is executed at two sequential stages: the reconnaissance stage where the building is compared to a typically non-insulated conventional construction and then the assessment stage, in which the pilot project already designed to low energy standards is investigated in an attempt to increase its energy efficiency further. by means of a parametric study, the most efficient passive design measures for minimizing heating and cooling energy demands were delineated and their dimensioning fixed. the results confirm i) the easiness to save energy in comparison to the local inappropriate conventional building type, and ii) possible additional energy savings in the pilot project, so that almost no heating is required and the cooling visibly further reduced.

rainwater_harvesting	holistic farming systems provide designs for the whole farm that make long term sustainable use of nutrients, water, labour, finances and energy. in using organic residues to produce energy, and safely recycling the digested residues back into the farming system, a biogas digester could be a central component of many holistic systems. this paper discusses the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural constraints on the use of biogas digesters in holistic farming systems in sub-saharan africa. in higher altitude areas where maintenance of optimal temperature can constrain anaerobic digestion, floating drum or fixed dome digesters are a better option than flexible balloon digesters because they are less susceptible to temperature changes. if water is a key constraint, rainwater harvesting could be used to reduce the additional labour needed to collect water. if energy is the most limiting resource in the farming system, the optimum use of organic residues might be as a fuel for anaerobic digestion, whereas, if water is limiting, energy production by burning or pyrolysis might be a better option. the bioslurry from anaerobic digestion can be used in fish ponds to produce plankton to feed fish, and can be applied to fertile fields and fields of intermediate fertility, while biochar from pyrolysis is better used to improve the soil in infertile fields. if labour is limiting, it is particularly important that the system design minimises any additional labour needed to process the organic residues on a daily basis, considering trade-offs between labour and other resources.

water_pollution	residence times and connectivity are computed for 12 subregions in an urban man-made lake in china using a high-resolution tracer-transport model. the renewal timescales are explicitly defined and computed for two groups of four freshwater inflow scenarios related to water diversion projects. first, the timescale values are computed and compared using different computational criteria for the upper limit of integration in the residence time equation. the sensitivity analysis suggests that a calculation time of 300 days is necessary to satisfy the relative error (0.001) and 5 % cutoff value criteria. secondly, the residence times can range from 1.5 to 102 and 1.0 to 66 days under low and high flow conditions, respectively. water in the inner lake would reside in the lake for less than 66 days prior to exiting the region of interest. the timescale values can be applied to impact studies that investigate the extent of sudden water pollution events that initially affect a subdomain of a lake. finally, the lacustrine residence times are decomposed into the different subregion residence times, resulting in a connectivity matrix. this matrix can illustrate preferential connections among the individual subregions and reveal hidden patterns relating to local hydrodynamics in the lake.
remote_sensing	in a world facing rapid environmental changes, anticipating their impacts on biodiversity is of utmost relevance. remotely-sensed ecosystem functional attributes (efas) are promising predictors for species distribution models (sdms) by offering an early and integrative response of vegetation performance to environmental drivers. species of high conservation concern would benefit the most from a better ability to anticipate changes in habitat suitability. here we illustrate how yearly projections from sdms based on efas could reveal short-term changes in potential habitat suitability, anticipating mid-term shifts predicted by climate-change-scenario models. we fitted two sets of sdm5 for 41 plant species of conservation concern in the iberian peninsula: one calibrated with climate variables for baseline conditions and projected under two climate-change-scenarios (future conditions); and the other calibrated with efas for 2001 and projected annually from 2001 to 2013. range shifts predicted by climate-based models for future conditions were compared to the 2001-2013 trends from efas-based models. projections of efas-based models estimated changes (mostly contractions) in habitat suitability that anticipated, for the majority (up to 64%) of species, the mid-term shifts projected by traditional climate-change scenario forecasting, and showed greater agreement with the business-as-usual scenario than with the sustainable-development one. this study shows how satellite-derived efas can be used as meaningful essential biodiversity variables in sdm5 to provide early-warnings of range shifts and predictions of short-term fluctuations in suitable conditions for multiple species.

water_pollution	as a primary disposal mean of municipal solid waste in china, the landfill has been recognized as one of the major threats to the surrounding surface water and groundwater environment due to the emission of leachate. the aim of this study was to determine the impact of leachate on the surface water and groundwater environment of the region of the chang'an landfill, which is located in sichuan province, china. the surface water and groundwater were sampled for hydrochemical analysis. three electrical resistivity tomography profiles were conducted to evaluate the impact of leachate on the groundwater environment, and several laboratory tests were carried out to build the relationship between the soil bulk resistivity and the void fluid resistivity. the results showed that a seasonal creek named longfeng creek, which crosses the landfill site, was contaminated by the leachate. the concentrations of cod, bod5, and chlorides (cl) of surface water samples increased by 12.3-105.7 times. the groundwater quality in the surface loose sediments along the valley deteriorated obviously from the landfill to 500 m downstream area. the laboratory tests of soil samples indicated that the resistivity value of 13 omega m is a critical value whether the groundwater in the loose sediments is polluted. the groundwater at the site adjacent to the spillway in the landfill was partially contaminated by the emission of leachate. the groundwater contamination zones at 580 m downstream of the landfill were recognized at the shallow zones from 60 m left bank to 30 m right bank of longfeng creek. the improved understanding of groundwater contamination around the landfill is beneficial for the landfill operation and groundwater environment remediation.
stealth_technology	the potential of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (plga) microparticles as carriers for vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has been demonstrated in a previous study by our group, where we found improved angiogenesis and heart remodeling in a rat myocardial infarction model (formiga et al., 2010). however, the observed accumulation of macrophages around the injection site suggested that the efficacy of treatment could be reduced due to particle phagocytosis. the aim of the present study was to decrease particle phagocytosis and consequently improve protein delivery using stealth technology. pegylated microparticles were prepared by the double emulsion solvent evaporation method using troms (total recirculation one machine system). before the uptake studies in monocyte-macrophage cells lines (j774 and raw 264.7), the characterization of the microparticles developed was carried out in terms of particle size, encapsulation efficiency, protein stability, residual poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva) and in vitro release. microparticles of suitable size for intramyocardial injection (5 mu m) were obtained by troms by varying the composition of the formulation and troms conditions with high encapsulation efficiency (70-90%) and minimal residual pva content (0.5%). importantly, the bioactivity of the protein was fully preserved. moreover, pegylated microparticles released in phosphate buffer 50% of the entrapped protein within 4 h, reaching a plateau within the first day of the in vitro study. finally, the use of plga microparticles coated with peg resulted in significantly decreased uptake of the carriers by macrophages, compared with non pegylated microparticles, as shown by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. on the basis of these results, we concluded that pegylated microparticles loaded with vegf could be used for delivering growth factors in the myocardium.

construction_management	this paper presents a process management framework for multisensory data fusion for the purpose of tracking the progress of construction activity. the developed framework facilitates the required type of data fusion at any given point in the construction progress, reliably and efficiently. data are acquired from high-frequency automated technologies such as three-dimensional (3d) imaging and ultrawideband (uwb) positioning, in addition to foreman reports, schedule information, and other information sources. the results of validation through a detailed field implementation project show that the developed framework for fusing volumetric, positioning, and project control data can successfully address the challenges associated with fusing multisensory data by tracking activities rather than objects, a feature that offers superior capability, efficiency, and accuracy over the length of the project. other contributions of this research include the development of fusion processes that are performed at higher levels of data fusion instead of traditional low-level fusion algorithms, thus supporting decision-making processes and a number of automated construction management applications, such as construction progress tracking, earned-value estimation, and schedule updating.

green_building	particleboards are generally made in three layers using softwood as the major raw material. limitation on natural wood resources and concerns about the carbon footprint of products has created a significant interest in environmentally friendly or green' building materials. hardwood sawmill residue, which has been disposed as solid waste, was investigated by authors as the main raw material for producing particleboard at rmit university, australia. physical and mechanical properties of final particleboard were measured and analysed against original materials and process variables. the density of a particleboard along its thickness direction is not uniform, and is called the vertical density profile (vdp) which is dependent upon processing parameters. the vdp influences particleboard properties including flexural strength and its dimensional stability and fastening capacity. it is important to influence the formation of the vdp, altering processing variables, to achieve optimum particleboard properties. this paper presents an attempt to develop a model to predict the formation of the vdp of hardwood residue particleboard compared to processing parameters, using the theory of experimental design. the advantages of such a model in optimising particleboard properties are also discussed.
remote_sensing	a forest fire started on august 8th, 2016 in several places on madeira island causing damage and casualties. as of august 10th the local media had reported the death of three people, over 200 people injured, over 950 habitants evacuated, and 50 houses damaged. this study presents the preliminary results of the assessment of several spectral indices to evaluate the burn severity of madeira fires during august 2016. these spectral indices were calculated using the new european satellite sentinel-2a launched in june 2015. the study confirmed the advantages of several spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), green normalized difference vegetation index (gndvi), normalized burn ratio (nbr) and normalized difference vegetation index (ndvirexn) using red-edge spectral bands to assess the post-fire conditions. results showed high correlation between ndvi, gndvi, nbr and ndvireln spectral indices and the analysis performed by copernicus emergency management service (emsr175), considered as the reference truth. regarding the red-edge spectral indices, the ndvireln (using band b5, 705 nm) presented better results compared with b6 (740 nm) and b7 (783 nm) bands. these preliminary results allow us to assume that sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for post-fire monitoring. in the future, the two twin sentinel-2 satellites will offer global coverage of the madeira archipelago every five days, therefore allowing the simultaneous study of the evolution of the burnt area and reforestation information with high spatial (up to 10 m) and temporal resolution (5 days).

stealth_technology	we report a design of a temperature controlled tunable dual band terahertz absorber. the compact single unit cell consists of two nested closed square ring resonators and a layer metallic separated by a substrate strontium titanate (sto) dielectric layer. it is found that the absorber has two distinctive absorption peaks at frequencies 0.096 thz and 0.137 thz, whose peaks are attained 97% and 75%. cooling the absorber from 400 k to 250 k causes about 25% and 27% shift compared to the resonance frequency of room temperature, when we cooling the temperature to 150 k, we could attained both the two tunabilities exceeding 53%. the frequency tunability is owing to the variation of the dielectric constant of the low-temperature co-fired ceramic (ltcc) substrate. the mechanism of the dual band absorber is attributed to the overlapping of dual resonance frequencies, and could be demonstrated by the distributions of the electric field. the method opens up avenues for designing tunable terahertz devices in detection, imaging, and stealth technology.

rainwater_harvesting	evaluation of six maize varieties under four different water harvesting and tillage technologies was undertaken with the aim of determining their effect on the performance of maize genotypes and their effectiveness in improving nutrient and water use efficiency. the work was carried out at mariakani site (one of the kari centres) representing the arid and semi-arid lands of coastal kenya in the long rains and short rains seasons of 2005 and 2006 respectively. the results indicate that rainwater harvesting is not critical when the season is wetter than normal in the arid and semi-arid environments. this was demonstrated by the high yields that were recorded from the maize varieties (pwani hybrid 4-ph4, coast composite maize-ccm and the local check-mdzihana) which usually require relatively high rainfall amounts in order for them to produce better yields. despite the excellent performance of ph4, ccm and mdzihana, these maize varieties cannot be recommended for the semi-arid areas since the high yields were realized under above normal rainfall. there is need for further research to identify the maize varieties that would be appropriate for the areas that normally receive low rainfall.
rainwater_harvesting	this study aimed to investigate the effects of typhoons and dust storms on harvested rainwater quality. rainwater samples were collected from the rainwater harvesting systems in northern taiwan between september 2010 and april 2013. there were five typhoons and one dust storm that hit taiwan during this period. harvested rainwater was analyzed, including ph, electrical conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, total organic carbon (toc), acute biotoxicity test, and concentration of 13 metals and three anions. results of harvested rainwater of the dust storm showed it had higher ph, turbidity, toc, na, mg, ca, cl-, no3- and so42- than normal rainwater. conversely, due to strong winds and dilution effect, most of the ion concentrations in harvested rainwater during typhoons were lower than in normal rainwater. in addition, biotoxicity in harvested rainwater during the dust storm and typhoons was not significantly different from that of normal rainwater.
suspension_bridge	based on the experimental data from a scaled model of the liede bridge in guangzhou, china, the nonlinear behavior of a self-anchored suspension bridge during the process of structural system transformation has been systematically and comprehensively studied. the variation of main cable deformation, hanger tension, and main girder stress during the transformation process is analyzed, and their relationships with the different states of structural system are studied. the characteristics and distribution patterns of the lateral torsional angle of spatial cable clamps are identified. in this paper, the principles of the two stages of construction control for self-anchored suspension bridges are introduced, and construction control targets and error elimination methods for each stage are also discussed. based on the measured results of an in situ static load test, the response characteristics of main cable axial deformation, hanger tension, and deflection stress of the main girder are described under the most unfavorable unbalanced loading case. the effects induced by the secondary dead and live load are obtained by a linear analysis procedure according to the accumulative theory.

construction_management	resources and environmental issues are increasingly becoming the focus of global, global economy is moving from the ""industrial and agricultural economy"" to the tertiary industry"" service economy"". modern services include consumer services and producer services. modern logistics industry is one of the major producer services, its development must depend on the appropriate logistics professionals, so building logistics professionals adaptation producing services is imperative. under the trend of producing services in the global economy, we need to review, modify, enrich and perfect the logistics management professional training scheme and teaching course system. this article first expounds the concept of producing services and the relationship between logistics and producer services, then, discusses the construction of teachers team construction and practical teaching system, from the perspective of the curriculum system, and thereby builds logistics management subject construction scheme for the private colleges under modern service industry development trend.
remote_sensing	fine-scale population distribution data at the building level play an essential role in numerous fields, for example urban planning and disaster prevention. the rapid technological development of remote sensing (rs) and geographical information system (gis) in recent decades has benefited numerous population distribution mapping studies. however, most of these studies focused on global population and environmental changes; few considered fine-scale population mapping at the local scale, largely because of a lack of reliable data and models. as geospatial big data booms, internet-collected volunteered geographic information (vgi) can now be used to solve this problem. this article establishes a novel framework to map urban population distributions at the building scale by integrating multisource geospatial big data, which is essential for the fine-scale mapping of population distributions. first, baidu points-of-interest (pois) and real-time tencent user densities (rtud) are analyzed by using a random forest algorithm to down-scale the street-level population distribution to the grid level. then, we design an effective iterative building-population gravity model to map population distributions at the building level. meanwhile, we introduce a densely inhabited index (dii), generated by the proposed gravity model, which can be used to estimate the degree of residential crowding. according to a comparison with official community-level census data and the results of previous population mapping methods, our method exhibits the best accuracy (pearson r=.8615, rmse=663.3250, p<.0001). the produced fine-scale population map can offer a more thorough understanding of inner city population distributions, which can thus help policy makers optimize the allocation of resources.
ambient_intelligence	the evolution and increasing commoditization of home and building automation systems (hbas) is contributing to their widespread adoption. however, an effort must still be made to render them usable, intelligent, highly adaptive and able to fulfill users' needs. when distinct users interact with such a system, their intentions are likely to be different, often resulting in conflicting situations, which the system ought to recognize and, if possible, resolve automatically. however, conflict detection and resolution in hbas are not yet fully understood. this work aims at investigating conflict in ambient intelligence systems, namely those supported by hbas. our main contribution is a systematization and review of existing literature concerning conflict detection and resolution in these systems.
rainwater_harvesting	understanding the receptivity, including concerns and drivers, of water-users such as householders, is vital in facilitating the promotion, appropriate installation, end-use and maintenance of rainwater harvesting (rwh) systems. this article presents the triangulated results of a literature review and survey, undertaken to increase policy-makers' understanding of householder receptivity to rwh. it was identified that overall receptivity to rwh is high, but that factors pertaining particularly to cost and maintenance pose threats to receptivity. three areas for improvement have been identified: product development, capacity building and support services, for which recommendations for action are provided. these present policy-makers with a starting point to enhance the receptivity of householders to rwh.
ambient_intelligence	the ambient intelligence (ami) paradigm applied to the healthcare sector is a promising solution to develop software-based systems capable of supporting medical procedures and activities carried out in a close, high-regulated, and complex healthcare environment. an ami healthcare system (ami-hs) which may impact on the health and life of its users (i.e. doctors, caregivers, patients, etc.) is considered as a medical device (mds), and thus subject to pass through a cumbersome risk-based regulatory process which evaluates and certifies the system safety before it is put on the market. thus, a human-centred risk analysis is of paramount importance to establish the safety level of an ami-hs. in this paper, we propose a dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (dpra) approach for ami-hs which allows the quantitative assessment of risk in different hazard scenarios in order both to support the design and development of ami-hss and to provide those objective evidences needed during the regulatory process. in addition, to support our risk-based methodology we define a probabilistic risk model (prm), based on an extension of a markov decision process (mdp), capable of taking into account two main peculiarities of ami-hss: context-awareness and personalisation. some preliminary results show the feasibility of our approach and the capability of our model to assess risk of context-aware hazard scenarios.
suspension_bridge	seismic performance of a self-anchored suspension bridge with three-tower were investigated. a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of the bridge was developed using sap2000. nonlinear time history analysis was conducted using fast nonlinear analysis method (fna), while beam-column effect and nonlinear behavior of bearing and damper were taken into consideration. the analyze results showed that the middle tower was more vulnerable compared with the two side towers; there existed risk of buckling of composite beam, and the most vulnerable part lied near steel-concrete composite segment. viscous dampers were effective to reduce seismic response of towers as well as girders.
construction_management	construction is one of the most hazardous industries due to its dynamic, temporary, and decentralized nature. the hong kong commissioner for labor identifies worker behavior as the root cause of construction accidents. behavior-based safety (bbs) is one effective approach in managing employee safety issues. however, there is little research on the application of bbs in the construction industry. this research proposes an extension of the bbs approach, proactive behavior-based safety (pbbs), to improve construction safety. pbbs integrates the theory of bbs with the technology of proactive construction management system (pcms). the innovations of pbbs are: (1) automatically monitoring location-based behaviors; (2) quantitatively measuring safety performance; (3) investigating potential causes of unsafe behaviors; and (4) improving the efficiency of safety management. a pilot study of a hong kong construction site practicing pbbs was conducted. the experiment results showed that pbbs performed well on construction accident prevention and the safety index (si) of the two project teams, with increased improvements by 36.07% and 44.70% respectively. it is concluded that pbbs is effective and adaptable to construction industry.

remote_sensing	in the central andes of argentina (30-37 degrees s), snowmelt is the main source of freshwater, an essential natural resource for similar to 2.2 million people in the adjacent arid lowlands. in this region, laguna llancanelo collects the water inputs from the malargue endorheic basin. previous studies concerning the annual and intra-annual variations of this lagoon and its relationship with regional climate are rare. we obtained a monthly record for the laguna llancanelo area (lla, 1984-2013) using the modified normalized difference water index derived from landsat images. monthly lla ranges between 35 km(2) and 411km(2) and is significantly related to variations of the rio malargue, the main snow-fed tributary to the lagoon. there is no long-term relationship between lla and local rainfall, but rapid increases in lla result from heavy rainfall around the lagoon. conversely, rapid reductions in lla encompass periods with both reduced discharge from the rio malargue and low local rainfall. the lla integrates moisture of both pacific (snowfall in the upper andes) and atlantic (lowland rainfall) origins; therefore, we propose using lla as an indicator of regional water balance.
solar_energy	sorption heat storage has the potential to store large amounts of thermal energy from renewables and other distributed energy sources. this article provides an overview on the recent advancements on long-term sorption heat storage at material- and prototype- scales. the focus is on applications requiring heat within a temperature range of 30-150 degrees c such as space heating, domestic hot water production, and some industrial processes. at material level, emphasis is put on solid/gas reactions with water as sorbate. in particular, salt hydrates, adsorbents, and recent advancements on composite materials are reviewed. most of the investigated salt hydrates comply with requirements such as safety and availability at low cost. however, hydrothermal stability issues such as deliquescence and decomposition at certain operating conditions make their utilization in a pure form challenging. adsorbents are more hydrothermally stable but have lower energy densities and higher prices. composite materials are investigated to reduce hydrothermal instabilities while achieving acceptable energy densities and material costs. at prototype-scale, the article provides an updated review on system prototypes based on the reviewed materials. both open and closed system layouts are addressed, together with the main design issues such as heat and mass transfer in the reactors and materials corrosion resistance. especially for open systems, the focus is on pure adsorbents rather than salt hydrates as active materials due to their better stability. however, high material costs and desorption temperatures, coupled with lower energy densities at typical system operating conditions, decrease their commercial attractiveness. among the main conclusions, the implementation within the scientific community of common key performance indicators is suggested together with the inclusion of economic aspects already at material-scale investigations.

smart_material	electromechanical impedance-based structural health monitoring method had attracted several researchers in the recent past for aerospace, civil, mechanical, timber and biological structures. smart materials such as piezoelectric (lead zirconate titanate) and macro fibre composite transducers are either surface bonded or embedded inside the host structure to be monitored. these smart materials with an applied input sinusoidal voltage interact with the structure, to sense, measure, process and detect any change in the selected variables (stress, damage) at critical locations. these can be categorized as wire-based 'advanced non-destructive testing', wireless-based 'battery-powered lead zirconate titanate/macro fibre composite' and energy harvesting-based 'self-powered lead zirconate titanate/macro fibre composite' methods. most importantly, the effectiveness of these electromechanical impedance-methods can be classified into active and passive based on the properties of the material, the component and the structure to be monitored. furthermore, they also depend on variables to be monitored and interaction mechanism due to surface bonding or embedment. this article presents some of the important developments in monitoring and the path forward in wired, wireless and energy harvesting methods related to electromechanical impedance-based structural health monitoring for metals and non-metals.

smart_material	a piezoelectric-based hydraulic actuator is a type of piston-cylinder device which is operated by internal flow energy. recently, an artificial muscle and a micro actuator have been developed using a new smart material and internal flow control. thus, the actuating velocity of the fabricated integrated hybrid system was investigated using the pumping frequency and load weight. the actuating velocity was then calculated using a developed program, and the numerical result was compared with the experimental result to validate the numerical program. also, the internal flow rate was measured to analyze the pump efficiency experimentally. the flow rate inside the integrated hybrid actuator calculated using a cfd program for various pumping frequencies was then compared with the experimental results. the maximum outlet velocity was obtained at the pumping frequency of 35 hz and the velocity decreased from that point due to flow loss.
construction_management	as building information modeling (bim) systems continue to be widely adopted, there is an increasing demand for an active construction schedule management system with more advanced decision-making capabilities. for example, if overlapping between construction activities is significant, the performance of construction operations for the corresponding activities may deteriorate. thus, a viable construction schedule should be formulated in order to minimize overlapping of proximate construction activities. an active system can be regarded as a certain solution for this issue. the purpose of this study is to develop a systematic methodology and computer system for an optimal construction schedule simulation that minimize overlapping activities for the enhancement of a project 's operational performance. this study centers on identifying overlapping activities, applying fuzzy theory, and analyzing risk levels for schedule overlap issues. in addition, genetic algorithm (ga) theory is adopted for the minimization of the overlapping of highly risky activities. finally, an optimal construction schedule that minimizes overlapping activities is suggested. the optimal schedule is visualized in a bim-based four-dimensional (4d) computer-aided design (cad) environment. the 4d cad system developed in this study includes fuzzy and ga analysis functions with a schedule simulator. a case study on an actual project is introduced to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
solar_energy	indium, cadmium and tin based transparent conducting oxide (tco) films have low thermal emissivity values and these are suitable for energy efficient applications where controlling of thermal effect is an important factor. among these films antimony doped indium oxide (iao) coated glass has been explored to have resistivity similar to 2 x 10(-2)omega cm. the film is homogeneous and good adherence to glass even in large dimensions [500 mm x 500 mm]. this film possesses emissivity similar to 0.63 and it has been taken as the standard for the calculation of solar factor (g,) and absorbed solar energy reradiated and convected indoors (ei) of transparent conducting oxide (tco) films of 32 types. as calculated, the g, and e, values of a tco films are in the ranges 0.77-0.02 and 2.9-59w m(-2) respectively. attempt has been made to use the iao coated glass to improve glazing system in solar cooker with the principle that lowering of gi and e, values would correspond to significant increase of heat insulation property. the thermal performance of solar cooker box having a cover of single layer low-e iao coated glass was compared with the solar cooker box having a cover of uncoated double glaze soda lime silicate (sls) glass initially and finally with the same solar cooker box with evacuated glazed cover maintaining vacuum (10(-3) atrn) in the glazing system. thermal performance of the solar cookers at ambient condition differs due to the variation of heat flow through glass cover with different glazing systems. the perforinance was promising for the solar cooker box with the cover of single glazed low-e ia0 coated glass. the added advantages for domestic usage are low cost of production, relatively light weight and high mechanical durability along with relatively high thermal output.

suspension_bridge	this study conducted a cfd-2d coupled analysis of a suspension bridge subjected to wind loads. previous studies found that rotational oscillation was due to differences in the restoring force at hanger cables and could generate torsional oscillations. however, due to uncertain external force terms, the previous studies could not be applied to analyze actual structures. to enable application in a real design process, this study proposed a methodology for determining the external force terms. the external force terms were determined with cfd, and a moment force term was added to equations of motion derived from dynamic equilibrium conditions. all constants and properties were calculated from an assumed cross section of superstructure. this methodology can be used not only to avoid torsional resonance but also in preliminary analysis in the bridge design stage.
ambient_intelligence	intelligent cameras, or smart cameras as they are often referred to, appear ubiquitously in our everyday lives, both at home and at work. in our pockets, bags, cars and homes we are now experiencing and interacting with a new generation of smart cameras that far surpass the ability to merely capture images - they can provide high-level descriptions of the environment and analyse what they see. recently, researchers at de montfort university have developed a low-cost, low-power intelligent camera system that incorporates a 2.8"" touchscreen and a fisheye lens, is capable of capturing visual environment data, performing algorithms to extract metrics and wirelessly transmit them to the cloud for further analysis. having the advantage of a short focal length and wide field of view, our fisheye camera system can provide information for a multidisciplinary audience including image processing, camera technology and embedded systems, and support a wide variety of applications such as surveillance, home monitoring, motion analysis, facial identification and intelligent transportation systems. this paper describes a first generation prototype camera system that gathers luminance data by capturing high dynamic range (hdr) imagery that is comparable to the data acquired with costly and cumbersome research equipment. the paper also explores the requirements for, benefits of, and challenges faced when developing an even smarter intelligent camera system.
smart_material	tuned mass damper (tmd) as a kind of passive vibration reduction device, has widely used in engineering structures. howerver, the damping effect of traditional tmd would decrease dramatically even there is only a small change of the main structure 's dynamic characteristics. as a new kind of smart material, the stiffness of magnetorheological (mre) would change with the change of magnetic field applied. so we can change the stiffness of mre to adjust the natural frequency of tmd. based on this idea, we have proposed a new kind of frequency adjustable tmd based on mre. while the magnetorheological effect and the deformation of mre are mutually restricted, the allowable small deformation of mre cannot meet the actual substantially deformation of tmd. in this paper, the deformation of mre is enlarged by the gear disk which greatly increases the amplitude of the frequency adjustable tmd based on mre, and then the mechanical model of this new device is deduced. on the basis of this, the natural frequencies of the main structures are identified by the combination of the hilbert-huang transform (heit) and the random decrement technique (rdt). a better damping effect can be achieved by changing the external magneitci field of this new kind of tmd to track the natural frequencies of the main structure. lastly, a pedestrian brige is used as the engineering background and the simulation of vibration control use frequency adjustable tmd is calculated. the results show that, compared to traditional tmd the damping effect of this frequency adjustable tmd is hardly affected by the change of main structure 's natural frequency. there are a wider vibration frequency, a more stable damping effect and a better deformation capacity of this frequency adjustable tmd.
green_building	providing itemized energy consumption in a utility bill is becoming a priority, and perhaps a business practice in the near term. in recent times, a multitude of systems have been developed such as smart plugs, smart circuit breakers etc., for non-intrusive load monitoring (nilm). they are integrated either with the smart meters or at the plug-levels to footprint appliance-level energy consumption patterns in an entire home environment. while deploying the existing technologies in a single home is feasible, scaling these technological advancements across thousands of homes in a region is not realized yet. this is primarily due to the cost, deployment complexity, and intrusive nature associated with these types of real deployment. motivated by these shortcomings, in this paper we investigate the first step to address scalable disaggregation by proposing a disaggregation mechanism that works on a large dataset to accurately deconstruct the cumulative signals. we propose an iterative noise separation based approach to perform energy disaggregation using sparse coding based methodologies which work at the single ingress point of a home, i.e., at the meter level. we performed a ranked iterative signal removal methodology that effectively isolates appliances' individual signal waveform as noise on an aggregate energy datasets with moderate granularity (1 min). we performed experiments on real dataset and obtained approximately 94% energy disaggregation, i.e., disaggregated appliance-wise signal estimation accuracy.
water_pollution	discharge of olive mill wastewater (omww) into rivers system in crete had led to heavy organic pollution and several drastic environmental impacts. the current research study aims to map and evaluate the environmental hazards initiated by olive mill wastewater pollution discharged into surface stream network of kolymvari agricultural area located in western crete, greece. implemented methodology is based on locating source points of pollution and determining pollutant surface flow paths under gis environment. hydrological features of the area were delineated in the gis environment using basically elevation data provided by the ministry of agriculture. on a microscale, it was proved that the implementation of mca can quantify the environmental risk to surface water resources caused by omww. on a macroscale, risk mapping was implemented by establishing a spatial connection between the source points of pollution and the possible sedimentation areas. furthermore, mapping of olive mill waste tanks will positively improve the exercised methodology in term of assessing the potential risks of soil and groundwater pollution.
water_pollution	this study focuses on four textile industries (dh-geda, noya, almhadi, and alsar) established between 2005 and 2008 in the peri-urban areas of dukem and gelan. the objectives of the study were to generate baseline information regarding the concentration levels of selected pollutants and to analyze their effects on biophysical environments. this study also attempts to explore the level of exposure that humans and livestock have to polluted effluents and the effects thereof. the findings of this study are based on data empirically collected from two sources: laboratory analysis of sample effluents from the four selected textile plants and quantitative as well as qualitative socioeconomic data collection. as part of the latter, a household survey and focus group discussions (fgds) with elderly and other focal persons were employed in the towns of dukem and gelan. the results of the study show that large concentrations of biological oxygen demand (bod5), chemical oxygen demand (cod), total suspended solids (tss), and ph were found in all the observed textile industries, at levels beyond the permissible discharge limit set by the national environmental protection authority (epa). furthermore, sulfide (s-2), r-phosphate (r-po43), and zn were found in large concentrations in dh-geda and almhadi, while high concentrations were also identified in samples taken from alsar and almhadi. in spite of the clear-cut legal tools, this study shows that the local environment, people, and their livestock are exposed to highly contaminated effluents. we therefore recommend that the respective federal and regional government bodies should reexamine the compliance to and actual implementation of the existing legal procedures and regulations and respond appropriately.
remote_sensing	ningbo city in zhejiang province is one of the largest port cities in china and has achieved high economic development during the past decades. the port construction, land reclamation, urban development and silt deposition in the ningbo coastal zone have resulted in extensive coastline change. in this study, the spatio-temporal change of the ningbo coastlines during 1976-2015 was detected and analysed using landsat time-series images from different sensors, including multispectral scanner (mss), thematic mapper (tm), enhanced thematic mapper plus (etm+) and operational land imager (oli). fourteen individual scenes (covering seven phases) of cloud-free landsat images within the required tidal range of +/- 63 cm were collected. the ziyuan-3 (zy-3) image of 2015 was used to extract the reference coastline for the accuracy assessment. the normalised difference water index (ndwi) and the modified normalized difference water index (mndwi) were applied to discriminate surface water and land features, respectively. the on-screen digitising approach was then used to further refine the extracted time-series coastlines in the period from 1976 to 2015. six relevant indices, length, length change, annual length change, fractal dimension (fd), average net shoreline movement (nsm) and average annual nsm, were calculated to analyse and explore the spatio-temporal change features of ningbo coastlines. results show that the length of the ningbo coastlines increased from 910 km to 986 km, and the value of fd increased from 1.09 to 1.12, and the coastline morphology changed from sinuous to straight. the average nsm increased from 187 m to 298 m and the average annual nsm reached 85 m/year, indicating the advance of coastlines towards the sea at a high level. the spatio-temporal change patterns also varied in different areas. in hangzhou bay, significant advancement along the coastlines was experienced since 2001 mainly because of urban construction and land reclamation. in xiangshan bay, the forces of nature played a major role in coastline dynamics before 2008, whilst port construction, urban construction and island link projections moved the coastlines towards the sea. the coastline changes of sanmen bay were affected by the interaction of nature and human activities. all these observations indicate that forces of nature and human activities were the two important influential factors for the observed coastline change. in this case, the coastline complexity variation was considered responsible for various coastline patterns change of the ningbo coast. in addition, erosion and accretion occurred in turn because of forces of nature and human activities, such as urban development and agricultural exploitation.
ambient_intelligence	this paper introduces a smart assistant for professional volleyball training based on machine-learning techniques (saeta). saeta addresses two main aspects of elite sports coaching: 1) technical-tactical effort control, which aims at controlling exercise effort and fatigue levels and 2) exercise quality training, which complements the former by analyzing the execution of player movements. saeta relies on a sensing infrastructure that monitors both players and their environment, and produces real-time data that is analyzed by different modules of a decision engine. technical-tactical effort control is based on a dynamic programming model, which selects the best activity and rest durations in interval training, with the goal of maximizing effort while preventing fatigue. exercise quality control consists of two stages. in the first stage, movements are detected by means of a k-nearest neighbors classifier and in the second stage, movement intensity is classified according to recent statistical data from the player being analyzed. these analyses are reported to coaches and players in real-time. saeta has been developed in close collaboration with the universidad catolica san antonio de murcia volleyball team, which competes in the spanish women 's premier league. data gathered during training sessions has provided a knowledge base for the algorithms developed, and has been used for the validation of results.

water_pollution	while rising air and water pollution have become issues of widespread public concern in india, the relationship between spatial distribution of environmental pollution and social disadvantage has received less attention. this lack of attention becomes particularly relevant in the context of industrial pollution, as india continues to pursue industrial development policies without sufficient regard to its adverse social impacts. this letter examines industrial pollution in india from an environmental justice (ej) perspective by presenting a national scale study of social inequities in the distribution of industrial hazardous waste generation. our analysis connects district-level data from the 2009 national inventory of hazardous waste generating industries with variables representing urbanization, social disadvantage, and socioeconomic status from the 2011 census of india. our results indicate that more urbanized and densely populated districts with a higher proportion of socially and economically disadvantaged residents are significantly more likely to generate hazardous waste. the quantity of hazardous waste generated is significantly higher in more urbanized but sparsely populated districts with a higher proportion of economically disadvantaged households, after accounting for other relevant explanatory factors such as literacy and social disadvantage. these findings underscore the growing need to incorporate ej considerations in future industrial development and waste management in india.

ambient_intelligence	ambient-assisted living (aal) is currently one of the important research and development areas, where accessibility, usability, and learning play a major role and where future interfaces are an important concern for applied engineering. the general goal of aal solutions is to apply ambient intelligence technology to enable people with specific demands, e.g., handicapped or elderly, to live in their preferred environment longer. the term ""internet of things"" (iot) is used as an umbrella keyword for covering various aspects related to the extension of the internet and the web into the physical realm, by means of the widespread deployment of spatially distributed devices with embedded identification, sensing and/or actuation capabilities. in this context, we propose a new methodology based on self organizing maps (soms) and fuzzy c-means (fcm) algorithms for profile generation as regards the activities of the user and their correlation with the available sensors. moreover, we utilize the provided context to assign the generated profiles to more contextually complex activities. our methodology is being evaluated into an aal structure equipped with several sensors. more precisely, we assess the proposed method in a data set generated by accelerometers and its performance over a number of everyday activities.
remote_sensing	this paper explores the influence of flight altitude, terrain morphology, and the number of ground control points (gcps) on digital surface model (dsm) and orthoimage accuracies obtained with unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) photogrammetry. for this study, 60 photogrammetric projects were carried out considering five terrain morphologies, four flight altitudes (i.e., 50, 80, 100, and 120 m), and three different numbers of gcps (i.e., 3, 5, and 10). the uav was a rotatory wing platform with eight motors, and the sensor was a nonmetric mirrorless reflex camera. the root-mean-square error (rmse) was used to assess the accuracy of the dsm (z component) and orthophotos (x, y, and xy components rmsex, rmsey, and rmsexy, respectively). the results show that rmsex, rmsey, and rmsexy were not influenced by flight altitude or terrain morphology. for horizontal accuracy, differences between terrain morphologies were observed only when 5 or 10 gcps were used, which were the best accuracies for the flattest morphologies. nevertheless, the number of gcps influenced the horizontal accuracy; as the number of gcps increased, the accuracy improved. vertical accuracy was not influenced by terrain morphology, but both flight altitude and the number of gcps had significant influences on rmsez; as the number of gcps increased, the accuracy improved. regarding flight altitude, vertical accuracy decreased as flight altitude increased. the most accurate combination of flight altitude and number of gcps was 50 m and 10 gcps, respectively, which yielded rmsex, rmsey, rmsexy, and rmsez values equal to 0.038, 0.035, 0.053, and 0.049 m, respectively. in view of these results, the map scale according to the legacy american society for photogrammetry and remote sensing map standard of 1990 will be approximately 1:150, and an equivalent contour interval of 0.150 m is sufficient for most civil engineering projects.

solar_energy	photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, one of the pathways involved in the carbon dioxide conversion process, has been receiving significant attention from the scientific community in the last four decades. nevertheless, the mechanism of carbon dioxide reduction is still unclear and the information available is not sufficient for developing it into large scale applications, possibly because of the invariable hurdles associated with the reduction process. the reductive photocatalytic conversion of co2 involves all the redox reactions occurring at the interface of the semiconductor such as water splitting, hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, photo-oxidation reactions and reactions of radical intermediates. the overall product yield is highly dependent on the extent of these competing reactions. herein, we discuss our perceptions and current status of the interface reactions and their involvement in the fundamental mechanistic aspects of the photocatalytic conversion of co2.

green_building	benchmarks are required to determine the environmental performance of new buildings. through lca, this study assessed the environmental impacts of 23 elementary school buildings in south korea. by conducting statistical analysis (pearson correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and mann-whitney test), gross floor area, latitude, and longitude were influence factors which cause the differences in environmental impacts among buildings. the differences in environmental impacts by gross floor area can be considered by defining the functional unit as one square meter of floor area. the differences in environmental impacts by region can be considered after dividing 23 elementary school buildings according to latitude and longitude. based on the results of the two-step cluster analysis and the mann-whitney test on latitude and longitude, the environmental impacts of 23 elementary school buildings were divided into two clusters, with the exception of human carcinogenic potential and human non-carcinogenic potential. therefore, this study presented the benchmarks in two clusters. for instance, the benchmarks for global warming potential in clusters one and two were 3.70e+03 and 2.53e+03 kg-co2 eq./m(2), respectively. the benchmark for the human carcinogenic potential was 8.63e-08 cases(can)/m(2). the benchmarks are expected to be used in deterinining the environmental performance of new elementary school buildings.

stealth_technology	optical cloaking has been one of unattainable dreams and just a subject in fiction until recently. several different approaches to cloaking have been proposed and demonstrated: stealth technology, active camouflage and transformation optics. the last one would be the most formal approach modifying electromagnetic field around an object to be cloaked with metamaterials. while cloaking based on transformation optics, though valid only at single frequency, is experimentally demonstrated in microwave region, its operation in visible spectrum is still distant from realisation mainly owing to difficulty in fabricating metamaterial structure whose elements are much smaller than wavelength of light. here we show that achromatic optical cloaking in visible spectrum is possible with the mere principle based on geometrical optics. in combining a pair of polarising beam splitters and right-angled prisms, rays of light to be obstructed by an object can make a detour to an observer, while unobstructed rays go straight through two polarising beam splitters. what is observed eventually through the device is simply background image as if nothing exists in between.
suspension_bridge	compared with traditional suspension footbridges, the cable-truss footbridge is always easier to satisfy structure deformation requirements under small dead-load-to-live-load ratio condition, and it enjoys surging popularity in western china. in this type of bridges, the deck system is designed as a pure local load-bearing member, and the inverse pre-tensioned deck cable system is set up to form a tension-tension mechanical system. to better understand its structural performance, a simplified structural mechanics model for cable-truss footbridges is proposed, and the analytical formulations for deformation and internal forces of the bridge under entire span live load as well as semi-span live load have been derived. the reliability and accuracy of the proposed model have been validated in a comparison study with the finite element analysis. furthermore, a series of qualitative and quantitative parametric studies have been conducted, which reveal that the cable-truss bridges have several novel structural characteristics that differ from that of traditional suspension bridges. finally, the affordability range of cable-truss bridges is also discussed by using material usage analysis.

rainwater_harvesting	this paper quantifies some of the economic benefits that a culture of rainwater harvesting could produce in the case of bogota. the study makes projections of future water needs until 2035, based on local economy and population growth as determining variables of water service needs. it also discusses the appropriateness of promoting water harvesting as a strategy to manage the urgent situation caused by the limitations that climate change would provoke on the water supply of the city. projected water supply needs for the growing population evidence the need of an increase of 37.6% in the supply capacity of drinking water for the localities that make up the urban area of bogota. the article concludes that rainwater harvesting would generate significant savings in water and water supply costs for users and for the state.
solar_energy	the current study concerns the fundamental problems of legionnaires disease. four decades after legionnaires' bacteria was first identified there is still a low level of clinical awareness. humans are infected by inhalation of aerosolized water and/or soil contaminated with the bacteria. several control methods are available for water disinfection: biocide, ultraviolet light sterilization, copper-silver ionization, ozonation etc. but only thermal treatment can completely eliminate legionella, which is killed almost instantly at 70 degrees c. the current paper describes legionella disinfection by a solar concentrator combined with a heat recovery system that reduces the heat demand. though this study is made for a small system (1601 of hot water per day) the system can be enlarged (more hot water and more solar collector area) and the results are thus valid also for such larger systems. here experiments of water treatment by a solar concentrator are summarized and analyzed where the temperature exceeds 80 degrees c at the outlet of the heat exchanger.

rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting is seen as part of solution to avoid water shortage in the future as it offers a sufficient supply and more economical if compare to the conventional way. the scarcity of water supply is becoming a concern due to the growing population of human along with environment pollutions. rainwater harvesting is considered the most accessible source which could be easily used for potable purposes both for household and commercial activities. therefore, in this study, the physical, microbiological and chemical rainwater quality samples were analyzed using membrane filtration technique (ele paqualab 50), icp-oes and hach methods, to ensure the suitability of rainwater harvesting for domestic consumption. the study reveals that overall quality of the rainwater is quite satisfactory as per who and malaysian standards, where the ph, turbidity, total dissolved solids, salinity, no3-, so42-, zn and pb were still under the permissible limits. however, the microbiological parameters (total coliform, fecal coliform and e. coli) and chemical (cr) were found exceeded the standards, due to poor hygienic practices of the harvesting system. it can be concluded that the rainwater harvesting is still safe to drink and can be a potential alternative source of water supply in the future.

construction_management	purpose - small and medium sized enterprises (smes), which form a significant portion in many economies, are some of the most vulnerable to the impact of extreme weather events (ewes). this is of particular importance to the construction industry, as an overarching majority of construction companies are smes who account for the majority of employment and income generation within the industry. in the uk, previous research has identified construction smes as some of the worst affected by ewes. the paper aims to discuss these issues. design/methodology/approach - given the recent occurrences of ewes and predictions suggesting increases in both the intensity and frequency of ewes in the future, improving the resilience of construction smes is vital for achieving a resilient construction industry. a conceptual framework is first developed which is then populated and expanded based on empirical evidence. positioned within a pragmatic research philosophy, case study research strategy was adopted as the overall research strategy in undertaking this investigation. findings - based on the findings of two in-depth case studies of construction smes, a framework was developed to represent ewe resilience of construction smes, where resilience was seen as a collective effect of vulnerability, coping strategies, and coping capacities of smes, characteristics of the ewe and the wider economic climate. originality/value - the paper provides an original contribution towards the overarching agenda of the resilience of smes, and policy making in the area of ewe risk management by presenting a novel conceptual framework depicting the resilience of medium sized construction companies.
remote_sensing	we explore the potential for using a small unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) quadcopter to collect long-dwell imagery of the nearshore from which important measurements can be made at low cost and with flexibility. this paper extends the existing topographic imaging approaches that rely on having plentiful ground control spread across the image, to the nearshore case where the bulk of the image is water with no control point and vehicle metadata must be used. the uav autopilot was found to be capable of excellent station-keeping with the positional errors of 0.20 and 0.53 m (horizontal and vertical) and the viewing angle errors of 0.25 degrees (tilt and roll) and 0.38 degrees (azimuth). the ground position of imaged objects could be found with 0.21-m accuracy. metadata returned by the uav on camera position was accurate at 5 m, and the camera roll could be assumed to be 0 degrees, reducing the ground control requirements to two, or even one location. even under this extreme simplification, ground position errors averaged only 10 m but were worse for cases when only control points near to the uav were used. a model for the visual contrast of waves when viewed from different angles found that large tilts are important but, in contrast to theory, that there was little dependence on the viewing azimuthal angle. derived argus products agreed well with the same products collected using a traditional fixed argus station. uavs appear to be a very promising alternate to fixed camera systems if limited duration sampling is adequate.
rainwater_harvesting	the crop production in the district of kasaragod in kerala state (india) is characterized by low input-low yield concept and rain-fed agriculture. a field study was conducted in western ghat region of the district to develop a suitable rainwater harvesting system adoptable to hilly terrains and to test its efficacy for improving the use efficiency of the harvested water by its multiple uses. the cost-benefit analysis of the water harvesting system was also carried out to find out its affordability to farmers. the water harvesting system has been developed by integrating three components: (i) improving the productivity of coconut and component crops in the cropping units (ii) developing multiple water use systems, and (iii) the conjunctive use of the harvested water along with other surface and groundwater resources. based on the estimated annual costs and returns, the benefit -cost ratio was found to be 1.69 and all other financial viability criteria (irr and npv) were also found favourable for investment on a lined water harvesting tank integrated with a micro-irrigation system and fish farming. the study suggested that the rainwater harvesting could be implemented as a viable alternative to conventional water supply or on-farm irrigation projects considering the fact that any land anywhere can be used to harvest rainwater. further, the water use efficiency can be improved through effective harvesting and subsequent multiple uses of stored water.
construction_management	labor productivity has a profound impact on construction management. the accurate prediction of productivity is essential to effectively plan operations that depend on time and cost and is critical for the success of a construction project for both the contractor and the owner. however, predicting productivity of operations is challenging due to the multiple characteristics of workers, the interrelationships between workers, and the site conditions that impact the performance of crews and affect project goals. this paper proposes a methodology to quantify the factors that affect productivity in masonry construction. we have considered three factors: compatibility, suitability, and craft. standardized data-collection techniques are used to consolidate data from three masonry sites and mathematically define a productivity function that relates workers characteristics and crews with site conditions. the function, increasing in its arguments, determines the factors that most affect masonry productivity and the factor 's effects. the most interesting part is to be able to identify the convexity properties of this function because its theoretical interpretation will have implications on the impact of the superintendent 's decisions when forming crews. the proposed mathematical function can enable superintendents to better plan, schedule, and manage masonry crews.

construction_management	with the increasing scale of construction projects, coupled with their complexity, information management in the construction process becomes more complex and trivial. moreover, the communication among project participants is hindered by the large amount and scattered structure of the information involved in the construction process. most present studies on the information management of construction focus on the special needs of construction sectors rather than a total information integration of general aspects. this paper presents a multidimensional information model that combines workflow, work breakdown structures (wbs) and time factor to manage information based on process control. unlike previous researches, the present work puts emphasis on process control to enhance the communication process. the proposed information model uses the wbs and time factor to manage information in the spatial and time dimension and control the process information of each work package during project execution through the workflow technology. in order to test the proposed information model, a web-based project management system (wpms) was developed using the three layer architecture. the system structure realizes the invisible logic of the information model through the business logic layer and the data access layer. the system has been applied to a construction project of an underground cavern group in a hydropower project in the southwest of china. the application has shown that it achieves managing information based on process control and provides structured information.
water_pollution	for the many application domains concerning entities and their connections, often their data can be formally represented as graphs and an important problem is detecting an anomalous subgraph within it. numerous methods have been proposed to speed-up anomalous subgraph detection; however, each incurs non-trivial costs on detection accuracy. in this paper, we formulate the anomalous subgraph detection problem as the maximization of a non-parametric scan statistic and then approximate it to a submodular maximization problem. we propose two parallel algorithms: non-coordination anomalous subgraph detection (ncasd) and under-coordination anomalous subgraph detection (ucasd) for the anomalous subgraph detection. to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to solve this problem in parallel. ncasd emphasizes speed at the expense of approximation guarantees, while ucasd achieves a higher approximation factor through additional coordination controls and reduced parallelism. the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches in a real-world application domain (water pollution detection), comparing them with five other state-of-the-art methods. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.

smart_material	this paper presents the nonlinear dynamic analysis of a structural system with shape memory alloy members. a new time integration scheme is proposed for solving the differential equation of motion obtained for this system. in the new implicit method, it is assumed that the acceleration varies quadratically within each time step. more terms of taylor series is used by increasing the order of acceleration which expected to have responses with better accuracy than the classical methods. by adopting the above assumption, a new family of unconditionally stable procedures is obtained. two dynamic loading cases are considered for the numerical example in which the structure is analyzed with elastoplastic behavior as well as structure enhanced with superelastic shape memory alloy connections. the findings display that nonlinear dynamic analysis conducted on such structures showed to be very efficient and accurate. it is also found that, shape memory alloy permits system to recover the initial configuration at the end of the deformation process. the recovery takes place without any residual strains, while dissipating a considerable amount of energy.

rainwater_harvesting	this paper presents an investment feasibility analysis of rainwater harvesting systems for the residential sector in santa catarina state, southern brazil. five towns were selected for the analysis. daily rainfall data, average water consumption, rainwater tank costs, water pump costs, and water, sewage and electricity tariffs were obtained for the five towns. different values for the roof area, number of residents, potable water demand, and rainwater demand were analysed. the rainwater tank capacities were estimated using the netuno computer programme. the investment feasibility analysis was performed considering the ideal lower tank capacity, as well as capacities smaller and larger than the ideal. such capacities were obtained according to a variation of six months in the payback period. it was observed that the ideal tank capacity can be conservative for high rainwater demands. in such cases, an investment feasibility analysis should be performed in order to obtain a more appropriate tank capacity. the main conclusion is that rainwater usage is economically feasible for most cases; and the higher the rainwater demand, the higher the feasibility.
green_building	the innovation of building information modelling (bim) technology provides a new means of predicting, managing and monitoring the environmental impacts of project construction and development through virtual prototyping/visualisation technology. this paper aims to provide thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the existing green bim literature, and outlines the most important directions for future research. a total of 84 green-bim-related papers have been reviewed and compared. most green bim research, centres on environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. few studies concentrated on the development of bim-based tools for managing environmental performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers), and demolition (12 papers) stages. it is suggested that a 'one-stop-shop' bim for environmental sustainability monitoring and management over a building 's full life cycle should be considered in future research. future green bim tools should also include the three r 's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis for both new development and retrofitting projects. the system should offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for more effective low-carbon management. the use of cloud-based bim technology to enable the management of building sustainability using 'big data' is also needed. despite these potential developments, it is argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the bim models are hindering the adoption of green bim.

solar_energy	solar thermal fuels (stfs) harvest and store solar energy in a closed cycle system through conformational change of molecules and can release the energy in the form of heat on demand. with the aim of developing tunable and optimized stfs for solid-state applications, we designed three azobenzene derivatives functionalized with bulky aromatic groups (phenyl, biphenyl, and tert-butyl phenyl groups). in contrast to pristine azobenzene, which crystallizes and makes nonuniform films, the bulky azobenzene derivatives formed uniform amorphous films that can be charged and discharged with light and heat for many cycles. thermal stability of the films, a critical metric for thermally triggerable stfs, was greatly increased by the bulky functionalization (up to 180 degrees c), and we were able to achieve record high energy density of 135 j/g for solid-state stfs, over a 30% improvement compared to previous solid-state reports. furthermore, the chargeability in the solid state was improved, up to 80% charged from 40% charged in previous solid-state reports. our results point toward molecular engineering as an effective method to increase energy storage in stfs, improve chargeability, and improve the thermal stability of the thin film.
rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting in small dams has good potential to provide supplementary agricultural irrigation during critical crop growth stages. field experiments were conducted to evaluate cropping patterns: fallow-wheat (fw), mash-wheat (maw), sorghum-wheat (sw), maize (grain)-wheat (mw), maize (grain)-gram (mg) and mung-canola (muc); under two conditions: irrigated (command area of pira fatehial small dam) and rainfed (un-command area) on sandy loam soil during three years (2009 to 2011). treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design, three factor factorial (cropping patterns, irrigated/non-irrigated conditions and years) using four replications. the highest grain yield of wheat (5.6mgha(-1)) was obtained from the maw cropping pattern as compared to those from mw, fw and sw cropping patterns. summer crops (sorghum fodder, maize grain and mash) performed excellent under irrigated conditions. water use efficiency of wheat (14.3kgha(-1)mm(-1)) following mash under both the conditions exhibited higher values than when compared with those from sw, fw and mw cropping patterns. however, nutrient use efficiency in sw cropping pattern surpassed the others. performance of all crops remained better under the irrigated condition during both all seasons and years, as rainfall deficiency was compensated by supplementary irrigations. hence, this study concluded that farmers having water resources for supplemental irrigation should adopt the mw cropping pattern, based on grain yield, efficient utilization of available supplemental water and better utilization of nutrients. similarly, based on improved nutrient utilization and monitory outputs, the maw sequence should be followed in rain-fed areas for better resource management. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
suspension_bridge	in this paper we scrutinize the asymptotic behavior of a nonlinear problem which models the vertical vibrations of a suspension bridge. the single-span road-bed is modeled as an extensible viscoelastic beam which is simply supported at the ends. it is suspended to a rigid and immovable frame by means of a distributed system of vertical one-sided elastic springs. a constant axial force p is applied at one end of the deck, and time-independent vertical loads are allowed. for this model we obtain original results, including the existence of a regular global attractor for all in spite of the extremely weak dissipation due to the convolution term, this result is achieved by exploiting the exponential decay of the memory kernel.
suspension_bridge	an enhanced nonstationary buffeting force model for calculating tropical storm (i.e., typhoon/hurricane)-induced buffeting response of long-span bridges is presented. the evolutionary power spectral density (epsd) in the existing nonstationary tropical storm wind model is first revisited and enhanced by taking into consideration the recently-proposed typhoon turbulence spectra. a coherence transfer function matrix and time-dependent aerodynamic admittance function are introduced to eliminate the strip and quasi-steady theory assumptions by way of implementing wind tunnel measured span-wise and chord-wise coherence of aerodynamic forces. finally, the non-linearity in the buffeting forces resulting from the variations in the instant effective angle of attack and the nonuniform span-wise profile of the mean wind speed are considered in the enhanced model. the influence of the aforementioned enhancements in the nonstationary buffeting force model on the tropical storm-induced buffeting response of long-span bridges is assessed through the example of the stonecutters bridge subjected to typhoon dujuan. the results suggest that the enhanced epsd model of tropical storm winds, nonlinearity due to the instant effective angle of attack, and the variations in the velocity span-wise profile slightly change the buffeting responses. however, introduction of the span-wise coherence of buffeting forces increases nonstationary extreme responses by 25-40%, and the time-dependent admittance function reduces the extreme responses by as much as 70%.

ambient_intelligence	home environments are one of the subjects of study regarding ambient intelligent systems for various purposes, including development of assistance systems for the elderly and energy consumption optimization. sensing the environmental state via different sensors is the first and crucial component of every ambient intelligent system. in this work we investigate the use of environmental sounds for touch-free audio-based device recognition in a home environment. for this purpose, we analyzed sound characteristics of typical home appliances using different processing techniques. we are using the acquired knowledge to develop a flexible set of features, which can be set manually or determined automatically. to classify the device-specific acoustic fingerprints consisting of a significant subset of our features - we use established supervised learning techniques, whereby we optimized the straightforward ones. after building a recognition basis for the recognition of fixed length sound buffers on demand, we implemented a live recognition mode for real-time environment monitoring, providing runtime setup adjustments. we then extended our work with the recognition of untrained, simultaneously working, known devices by mixing their records, utilizing semi-supervised learning. we then anticipated promising results in our evaluation in various aspects, including recognition rate, performance for the different combinations of features, as well as to study the reliability of an automatic mixing of trained data.
construction_management	purpose - leadership is a significant success factor in promoting sustainability practices in the construction industry. sustainability is an integral part of the construction industry and affects all aspects of construction business operations. the purpose of this paper is to investigate if there is any particular leadership style associated with intra-organizational leaders within uk construction organizations charged with the promotion of sustainability practices. the paper therefore examines the effective leadership style of sustainability professionals responsible for developing sustainable construction strategies. design/methodology/approach - qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interview with 15 leaders, followed by an industry-wide survey of 200 intra-organizational leaders in contractor and consultant organizations in the uk construction industry. findings - the results showed that while there is no one best leadership style for all situation, most leaders charged with the role of promoting sustainable construction are strategic in their style or behaviour. originality/value - although leadership and sustainability has been widely covered as separate issues, little rigorous research has been done on the link between leadership and sustainability in construction management research. the findings could guide organizational leaders with the responsibility of promoting sustainability practices.
rainwater_harvesting	integrated hydrological, geophysical and groundwater modeling studies has been carried out for identification of suitable sites for rainwater harvesting structures for groundwater augmentation in rrcat campus, indore, m.p. based on these studies ten check dams, two contour bunds and one earthen bund were recommended on the existing stream channels and in valley fills respectively. likely water impoundment on these structures was calculated keeping in view the length and width of stream channels. based on these study a groundwater flow model using modflow were carried out keeping in view the geologic and hydrologic conditions of the area. the net rechargeable impounded rain water from these structures to groundwater regime was calculated for monsoon seasons which varied from 20 % to 48 % and net enhancement of groundwater recharge from all structures would be around 0.11 mcm/year and the water level in the existing well would rise by 2-3 m above its present level for future groundwater augmentation.
smart_material	structural health monitoring is crucial to protect the lives and for asset management. classical sensors have low durability, low sensitivity and high cost which limit their use. development of smart cement based materials for construction industry is an important task. in this study, six different cement based mixtures were designed. five of the mixtures have 6 mm steel fiber inclusions. three samples from each mixture were cast and cured, thus, 18 samples were prepared. the samples were tested with split tensile test. simultaneous to the split tensile test, electrical potential measurements were conducted. the use of split tensile test for determining self sensing properties of cement based composites has been achieved for the first time in this study. the correlations between the electrical resistance change and tensile strain were determined. the performance measures of gage factor and linearity for a strain sensor were investigated for the cement based composites. gage factors as high as 5195 were obtained. this is the highest gage factor reported in the literature. the gage factor of cement based composite is almost 2600 times the gage factor of metal strain gages which has a gage factor of 2. the variations of electrical resistance, gage factor, linearity, correlation coefficient of best fit line to the electrical resistance change versus strain data, with respect to fiber volume fraction were discussed. the observations are encouraging further research for development of smart cement based materials which can sense its strain and damage.

water_pollution	the construction of the three gorges dam in china and the subsequent impoundment of the yangtze river have induced a major land use change in the three gorges reservoir region, which fosters increased inputs of sediment and nutrients from diffuse sources into the water bodies. several government programs have been implemented to mitigate high sediment and nutrient loads to the reservoir. however, institutional weaknesses and a focus on economic development have so far widely counteracted the effectiveness of these programs. in this study, the eco-hydrological model soil and water assessment tool is used to assess the effects of changes in fertilizer amounts and the conditions of bench terraces in the xiangxi catchment in the three gorges reservoir region on diffuse matter releases. with this, the study aims at identifying efficient management measures, which should have priority. the results show that a reduction of fertilizer amounts cannot reduce phosphorus loads considerably without inhibiting crop productivity. the condition of terraces in the catchment has a strong impact on soil erosion and phosphorus releases from agricultural areas. hence, if economically feasible, programmes focusing on the construction and maintenance of terraces in the region should be implemented. additionally, intercropping on corn fields as well as more efficient fertilization schemes for agricultural land were identified as potential instruments to reduce diffuse matter loads further. while the study was carried out in the three gorges region, its findings may also beneficial for the reduction of water pollution in other mountainous areas with strong agricultural use.
remote_sensing	hydrological models and remote sensing evapotranspiration (et) models usually are used to estimate regional et. this study aims to integrate the advantages of both the models to simulate the daily et processes. a compromise between these two methodologies is represented by improving the optimization of the hydrological model on the basis of a new probability optimal et series, which is produced by a data assimilation scheme combining sparse remote estimates and continuous modeling of regional ets. the distributed time-variant gain hydrological model (dtvgm) and a two-layer remote sensing et model are chosen. first, the dtvgm is optimized by maximizing the nash-sutcliffe efficiency of daily streamflow in the shahe river basin, and simulates the daily hydrological processes of 1999-2007. for improving the accuracy of continuous et simulation, the dtvgm is further optimized by dual objective functions composed of the assimilated ets and observed outlet discharge. the results show that the accuracy of the dtvgm-based daily ets is improved after the dual optimization, and the mean absolute percentage error between the dtvgm-based ets and the measured ets in the study area is reduced by 5.84%. the integrated method is proved better, and improves the hydrology modeling accuracy.
construction_management	the master builders south africa (mbsa) are reviewing the elements of their national h&s audit system, and the author was approached to assist with respect to the review in terms of research to identify where the focus of such an h&s audit system should be. although audits focus on the physical aspects of construction, there is concern that there is too much focus on administration. furthermore, anecdotal evidence and the findings of audits indicates that there should be more focus on risk management and hazard identification and risk assessment. 2013 and 2014 regional h&s competition award winners were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire delivered per e-mail. the salient findings include: cost, quality, and time are marginally more important than h&s to the respondents' organisations; hazard identification and risk assessment (hira), and risk management are critical; worker participation, h&s education, h&s training, construction h&s management competencies, supervision, management, and construction management competencies are important, and are all predictors of h&s performance, which manifests itself in the physical state of h&s, and 50/52 (96.2%) of aspects/interventions/stakeholders contributed to respondents' organisations achieving an h&s competition award to a major as opposed to a minor extent, and therefore a multi-content 'cocktail' is required to optimise h&s performance. emphasis should be placed on hira assessment, and risk management. auditing should focus on predictors of h&s performance such as h&s practitioners, hazard identification and risk assessment, and interventions that contribute to a 'healthy' h&s culture, and which result in a 'healthy' h&s climate such as management commitment, supervision, and worker participation.

green_building	urban green space forms an integral part of urban ecosystems. quantifying urban green space is of substantial importance for urban planning and development. considering the drawbacks of previous urban green space index models, which established either through a grid method or green distribution, and the difficulty of the validation process of earlier urban green space index models, this study exploits the advantages of multisource high-resolution remote sensing data to establish a building neighborhood green index (bngi) model. the model which analyzes the spatial configuration of built-up areas and the vegetation is based on the building-oriented method and considers four parameters - green index (gi), proximity to green, building sparsity, and building height. comparing bngi with gi in different types of characteristic building regions, it was found that bngi evaluates urban green space more sensitively. it was also found that high-rise low-sparsity area has a lower mean value of bngi (0.56) as compared with that of low-rise low-sparsity neighborhood (0.62), whereas mean gi (0.24) is equal for both neighborhoods. taking characteristics of urban building and green types into consideration, bngi model can be effectively used in many fields such as land suitability analysis and urban planning.
smart_material	piezoelectric fiber composite is an emerging smart material and exhibits much broader applications than traditional piezoelectric ceramics, especially in light-weight and curved structures. piezoelectric fiber composites with different fiber thickness and volume fraction were fabricated. the effects of structural parameters, i.e. different fiber thickness and volume fraction, on the strain properties and actuation performance of piezoelectric fiber composites were investigated at different excitation voltages at frequency of 0.1 hz. the results indicated that the free strain and tip displacement decreased with the increasing thickness of piezoelectric fiber. when 1000 v voltage was applied, the free strain and tip displacement for the composite with fiber thickness of 200 mu m were 665 mu epsilon and 1.9 mm, respectively, which were much higher than those of composite with fiber thickness of 300 mu m or 400 mu m. piezoelectric fiber composites exhibited orthotropic actuation properties, and higher free strains with larger fiber volume fraction. the longitudinal and transverse free strains of composites with 74% fiber volume fraction were 2.04 and 1.72 times magnitudes of composites with 59% fiber volume fraction, respectively. the transverse effect coefficient, the ratio between transverse and longitudinal free strains, decreased from 0.519 to 0.451 when the fiber volume fraction decreased from 74% to 59%.
remote_sensing	thermal imaging can become a readily usable tool for crop agricultural water management, since it allows a quick determination of canopy surface temperature that, as linked to transpiration, can give an idea of crop water status. in the last years, the resolution of thermal imaging systems has increased and its weight decreased, fostering their implementation on unmanned aerial vehicles (uav) for civil and agricultural engineering purposes. this approach would overcome most of the limitations of on site thermal imaging, allowing mapping plant water status at either field or farm scale, taking thus into account the naturally existing or artificially induced variability at those scales. the aim of this work was to evaluate to which extent high-resolution thermal imaging allows evaluating the instantaneous and seasonal variability of water status within a vineyard. the novelty and significance of our approach is that the specifically designed and build unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) provided very high-resolution imaging (pixel <9 cm), and that it was used at a commercially relevant acreage (7.5 ha). this set-up was used to obtain crop water stress index (cwsi) from thermal images in a clear-sky day. cwsi values were and compared to stem water potential (psi s) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) measured at 14 sampling sites across the vineyard at the moment when images where acquired. in order to evaluate the potential of cwsi acquired in a single day to estimate within-vineyard patterns of variation in water status, a spatial modeling approach was used. cwsi correlated well with ws and gs at the moment of image acquisition, showing to have a great potential to monitor instantaneous variations in water status within a vineyard. the information provided by thermal images proved to be relevant at a seasonal scale as well, although it did not match seasonal trends in water status but mimicked other physiological processes occurring during ripening. therefore, if a picture of variations in water status is required, it would be necessary to acquire thermal images at several dates along the summer.(c) 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.

suspension_bridge	a full-order and single-parameter searching method (f-s method) for analyzing coupled flutter instability of long-span bridges is proposed based on the full-discretized model of structure. based on the proper approximation of the circular frequency of complex modes, the characteristic equation of the full-order system is expressed as a complex generalized eigenvalue equation that contains only two variables. the equation is used for flutter analysis by solving the complex generalized eigenvalue problem with an efficient simultaneous iteration method directly. since its computation is reliable and efficient, the application of the proposed method on the flutter problems of long-span bridges is practical. moreover, the flutter analysis is performed for jiangyin yangtze river suspension bridge with 1385 m main span in the completed stage to illustrate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method.
water_pollution	it is well known that japan has successfully dealt with severe water pollution that was caused during its rapid economic growth. the lessons learned by japan, the technological developments that emerged and the policy measures japan devised to cope with its pollution are shared widely with asian countries that now face severe water pollution associated with economic growth. however, this information has been basically qualitative in nature. in this paper we discuss the potential of using patent data and perform analyses to substantiate the insights such data can yield in order to provide more quantitative information on historical trends in the development of essential technologies in this field. specifically, we demonstrate an approach using patent data to verify the historical development of wastewater and sewage sludge treatment technologies over the past 50 years in japan. we examined relevant patent data from 1961 onward and addressed technological development trends in relation to societal changes and the implementation of governmental policies during that period. as an example of the substantiating analysis, we applied principal component analysis and text mining to review the trends in a systematic manner. we demonstrate that the emergence of such developments can be closely associated with societal background factors such as the adoption of relevant governmental policies. we argue that this kind of patent data analysis, coupled with other essential data, can yield clues to the evolution of relevant technologies in the past, leading to useful implications for environmental management of economically developing nations.

suspension_bridge	the longitudinal stiffness of multispan suspension bridges plays an important role in load-resisting systems. in this paper, a model defined as the kinematic multispring (kms) model is proposed for simulating the longitudinal deformation behavior of multispan suspension bridges. tower springs and cable springs constitute a series-parallel system in the kms model. the stiffness formulas for cable springs were derived on the basis of the energy principle. the elastic elongation of the cable was considered and proved to be nonnegligible, especially for long-span bridges. the effect of the inclined angle of the cables was first considered in the formulas for the cable elastic stiffness. the elastic stiffness and the geometric stiffness of the cables were found to be relevant. compared with numerical models, the kms model proposed in this paper was proven to be accurate and applicable.
geotextile	the increasing air pollution of urban areas caused by particulate matter poses a problem for human health. plants are able to bind the fine dust particles on their surface and to remove them therefore from the air. therefore, roof plantings can contribute to the reduction of fine particulate matter pollution in cities. to identify roof vegetation forms with high filter ability, suitable test procedures are missing up to now. trials to identify the filtering potential of different roof top vegetation mats were conducted in a 1 m(3) big perspex chamber under controlled conditions. geotextile mats with sedum and moss vegetation were compared. uncovered geotextile mats as well as crushed stones were used as controls. in the measuring chamber, artificial particulate matter (fire-fighting powder) was applied and the concentration of particle fractions of 0.3, 0.5 and 1 a mu m over the period of 90 min measured. during 5 min in the middle of the 90 minute measuring period, wind with a speed of 2 m/s in 10 cm height was generated by means of a ventilating fan. particulate matter binding capacity of different greening mats was determined as difference between the particle concentration after application of the dust (concentration maximum) and the concentration at the end of the trial. after 90-minute dust exposition, significantly lower dust concentrations in the chamber were registered in the treatments with sedum mats compared to the controls (reductions from: 11.3 % in the fraction of 0.3 a mu m, 30.9 % in the fraction of 0.5 a mu m and 33.4 % in the fraction of 1 a mu m particles). none of the mat variations could bind the particulate matter in the fraction of 0.3 a mu m under wind speed of 2 m/s. however, the moss as well as the sedum mats reduced the particulate matter concentration of both, 0.5 and 1 a mu m fractions, under wind significantly compared to the controls. the high filter performance of sedum can be explained due to the high surface of the plants. to what extent plants can bind or uptake particulate matter under outdoor conditions permanently cannot be cleared in this experiment. however, the system allows to measure differences in binding capacity for different rooftop greening sytems.
stealth_technology	a kind of novel electromagnetic structure of cassini cross section is proposed and simulation is implemented with business microwave soft cst based on finite integral technique (fit). the electromagnetic field mode type of cassini wave-guide belongs to te, and the electromagnetic field intensity is stronger near the neck region than at other areas. for cassini electromagnetic patches and lumped elements, the radar cross section (rcs) is smaller around 7 chz with -30.85 dbsm, and the absorbing property is better around 13 ghz with 4.56 dbsm difference of rcs from comparing of pure medium. for novel radiation structure of cassini cross-section patches, the electromagnetic field value is larger in the neck areas of two half patches. at last, the potential application and development of cassini oval structure are put forward in the electromagnetic stealth technology and antennae design.
green_building	following market reforms in 1986 vietnam has transformed from a poor closed economy to a low middle income economy. like other developing countries, economic growth has placed significant pressure on both infrastructure and environment, particularly the pressure of increasing housing demand, energy consumption, and waste and pollution management. in response to the development challenges and the green movement globally, the government has initiated actions to promote green building to promote more sustainable development. however, green building adoption in vietnam is still criticised as being slow and lacking governmental support. this paper proposes that promoting green building could solve three inter-connected challenges hindering sustainable development, and provides a comparative review of progress.

ambient_intelligence	currently, museums provide their visitors with interactive tour guide applications that can be installed in mobile devices and provide timely tailor-made multimedia information about exhibits on display. in this paper, we argue that mobile devices not only could provide help to visitors, but also to museum staff. our goal is to integrate, within the same system, multimedia tour guides with the management facilities required by museums. in this paper, we present imuseuma (intelligent museum with agents), a mobile-based solution to customize visits and perform context-aware management tasks. imuseuma follows an agent-based approach, which makes it possible to interact easily with the museum environment and make decisions based on its current status. this system is currently deployed in the museum of informatics at the informatics school of the university of malaga, and its main contributions are: (i) a mobile application that provides management facilities to museum staff by means of sensing and processing environmental data; (ii) providing an integrated solution for visitors, tour guides and museum staff that allows coordination and communication enrichment among different groups of users; (iii) using and benefiting from group communication for heterogeneous groups of users that can be created on demand.
green_building	green buildings have achieved rapid development over the past two decades, yet research efforts on risk management in green building projects are still very limited. this study aims to identify and evaluate risk factors in green commercial building projects in singapore, to compare their risk criticalities with those in traditional counterparts, and to propose mitigation measures that can tackle these risk factors. to achieve these goals, a comprehensive literature review and structured interviews were carried out, and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 25 singapore-based construction companies. survey results showed that the top five critical risk factors in green commercial building projects were ""inflation,"" ""currency and interest rate volatility worsened by the import of green materials,"" ""durability of green materials,"" ""damages caused by human error,"" and ""shortage of green materials."" results also showed that green commercial building projects faced risks of design change and poor construction quality for less criticality than their traditional counterparts, but that the adoptions of green ideas, materials, and technologies had posed additional risks to green commercial building projects. additionally, seven widely used risk mitigation measures were also proposed by this study.

green_building	this study answers the following questions: do green buildings (gbs) communicate green messages to their occupants? if they do, how so? lastly, how do they influence occupants' pro-environmental behaviours? the first two questions were answered based on ideas from persuasive communication. two communication channels of a building were identified: active instruction through face-to-face interpersonal transmission and passive instruction from the building itself. previous studies investigating the influences of gbs on occupants' changing pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours were examined through the lens of the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) model. to investigate the last research question, a framework was proposed to advance current knowledge by incorporating the tpb as a theoretical foundation. furthermore, the framework helps to better understand the role of visual persuasion in gb design to fill a research gap. sample questionnaires were prepared for future adoption.
geotextile	it has been widely accepted that reinforcement made of polyethylene and polypropylene is susceptible to creep and soil 's hydraulic conductivity varies with its void ratio. however, unfortunately there is no available sensitivity analysis on time-dependent embankment behaviour taking either reinforcement viscosity or time varying hydraulic conductivity of subsoil into consideration. the influence of geosynthetic reinforcement viscosity and decreasing hydraulic conductivity with consolidation on the time-dependent performance of embankments with floating columns is investigated using a fully 3d coupled model. for an embankment at the working height corresponding to a post-consolidation polypropylene geotextile strain of about 5%, it is shown that the assumption of constant hydraulic conductivity and the failure to consider the viscous behaviour of geosynthetic reinforcement can underestimate time-dependent embankment deformations (including differential crest settlement and horizontal toe movement). the effects of factors including the foundation soil, reinforcement stiffness, column stiffness, column spacing, column type (floating and fully penetrating), and construction rate, on the time-dependent behaviour of column supported embankments are explored.

rainwater_harvesting	majority of the investigations on rainwater harvesting focused on sizing and potential water savings including studies proposing different methods of estimating rainwater tank outcomes. several studies used monthly rainfall data to estimate rainwater tank outcomes. however, quantification using daily rainfall data will be much more accurate compared to using monthly rainfall data. a vast majority of works using daily rainfall data used daily water balance model for analysis. again most of the studies using daily water balance model used historical rainfall data, calculated water savings for many years and then presented an average of all the calculated years' total outcome(s). 'raintank analyser' is a tool, which uses the same methodology and widely used; used by the south australian policy makers for producing relevant design charts. in contrast, etank, a daily water balance model was developed to produce potential rainwater savings, augmented townwater supply, tank overflow, reliability and payback period for three distinct climate conditions (dry, average and wet years). this paper presents comparison of etank calculated potential water savings with those calculated by 'raintank analyser' under similar conditions for a rainfall station in central adelaide. in general, 'raintank analyser' produced water savings are very close to the etank calculated water savings in average year. however, through the etank produced potential water savings in dry and wet years, it is found that significant climatic variations exist. magnitudes of climatic variations under different scenario are presented. again, to assess spatial variability, three more rainfall stations from different regions of adelaide metropolitan were selected. etank was used to calculated potential water savings in three climatic conditions (dry, average and wet years) for various combinations of roof and tank sizes. again it is found that depending input variable conditions (tank size, roof area and climate) significant spatial variations exist within some of the regions. also, it is found that potential water savings not only depends on total rainfall amount of a particular area, but also on other input conditions; i.e. under similar conditions an area with lower annual rainfall may provide higher water savings due to rainfall pattern.

smart_material	shape memory alloys (smas) are thermally activated and show a strong thermomechanical coupling (i.e. the relationship between strain, stress and temperature). sma wires are commonly used to develop sma-based actuators. the most important characteristics of sma wires is their capability to exert linear forces with strokes up to 8% of their original length. this make smas an attractive smart material for actuation purposes. however, the main weakness of smas is their limitation on actuation bandwidth. this limitation comes from the rate at which the sma wires are able to heat up and cool down, releasing heat energy to the surroundings. this paper focuses on the effects that different heating and cooling rates have on the sma wire 's working rate that can be attained. an sma wire has been experimentally tested under different conditions of heating, cooling and applied load to find the influence of these parameters on the contraction and cooling times of an sma wire and, therefore, on its attainable frequency. in addition, a model for smas has been implemented in a finite element analysis software and the experiments have also been simulated, which has been used to corroborate the conclusions drawn from the experiments.
water_pollution	shore zones are transition areas (ecotones) between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. their function in the environment is crucial because they serve as buffer zones that capture pollutants and slow down erosion of reservoir and watercourse banks provided that they are managed properly. research on a shore zone was conducted at the msciwojow retention reservoir with an innovative water self-purification system. after several years of its operation, an increased phosphate concentration in the main part of the reservoir was reported. the mapping of the terrain 's surface and modeling of hydrological processes in the direct catchment area of the said reservoir were done using the digital elevation model (dem). the dem was created from lidar data obtained in 2012 by airborne laser scanning. analyses of the surface runoff led to identification of surface runoff transport pathways, along which the eroded material from cultivated fields is discharged directly to the reservoir. surface runoff transport pathways gather the eroded material from a maximum area of 45,000 m(2) in the western part of the direct catchment and 40,000 m(2) in the eastern part of it. due to the reservoir management negligence, the riparian zone designed for the msciwojow reservoir no longer exists. the percentage of the natural shore that undergoes erosion processes is over 54. the said processes and fluctuations of the water level in the reservoir, as well as degradation of the shore zone caused by human activity, bring about limited plant development in the littoral zone, which in turn lowers the reservoir 's resistance to degradation.
solar_energy	a significant proportion of the solar irradiance that reaches the earth 's surface is normally attenuated by atmospheric properties and overcast conditions related to the rainy season. the solar analyst (sa) model, irradiance and long term precipitation data were used to assess this relationship in guadalajara, mexico. a spatial analysis based on morphological and statistical criteria increased the model 's certainty. the sa model explains 95.4% of the irradiation variability observed on the ground, with average uncertainties of 3.7% during clear sky conditions in the dry season and 4.4% on sunny days in the wet season. the meteorological data analysis shows that total precipitation in 2014 had an atypical temporal distribution and was slightly lower (12.6%) than the average from 1991 to 2012. a deficit of 39% in precipitation compared to the long term average was found in the first half of the season, which was later partially compensated. this deficit was interpreted as a temporary delay in high values of precipitation. based on the potential average irradiation from the sa model and field observations, it can be concluded that overcast conditions related to rainfall through 2014 attenuated approximately 28.5% of the incoming solar energy. taking the global energy balance into account, this fraction was higher in comparison to the energy proportion reflected by the cloud 's albedo (ca 23%). these results suggest that both the high proportion of energy attenuated and atypical weather conditions may be local effects of large-scale phenomena such as the el nino-southern oscillation.
ambient_intelligence	developing a large, but smart environment is a complex task that requires the collaboration of experts of different disciplines. how to successfully attain such collaboration is not a trivial matter. the paper illustrates the problem with a case study where the manager of the facility intends to influence pedestrians so that they choose a task that requires certain effort, e.g. using staircases, instead of the current one that requires less effort, e.g. using the elevator. defining requirements for such scenarios requires a strong multidisciplinary collaboration which is not currently well supported. this paper contributes with an approach to provide non-technician experts with tools so that they can provide feedback on the requirements and verify them in a systematic way.
smart_material	this chapter describes polymers that undergo a temperature-induced phase transition in aqueous solution providing an important basis for smart materials. different types of temperature-responsive polymers, including shape-memory materials, liquid crystalline materials and responsive polymer solutions are briefly introduced. subsequently this chapter will focus on thermoresponsive polymer solutions. at first, the basic principles of the upper and lower critical temperature polymer phase transitions will be discussed, followed by an overview and discussion of important aspects of various key types of such temperature-responsive polymers. finally, selected potential applications of thermoresponsive polymer solutions will be described.
suspension_bridge	global navigation satellite system (gnss) positioning technology has been employed in the dynamic monitoring of long-span bridges in the recent years. however, it has difficulties to meet the higher accuracy requirements of the dynamic monitoring of small or medium span bridges, due to the presence of measurement noise from multipath, cycle slips, ionosphere delay, orbital errors, etc. to verify the feasibility of using current gnss technology to monitor these bridges, a series of monitoring experiments have been carried out on the wilford suspension bridge in nottingham (uk) with gnss and a triaxial accelerometer. three gnss data processing modes, i.e. real-time kinematic (rtk), network rtk and post-processing kinematic (ppk), were considered. an innovative multimode adaptive filtering (maf) that combining adaptive filter with chebyshev highpass filter was used to identify the dynamic displacements of the bridge from the multimode gnss data. to validate the gnss results, the dynamic displacements were also computed from double integration of the accelerometer-measured accelerations. the differences of the displacements between the gnss and accelerometer results were obtained. the standard deviation and the mean deviation of these differences are less than 1 mm, which is good enough for the monitoring purposes. the modal frequencies of the bridge can be accurately identified from gnss measurements, and successfully validated by those from the accelerometer data. using the multimode gnss data and the proposed the map algorithm, with sub-millimeter level accuracy gnss can be used to monitor the vibration response of small or medium span bridges as well as long-span bridges.

water_pollution	the frequent, widespread use of pesticides in agriculture adversely affects biodiversity, human health, and water quality. in 2008, the french government adopted an environmental policy plan, ""ecophyto 2018"", to halve pesticide use within 10 years. trends in synthetic pesticide sales and use in france were described, through three different indicators: the number of unit doses (nud), the quantity of active ingredient (qai), and the treatment frequency index (tfi). changes in pesticide use on seven of the principal arable crops in france since the implementation of this policy plan were analyzed, together with the impact of changes in pesticide use on water quality. no evidence was found for a decrease in pesticide sales at national level between 2008 and 2013. in terms of the tfi values for individual crops, the only decrease in pesticide use observed since 2001 was for soft wheat. this decrease was very slight, and pesticide use did not decline more rapidly after 2006 than before. changes in pesticide use differed between french regions and crops. water pollution did not decrease during the period studied. possible explanations for the lack of effectiveness of the french environmental plan are considered in the context of european legislation.

water_pollution	water quality early warning system is mainly used to detect deliberate or accidental water pollution events in water distribution systems. identifying the types of pollutants is necessary after detecting the presence of pollutants to provide warning information about pollutant characteristics and emergency solutions. thus, a real-time contaminant classification methodology, which uses the multi-classification support vector machine (svm), is proposed in this study to obtain the probability for contaminants belonging to a category. the svm-based model selected samples with indistinct feature, which were mostly low-concentration samples as the support vectors, thereby reducing the influence of the concentration of contaminants in the building process of a pattern library. the new sample points were classified into corresponding regions after constructing the classification boundaries with the support vector. experimental results show that the multi-classification svm-based approach is less affected by the concentration of contaminants when establishing a pattern library compared with the cosine distance classification method. moreover, the proposed approach avoids making a single decision when classification features are unclear in the initial phase of injecting contaminants.
geotextile	some biomolecules are well known for the complexation of heavy metals from wastewater: cellulose, alginate, pectins, and starches for example. however, less used natural molecules could also be efficient to chelate heavy metals. indeed, some cells contain polypeptides that can help detoxifying living organisms containing heavy metals. this natural detoxification process is of great interest, and particularly the molecules taking part in it. the amino acids composing these polypeptides, especially cysteine, tyrosine, and histidine, can be used for water purification. the efficiency of biomolecules containing aromatic rings on heavy metals complexation is also investigated. all these biomolecules are able to chelate heavy metals thanks to some chemical groups and atoms: the most well-known and efficient chemical groups are listed in the article. finally, some potential environmental applications of biomolecules are suggested at the end of the article.
remote_sensing	drastic urbanization has taken place in china during the last two decades. recently, a considerable number of ""ghost cities"" have emerged due to the extensive and unreasonable urban expansion which far exceeds the practical demand. in order to investigate ""ghost cities"", we proposed a feasible framework by utilizing multi-source remote sensing datasets, including nighttime light imagery, land cover type products and population grid. after eliminating blooming effect of nighttime imagery by a proposed modified optimal threshold method (motm) and extracting built-up area from land cover type products, we developed a ""ghost city"" index (gci) to quantify and evaluate the intensity of ""ghost city"" phenomenon in yangtze river delta at county/district level. the gci was established according to the intrinsic features of ""ghost cities"", comprising three criteria: consistency of lit area and built-up area, illumination intensity and population density. then, we explored the spatial pattern of ""ghost cities"" of different gci categories and the ternary contour was applied to demonstrate the key factor among three criteria. our finding implies that ""ghost cities"" are prominently spatial clustered. meanwhile, counties and new development zones have higher risk of suffering from the phenomenon, while capital cities and municipal cities have an alleviative effect for ambient regions. besides, regions with higher intensity of the phenomenon tend to have less balanced composition among three criteria. our results show good consistency with previous reports and studies, providing a more objective and spatial explicit insight into the ""ghost city"" phenomenon. our findings do not only prove the capability of monitoring ""ghost cities"" using remote sensing data, but would also be beneficial to urban planning and regional sustainable development.(c) 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
green_building	taking the rural green building assessment system of the northwest china as the research object, the paper would discuss regional adaptability of the green building assessment system. the paper puts forward the assessment target facing the dilemma with the development of the desertification of rural buildings in northwest china. it presents seven assessment items such as the energy, land resources, water resources, material resources, living quality, environmental load and social effect through the methods of expert consultation, survey and technology information analysis and so on. on the above basis, assessment index system of desertification of rural green buildings in northwest china would be put forward.
geotextile	numerical modelers are often faced with the challenge to numerically reproduce the physical behavior of soil-geosynthetic interaction problems using assumed values for missing soil and interface model parameters. this paper examines two such examples using the finite-difference method, (1) horizontal pullout of a geosynthetic (geogrid) reinforcement layer in a pullout box and (2) a geosynthetic (geotextile)-reinforced soil layer over a void. it also presents the results of parametric sensitivity analyses for the missing soil and interface model parameter values and identifies the values that give the best agreement with measured data. the paper further demonstrates that correct modeling of geometrical nonlinearity is key to accurately predicting the performance of geosynthetic-reinforced soil systems controlled by the tensioned membrane effect. the lessons learned in this study will be of interest to numerical modelers during numerical model design of geosynthetic-reinforced soil systems.
smart_material	liquid quantum dots (qds) have been used as a fluorescent films sensor. constructing a macroscopic, responsive, liquid qd system for lysine (lys) is a challenging task. to achieve a selective macroscopic response towards lys, herein we present a new strategy for integrating host-guest chemistry into a liquid qd system. water-soluble pillar[ 5] arene wp5 was designed and synthesized as a host. wp5 was introduced onto the surface of peg1810-modified qds by host-guest interactions to obtain liquid wp5-1810-qds. the interaction between wp5 and lys is stronger than that between wp5 and peg-1810, causing wp5 to be released from the 1810-qds surface in the presence of lys, resulting in macroscopic fluorescence quenching. this smart material shows promise in amino acid sensing and separation.
remote_sensing	having one of the most vulnerable coasts of the world to climate change, bangladesh and india are facing new challenges to protect sundarban, the largest mangrove in the world, from adverse impacts of climate-driven changes. in this study, unsupervised classification of mangrove density is performed on landsat images of folk time periods over 35 years (1975-77, 1989, 2000 and 2010) to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the sundarban mangrove, and infer the causes of observed changes. specifically the influences of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on these changes are discriminated by correlating the observed change patterns with cyclones' tracks, erosion processes and areas of expected human influences as assessed by local stakeholders. results highlight a very dynamic systerh, with rapid changes characterized by decreasing mangrove density, mainly in india, erosion and accretion. there is similar to 1.2% (or 11,500 ha) net erosion in 35 years in sundarban, which remains limited relative to the documented high rate of sea level rise of 6 mm/yr. mangrove density changes are attributed to cyclones, increased salinity and anthropogenic influences. based on interpretation of the spatial pattern of density changes by local stakeholders, we conclude that the zones accessible to human activities are significantly more affected by land cover changes. management policies of sundarban by bangladeshi and indian authorities should acknowledge the important role played by natural or global drivers like sea level change, cyclones in affecting the mangrove as well as manage the localized anthropogenic pressures.

remote_sensing	despite renewed efforts to better understand glacier change and recognize glacier change trends in the andes, relatively large areas in the andes of argentina and chile are still not investigated. in this study, we report on glacier elevation and mass changes in the outer region of the northern and southern patagonian icefields in the southern patagonian andes. a newly-compiled landsat etm+ derived glacier inventory (consisting of 2253 glaciers and similar to 1314 +/- 66 km(2) of ice area) and differencing of the srtm and spot5 dems were used to derive glacier-specific elevation changes over the 2000-12 period. the investigated glaciers showed a volume change of -0.71 +/- 0.55 km(3) a(-1), yielding a surface lowering of 0.52 +/- 0.35 m a(-1) on average and an overall mass loss of 0.46 +/- 0.37 m w.e. a(-1). highly variable individual glacier responses were observed and interestingly, they were less negative than previously reported for the neighboring patagonian icefields.
solar_energy	a hybrid photoelectrochemical and microbial fuel cell (hpmfc) is constructed for simultaneous utilization of solar energy and bioenergy by installing a tio2 photoanode next to a bioanode that shares the same cathode in a microbial fuel cell (mfc). connecting the photoelectrochemical (pec) circuit results in enhanced cathode potentials for the mfc based on the differences in power output characteristics of mfc and pec alone. the improved power production of the mfc is accompanied by a relatively small decline in the power density of the pec, yielding an overall enhancement in power output for the hpmfc.
stealth_technology	closed plasma can overcome difficulties of maintaining plasma and excessive energy consumption in open environment. for plasma stealth technology, a closed plasma generator was designed. using microsecond pulse generator and argon as working gas, discharge experiments were carried out under low pressure environment. the emission spectrum of ar at different position in discharge chamber was measured. by using collisional-radiative modal(crm), the distribution of plasma parameters was studied. at a given electron temperature and density with specified discharge parameters, corresponding population distribution could be obtained by crm. by comparing the line ratio of argon 2p levels acquired from crm with the line ratio from spectrum measured, the plasma parameters were confirmed after obtaining the minimum difference value. using the line ratio of argon 2p9 to 2p1 from crm while the range of electron density was 1 similar to 5 ev, the calculating error was analyzed. the results reveal that, the electron density of the closed plasma reaches a magnitude of 10(11) cm(-3) and shows a gradient distribution with small variational amplitude, and the distribution is beneficial to the application of plasma stealth.
suspension_bridge	a rectangular plate modeling the roadway of a suspension bridge is considered. both the contributions of the bending and stretching energies are analyzed. the latter plays an important role due to the presence of the free edges. a linear model is first considered; in this case, separation of variables is used to determine explicitly the deformation of the plate in terms of the vertical load. moreover, the same method allows us to study the spectrum of the linear operator and the least eigenvalue. then the stretching energy is introduced without linearization and the equation becomes quasilinear; the nonlinear term also affects the boundary conditions. we consider two quasilinear models; the surface increment model (sim) in which the stretching energy is proportional to the increment of the surface and a nonlocal model (nlm) introduced by berger in the 50s (see berger (1955)). the sim and the nlm are studied in detail. according to the strength of prestressing we prove the existence of multiple equilibrium positions.

ambient_intelligence	nowadays many organizations experience security incidents due to unauthorized access to information. to reduce the risk of such incidents, security policies are often employed to regulate access to information. such policies, however, are often too restrictive, and users do not have the rights necessary to perform assigned duties. as a consequence, access control mechanisms are perceived by users as a barrier and thus bypassed, making the system insecure. in this paper, we draw a bridge between the social concept of conviviality and access control. conviviality has been introduced as a social science concept for ambient intelligence and multi-agent systems to highlight soft qualitative requirements like user-friendliness of systems. to bridge the gap between conviviality and security, we propose a methodological framework for updating and adapting access control policies based on conviviality recommendations. our methodology integrates and extends existing techniques to assist system designers in the derivation of access control policies from socio-technical requirements of the system, while taking into account the conviviality of the system. we illustrate our framework using the ambient assisted living use case from the hotcity of luxembourg.
suspension_bridge	during the operation stage, parallel bridges may become nonparallel as a result of unequal load distribution between two parallel bridges and other special conditions. aerodynamic performance could change significantly under nonparallel positions and become different from that under parallel positions. in this paper, the stationary aerodynamic performance of two parallel bridges under various nonparallel positions during operation stage is studied through a series of wind tunnel tests. this includes the investigation of two horizontal gap distances (hgds), five relative vertical displacements (rvd) and five relative torsional displacements (rtd). first, sectional models of two closed box girders were tested in smooth flow for stationary aerodynamic force coefficients. an optimum iteration method was then used to calculate the structural displacements and torsional divergence critical wind velocities (u-cr) of two assumed suspension bridges under stationary aerodynamic force. the research outcomes demonstrated that the changes of stationary aerodynamic force coefficients are dependent on the relative displacements of two girders and wind attack angles. in addition, it was revealed that interference effects are detrimental to stationary aerodynamic instability of two bridges with a larger gap-width ratio (i.e. d/b = 1), which is related to the aerodynamic shape of girders and bridge structures. further, the ucr of the leeward bridge significantly decline when the vertical position of the leeward bridge become higher that of the windward bridge. most importantly, it showed that the combination of rvd and rtd (e.g. rvd = -20mm and rtd = -2 degrees) could potentially lead to the worst stationary aerodynamic performance by decreasing u-cr of the windward and leeward bridge with 12.03% and 7.89%, respectively.
solar_energy	one important goal for any developing country is to establish and provide electric power for its citizens; an endeavor initiated by the government of bangladesh many years ago. renewable energy is a key component for development and bangladesh has already made significant strides in reaching most of the country 's population; both in urban and rural areas. the renewable energy projects initiated by the government are helping private sector, non-governtnent organizations (ngos), and micro-finance institutions expand the solar energy program, both in terms of sustainability and commercial-viability. these projects are increasing awareness among consumers and suppliers of the benefits and the correct use of solar home systems. the study, therefore, investigates whether solar business industry should implement a common strategy to position itself in all over the country. the authors outline the benefits of using solar energy and the possibilities regarding solar energy system in bangladesh as well as the problems relating to this sector. data was collected via questionnaire on a systematic random basis. the results indicate significant business potentials of the solar energy sector. as perception towards renewable energy product is being measured in terms of convenience, country made perception and as a whole it will enhance the comfort of the society to some extent but also it will contribute in the economy if proper sales and service is given to the consumers. the authors recommend the initiation of motivational awareness by policy developers of bangladesh, for the achievement of sustainable growth in the production of renewable energy.
rainwater_harvesting	a high-altitude (>1,500 m asl) integrated participatory watershed development programme was implemented between 2004 and 2008 in the west khasi hills, meghalaya, north-eastern indian himalaya. the aim was to assess and refine practices for integrating crop, fish and livestock production systems. soil and water conservation measures, with the active participation of local inhabitants, included the construction and renovation of ponds, jalkunds (micro rainwater-harvesting structures) and bench and half-moon terraces. impact analysis revealed that 4.3 million litres of water were harvested and enhanced potato and rice crop productivity by 30% to 40% and 45% to 50% respectively. farmers are now able to earn net incomes of around $56.8 and $8.9 per month from community dairy units and fish ponds respectively.
solar_energy	the amount and quality of the energy converted by a photovoltaic system connected to the grid can be evaluated by experimental monitoring or computer simulation. the solar energy laboratory at ufrgs developed a simulation software for analysis of grid connected photovoltaic systems (fvconect). in order to perform a reliable simulation, it is required for the implementation of suitable mathematical models that describe the behavior of each system component. the inverter is the equipment responsible for converting dc to ac. the manufacturers provide some technical parameters for the inverters. however, electrical and thermal characteristics require mathematical models which coefficients must be obtained from specific tests. this work presents a methodology for analysis of thermal behavior of inverters. such analysis requires experimental determination of two thermal coefficients. energy losses due to inverters overheating can be calculated through the proposed methodology, providing a more accurate simulation of a determined photovoltaic (pv) system. the proposed methodology has been tested in several inverters, providing good results.
water_pollution	for the purpose of analyzing and managing urban water pollution discharge systems (uwpds) comprehensively, a systematic approach of tracking and tracing analyses was developed based on environmental systems analysis theory, in which the directed graph, the nodal flow balance and the network analysis of geographic information system (gis) were used. based on the digitalized uwpds of gis which was established by collecting and processing a large amount of topographic, sewage discharge and drainage data, this scientific approach can be applied to make the tracking and tracing analyses on wastewater treatment plants, pumping stations, illicit sewage outlets, pollution sources and drainage pipelines systematically. the upstream and downstream information about sources, discharging paths, flow quantities and final destinations of pollutants was obtained, and potential problems in the uwpds analysis such as illicit connections between different drainage pipelines were identified, with the spatial analysis. this developed approach was tested using the uwpds of chaohu city (anhui province, china). the study results are important for the implementation of sewage interception engineering, the determination of load reduction, and the optimization of drainage pipelines and pumping stations in future.

construction_management	extracting critical sections from project management documents is a challenging process and an active area of research. project management documents contain certain earlywarnings that, if modelled properly, may inform the project planners and managers in advance of any impending risks via early warnings. extraction of such indicators from documents is termed as text mining, which is an active area of research. in the context of construction project management, extraction of semantically crucial information from documents is a challenging task that can in turn be used to provide decision support by optimising the entire project lifecycle. this research presents a two-step modelling and clustering methodology. it exploits the capability of a nalve bayes classifier to extract early warnings from management text data. in the first step, a database corpus is prepared via a qualitative analysis of expertly fed questionnaire responses. in the latter stage a naive bayes classifier is proposed which evaluates real-world construction management documents to identify potential risks based on certain keyword usages. the classifier outcome was compared against labelled test documents and gave an accuracy of 68.02%, which is better than the majority of text mining algorithms reported in the literature.

geotextile	the geotextile tubes are widely used as reef structures, with their crest below the mean sea level. the requirement of the beach width is the main criterion to decide crest level of the nearshore reef structure. for greater depth placement, stacked tubes may be one of the alternative solutions. in certain circumstances, the geotextile tubes are also used right at the eroding coastline. it is well known that tubes placed abutting to the eroding coastline get damaged at an early age. this has been experienced at devbag in maharashtra, candolim in goa and shankarpur coast in west bengal. however, geotextile tubes placed at the eroding coast & covered with sand or rubble protection; enhance the life of the structure. in case of beach nourishment project, the unsegmented row of tubes placed below msl is useful for many purposes. it acts as an offshore reef & helps in attenuating the wave energy directly attacking the coastline, it traps the sediments during the downrush and also acts as a barrier to hold the nourished sand. recurring periodic expenditure of the beach nourishment also decreases after the beach stabilization within 2-3 years. experiences with geotextile tubes for coastal protection works in india are described in the paper. pros and cons of the geotextile tubes placement, crest level decision, significance of the protection of fabric from uv rays etc. are discussed in details with a few case studies.
construction_management	the planning of jobsite layouts and logistics management has a major impact on the performance of tunnel construction projects that use tunnel-boring machines (tbms). frequently, projects do not reach the highest possible production performance due to undersized logistics processes or insufficient storage capacities. in this paper, a flexible simulation framework for analyzing interactions between production and logistics processes on tunneling jobsites is presented. a formal ontology for logistic elements on a tunneling jobsite is developed using sysml formalism. based on this formulation, single systems elements combined in process chains are analyzed and their influence on production processes is evaluated. the formal system description identifies process dependencies and resource constraints of the system elements. these formulations are implemented in configurable simulation components for construction equipment, storage spaces, and production materials. using these components, a jobsite simulation model can be created. the jobsite layout is represented at a high level of detail, with geometric shapes used for estimating storage capacities and movement durations. this approach uses discrete event and system dynamic simulation and applies probability functions to inputs representing production process times. dynamic simulation can reveal unknown impacts of logistical processes on the continuous advance processes of the tbm. a simulation model for tbms is integrated to determine the demand for supply processes. a fast and effective comparison between different jobsite layouts and logistics strategies is possible due to flexible components. by analyzing the workload of construction equipment, robust and efficient setups can be developed. a case study illustrates the usefulness of the simulation framework by comparing the performance of three different jobsite setups for a tunneling project.

green_building	to promote energy-efficient operations in residential and office buildings, non-intrusive load monitoring (nilm) techniques have been proposed to infer the fine-grained power consumption and usage patterns of appliances from power-line measurement data. fine-grained monitoring of everyday appliances (such as toasters and coffee makers) can not only promote energy-efficient building operations, but also provide unique insights into the context and activities of individuals. current building-level nilm techniques are unable to identify the consumption characteristics of relatively low-load appliances, whereas smart-plug based solutions incur significant deployment and maintenance costs. in this paper, we investigate an intermediate architecture, where smart circuit breakers provide measurements of aggregate power consumption at room (or section) level granularity. we then investigate techniques to identify the usage and energy consumption of individual appliances from such measurements. we first develop a novel correlation-based approach called cbpa to identify individual appliances based on both their unique transient and steady-state power signatures. while promising, cbpa fails when the set of candidate appliances is too large. to further improve the accuracy of appliance level usage estimation, we then propose a hybrid system called aarpa, which uses mobile sensing to first infer high-level activities of daily living (adls), and then uses knowledge of such adls to effectively reduce the set of candidate appliances that potentially contribute to the aggregate readings at any point. we evaluate two variants of this algorithm, and show, using real-life data traces gathered from 10 domestic users, that our fusion of mobile and power-line sensing is very promising: it identified all devices that were used in each data trace, and it identified the usage duration and energy consumption of low-load consumer appliances with similar to 87% accuracy.
stealth_technology	this paper handles a proposed anti-stealth technique for countering radar absorbent material stealth technology through enhancing material electric permittivity. em3500 wave absorber was used for the experimental work which its optical properties exhibit stealth characteristics with absorption coefficient 3.61566 and reflection coefficient 0.041 at wavelength 300 nm and frequency 1 mhz the enhancing of electric permittivity and decreasing loss tangent was performed by using non-lethal nd yag 532nm. impedance analyzer agilent test results shows increasing the em3500 electric permittivity with percentage 11.5% at frequency band 1mhz and 5.5% at 3ghz also decreasing it 's loss tangent with 27.7% at 1mhz and 7.5 % at 3ghz. the research problem is implementing anti stealth technique in invisible dynamic environment as the structure of offensive target is uncertain. so there are considerations for making unmanned aerial vehicle defensive by covering its surface with certain number of laser beam firing angle according to its dimensions. these laser beams create symmetric geometries transverse to aircraft which is the expected dimensions of offensive stealth target. the accuracy of the system is determined through the mathematical modeling of laser beam firing angle. model predictive control and fuzzy logic control were used for controlling laser beam firing angle for covering the unmanned aerial vehicle surface and achieving intelligent geometry for the uncertain target structure. if the target 's permittivity increased the electromagnetic waves can detect the target then destroying it by using pulsed laser beam, this monograph is future research for enhancing anti stealth implementation.

rainwater_harvesting	the water resources management may face serious challenges under climate change. in order to efficiently utilize water resources and reduce loadings on centralized water supply systems, it is necessary for each water user to reduce their water requirements. rural community consumes the great portion of water resources in taiwan due to high irrigation water demands and thus is concerned in this study. the rural community considers having both external domestic water supply and irrigation systems, and installing reuse system and constructed wetland to provide harvested rainwater and reclaimed water. the purpose of this study is to establish an integrated water resources system dynamics model and propose indicators for quantitatively evaluating the water supply system of a rural community. the three indicators are designed to evaluate water saving efficiency, tolerance of drought duration, and influence of insufficient irrigation water on crop yields. the results show that the combination of the constructed wetland and reuse system possesses more eminent stability than the reuse system alone. the integrated water resources system may reduce up to 32 % of domestic water demands and 7.8 % of irrigation water demands from external systems, respectively. at the same time, the domestic system owns higher resilience. in conclusion, the results indicate that the reuse system and constructed wetland can significantly improve the stability and resilience of water supply system. the study on integrated water resources system for rural community desires more researches. besides, the influence of climate change and water quality of reclaimed water should be further considered.
solar_energy	the ionic liquids (ils) as heat transfer fluids (htfs) are limited for lack of strong ability in absorption of sunlight. hence, nanoparticles are added in pure ils to improve their thermal and optical properties. in this study, a highly stable ionic liquid nanofluid (ionanofiuid) was first prepared by dispersing sic nanoparticles in [hmim]bf4 and their thermophysical and optical properties were thoroughly investigated as htfs application in direct absorption solar collectors (dacs). an enhancement in thermal properties in ionanofluids was observed. 0.06 wt% sic ionanofluids could increase the tc and specific heat of pure [hmim]bf4 about 10.2% and 5% at 25 degrees c, respectively. with the increase of temperature, the thermal properties increase, while the viscosity and density decreased. it was indicated that sic ionanofluids were more suitable in medium-high temperature application. additionally the results of optical properties showed that sic ionanofluids were a superior solar absorption material, where the extinction coefficient of 0.03 wt% sic ionanofluids could increase about 5.8 cm(-1). in summary, the advantageous performance ensured the potential of sic ionanofluids as advanced htfs in solar energy system. we believed that this information have guide meaning to the practical design of dac system.
green_building	this paper explores the interest by policy makers to encourage and develop a green economy, with a particular focus on uk government attempts to engender a shift in the mainstream building and construction sector towards adopting green building methods and techniques. the building sector has been the focus of endeavours to engender a shift towards greener ways of working and building, due to its high contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and associated concerns over enhanced global warming and climate change. the paper outlines the recent development of national uk policy on green building as exemplified in legislation for the code for sustainable homes and in building regulations. these have given rise to a particular set of responses to green building requirements that favour technological solutions that can readily be accommodated by the existing system. in critiquing these developments we draw upon socio-technical sustainability transitions research, one strand of which has focused on the ways in which niche developments can challenge and disrupt existing regimes of practice. we do this empirically through our research into the green building sector which has involved in-depth interviews with a range of actors from the uk green building sector, including architects, building companies, materials suppliers and policy makers. respondents from within the green building niche are critical of current uk legislation, and argue that its narrow conceptualisation fails to adequately encourage, or recognise, what they would consider to be green building forms that will contribute to substantial reductions in carbon emissions, nor does it respect locally appropriate building methods.

ambient_intelligence	in this paper, we present a complete overview of ambient intelligence (ami) focused in its applications, considering the involved domain and technologies. the applications include ami at home, care of elderly and people with disabilities, healthcare, education, business, public services, leisure and entertainment. the aim of this survey of ami 's applications is to show its socials and ethical implications and specially privacy issues. intelligent environments (ie) collect and process a massive amount of person-related and sensitive data. these data must ensure privacy of the users. an important concern in ami 's applications is privacy. addressing design by privacy, an important challenge to consider is the development of an architecture that includes the different privacy policies and how can we fusion them in a specific application domain. ensuring privacy in intelligent environments is a difficult problem to solve, as there are different perceptions of privacy and its role in computing for each user. in the so called 'design by privacy' we have to identify the relevant design issues that should be addressed for its developing. here we present an approach to the dimensions to consider, in order to provide privacy in the design of ambient intelligence 's applications.
rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting systems (rhs) are increasingly used in buildings to mitigate water shortage and rising prices of centralised water supply. notwithstanding the benefits of rhs, they may also promote adverse impacts mainly related to the high consumption of energy. in this context, energy intensity (i.e. unit of energy per unit of water) is a crucial parameter for assessing the environmental feasibility of different rhs. however, only recently has attention been drawn to the connection between water and energy consumption, which has been prompted by the increasing importance of water security, energy efficiency and economic feasibility. this connection, known as the water-energy nexus, has been increasingly acknowledged as a key principal for water planning. the objective of this study is twofold: (i) to review the energy intensity data reported for rhs; and (ii) to outline strategies to enhance the energy performance of rhs in buildings. for the reviewed literature, the median energy intensity of theoretical studies (0.20 kwh/m(3)) was considerably lower than that described in empirical studies (1.40 kwh/m(3)). this implies that theoretical assessments of energy intensity may not sufficiently consider the energy used for pump start-ups and standby mode, as well as the true motor and pump energy efficiency. however, to some extent, this difference may also represent the amount of energy that can be reduced by optimising rhs design and operation. when comparing rhs to conventional town water supply systems, the reviewed empirical studies showed that rhs tend to be three times more energy intensive, although optimised rhs can have more comparable values. ultimately, it is predominately the local characteristics, such as rainwater demand, building type (single-storey or multi-storey), rhs sub-systems design, potable water plumbing system design, and town water energy intensity, among other factors that will determine whether or not the environmental and economic performances of rhs are acceptable.

ambient_intelligence	it is a common goal to improve safety and performance of mobile indoor robots by predicting the movements of people in the surroundings. in contrast to many related works which exclusively employ sensors mounted on mobile robots, this work shows a method to achieve this goal in a smart environment where external sensors are used to sense people 's positions. by using probabilistic models and filters, the evolution of the environment 's state is predicted and optimal paths with respect to safety and performance are planned. experiments in reality and in a simulation environment show the applicability in real-world scenarios and the advantages over classical path planning approaches.
geotextile	three different multicomponent geosynthetic clay liners (gcls) from different manufacturers are tested in a transmissivity cell with a new testing procedure to quantify the flow rate and the interface transmissivity between the coating or attached film presenting a hole and the upper geotextile of the gcl. the testing device was previously used in studies aiming to evaluate the interface transmissivity between a damaged geomembrane (gm) and a regular gcl. different results are obtained regarding the evolution with the time of the flow rate ranging from 1.73 x 10(-11) m(3)/s to 2.18 x 10(-10) m(3)/s at steady state, which is on average in the range of flow rate results obtained with a gm-gcl composite liner. additional tests performed by adding a gm on top give lower values of flow rates. this shows the importance of the film or coating rigidity for decreasing flow rate and insuring a better quality contact at the interface.
suspension_bridge	this paper presents a new experimental setup for the aerodynamic section model testing of bridge decks. the rig is designed to move a section model in arbitrary motion in a wind tunnel to imitate the motions of such scaled real bridge motion, step motion or random motion histories to be close to white noise. the proposed setup enables the forces acting on the section model to be measured directly while considering motions that resemble actual bridge motion and still fully utilizing the benefits of the forced vibration testing technique. the excellent performance of the system and testing procedure is proved by performing state-of-the-art forced vibration tests to extract 18 flutter derivatives of the hardanger bridge cross-section. the new experimental setup is further used to simulate a three-degree-of-freedom dynamic system driven by white noise to investigate whether the estimates of the aerodynamic derivatives are sensitive to the motion considered. the experimental results demonstrate that the estimates of the aerodynamic derivatives are not sensitive to the motion considered; these results indicate that the principle of superposition is fully applicable for the cross section as long as the motions are within the range considered.
solar_energy	underground spaces normally are at cooler air temperature than ambient air temperature because of earth-sheltered walls. this cooler air can be circulated to occupied spaces using a solar chimney effect to exhaust air from the basement to where it is needed. this work aims to study the viability of using natural ventilation induced by a trombe wall to draw fresh air from underground basement floors for space cooling in the dry desert climate. outdoor air is delivered to the basement through an earth tube. a numerical model integrating thermal models of the basement space and the occupied zone, and the trombe wall is used to predict the air temperature variation with time in the occupied space air temperature and to predict thermal comfort. the feasibility of implementing the proposed system is assessed in a case study of a residence in the inland dry desert climate of lebanon during the summer. it was found that the proposed system achieved thermally comfortable conditions at 80% acceptability for a considerable number of hours without the need for mechanical ventilation (83.3% in june and 58.3% in august). the electric energy consumption of the system over summer (june through september) was estimated at 7.71kw h/m(2) of floor area.

rainwater_harvesting	this study was conducted to evaluate the quality of stored rainwater in basic schools in the tamale metropolis, a semi-arid region of ghana, which experiences persistent water scarcity. sixty four stored rainwater samples were collected from eight rainwater harvesting facilities in eight basic schools in november and december, 2013, and analysed. total coliform levels ranged from 1.1 x 10(1) to 1.2 x 10(3) cfu/100 ml with a mean of 208 +/- 195 cfu/100 ml. the microbial load exceeded world health organisation 's (who) limit for potability. heavy metal concentrations were within who standards except cadmium and lead. drinking of stored rainwater can be deleterious to the health of pupils in the basic schools studied. it is therefore recommended that potable water should be provided in the basic schools in order to meet the millennium development goals.
smart_material	ionic polymer metal composite (ipmc) is a kind of ionic electroactive polymer (eap) smart material that can exhibit conspicuous deflection with low external voltages (similar to 5 v). it can be cut in various sizes and shapes, and used and applied in robots and artificial muscles with the capability in aquatic operation. an ipmc strip can be modeled as a cantilever beam with a loading distribution on the surface. nevertheless, the loading distribution is non-uniform due to the imperfect surface conductivity that causes four different imaginary loading distributions employed in our structural model. the difference can be up to 5 times (3:8 mm to 19 mm). in this paper, a novel linear time-variant (ltv) model is introduced and applied to model an ipmc system. this modeling method is different from previous linear time-invariant (lti) models because the internal environment of ipmc may be unsteady due to mobile cations with water molecules. in addition, the influence of surface conductivity is simulated and proven based on this model. finally, by applying this novel modeling method, hysteresis that exists in ipmc and affects the relationship between the output deflection and the corresponding input voltage, such as 0:1-, 0:2-, and 0:3-rad/s sinusoidal waves, has been shown and simulated.
suspension_bridge	in this study on a long-span suspension bridge, the wind and vibration data collected by a long-term monitoring system from the year 2010 to 2014 are used for cluster analysis. an automatic and fast clustering algorithm is employed to recognize the vortex-induced vibrations (vivs) on the bridge deck in long-term monitoring datasets. the acceleration amplitude (root mean square) and frequency ratio are selected as indicators for the clustering of the vivs from other vibrations. cluster analysis is further conducted on the wind speed field of viv samples, arid the results indicate that the nonuniformity of the wind speed along the span-wise direction has a significant influence on the viv mode. the relationship between the wind speed field and viv mode is obtained by the clustering with consideration of nonuniformity of the wind speed.

green_building	low-income housing (lih) projects have a vital role in developing countries as they serve a large sector of society; hence, they are considered one of the most important projects funded by governments. the total life-cycle cost (lcc) of these projects is incurred during the use phase, making these projects lose its economic aspect of sustainability. therefore, it is important to decrease the costs of such projects during their life cycle, taking into consideration the available resources. this paper focuses on two aspects of the sustainability of building through its life cycle; environmental and economic. for this purpose, the methodology considers reasonable costs that fit lih projects using environmentally friendly materials. the methodology is based on assessing the lcc of lih projects, taking into consideration initial cost and operation costs. the paper focuses on green-building materials with minimal cost, corresponding to the maximum number of points awarded under the leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) rating system. this methodology is developed through the formulation of the system dynamics (sd) model using a stella software package. the proposed model is capable of considering the dynamic nature and interactions among major variables affecting the assessment of economic and environmental performances of selected green materials. the proposed assessment methodology helps the decision makers in governmental housing authorities to modify the current management policies for improving the current situation of lih. in addition, it aids government and/or contractors to minimize lcc while achieving maximum leed material credit points for lih projects. a detailed case study in egypt is presented to clarify the practical features of the proposed model.

geotextile	risk assessment of infrastructure systems plays an increasingly important role in their plan, design, maintenance, retrofit and life-cycle cost evaluation taking into consideration their vulnerability to natural, technological and terrorist hazard. this paper develops a mechanistic model for seismic damageability of concrete bridges in the form of fragility curve in such a way that the model can be calibrated with the empirical fragility curves constructed on the basis of the damage data from the 1994 northridge earthquake. as often observed from this and other destructive earthquakes, bridges are one of the most vulnerable components of a highway network system subjected to earthquake ground motion. for this reason, bridge damageability information in a succinct from as fragility curve is needed to pursue the seismic risk assessment of a highway networks consisting of as large as thousands of bridges that can be affected by a high magnitude earthquake with in and near the service area of the network.

water_pollution	uv filters are the main ingredients in many cosmetics and personal care products. a significant amount of lipophilic uv filters annually enters the surface water due to large numbers of swimmers and sunbathers. the nature of these compounds cause bioaccumulation in commercial fish, particularly in estuarine areas. consequently, biomagnification in the food chain will occur. this study estimated the amount of four common uv filters (ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ehmc; octocrylene, oc; butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, bm-dbm; and benzophenone-3, bp3), which may enter surface water in the gulf of mexico. our data analysis was based on the available research data and epa standards (age classification/human body parts). the results indicated that among the 14 counties in texas coastal zones, nueces, with 43 beaches, has a high potential of water contamination through uv filters; ehmc: 477 kg year(-1); oc: 318 kg year(-1); bm-dbm: 258 kg year(-1); and bp by 159 kg year(-1). refugio county, with a minimum number of beaches, indicated the lowest potential of uv filter contamination. the sensitive estuarine areas of galveston receive a significant amount of uv filters. this article suggests action for protecting texas estuarine areas and controlling the number of tourists and ecotourism that occurs in sensitive areas of the gulf of mexico.

water_pollution	the water footprint (wf) has been developed within the water resources research community as a volumetric measure of freshwater appropriation. the concept is used to assess water use along supply chains, sustainability of water use within river basins, efficiency of water use, equitability of water allocation and dependency on water in the supply chain. with the purpose of integrating the wf in life cycle assessment of products, lca scholars have proposed to weight the original volumetric wf by the water scarcity in the catchment where the wf is located, thus obtaining a water-scarcity weighted wf that reflects the potential local environmental impact of water consumption. this paper provides an elaborate critique on this proposal. the main points are: (1) counting litres of water use differently based on the level of local water scarcity obscures the actual debate about water scarcity, which is about allocating water resources to competing uses and depletion at a global scale; (2) the neglect of green water consumption ignores the fact that green water is scarce as well; (3) since water scarcity in a catchment increases with growing overall water consumption in the catchment, multiplication of the consumptive water use of a specific process or activity with water scarcity implies that the resultant weighted wf of a process or activity will be affected by the wfs of other processes or activities, which cannot be the purpose of an environmental performance indicator; (4) the lca treatment of the wf is inconsistent with how other environmental footprints are defined; and (5) the water stress index, the most cited water scarcity metric in the lca community, lacks meaningful physical interpretation. it is proposed to incorporate the topic of freshwater scarcity in lca as a ""natural resource depletion"" category, considering depletion from a global perspective. since global freshwater demand is growing while global freshwater availability is limited, it is key to measure the comparative claim of different products on the globe 's limited accessible and usable freshwater flows.

suspension_bridge	this paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the design and construction of multiple-span suspension bridges. it starts with a brief introduction to the key issues associated with multi-span suspension bridges and then gives a historical review of this bridge form together with a list of multi-span suspension bridges constructed from 1800 to the present day. the paper looks at and compares the deflection characteristics of the classic suspension bridge with multi-span suspension bridges. the paper outlines the problems associated with this bridge form, primarily caused by increased flexibility, and the ways that they can be and have been overcome. actual bridges where they exist (or formerly existed) are referred to and the paper also looks at some current and proposed future projects using multiple-span suspension bridges. much of the recent work on this subject has been carried out in china, and translations of the abstracts of some recent chinese papers are included in an appendix to the paper.
water_pollution	stormwater quality modeling has arisen as a promising tool to develop mitigation strategies. the aim of this paper is to assess the build-up and wash-off processes and investigate the capacity of several water quality models to accurately simulate and predict the temporal variability of suspended solids concentrations in runoff, based on a long-term data set. a markov chain monte-carlo ( mcmc) technique is applied to calibrate the models and analyze the parameter 's uncertainty. the short-term predictive capacity of the models is assessed based on inter-and intra-event approaches. results suggest that the performance of the wash-off model is related to the dynamic of pollutant transport where the best fit is recorded for first flush events. assessment of swmm ( storm water management model) exponential build-up model reveals that better performance is obtained on short periods and that build-up models relying only on the antecedent dry weather period as an explanatory variable, cannot predict satisfactorily the accumulated mass on the surface. the predictive inter-event capacity of swmm exponential model proves its inability to predict the pollutograph while the intra-event approach based on data assimilation proves its efficiency for first flush events only. this method is very interesting for management practices because of its simplicity and easy implementation.
green_building	the last few decades have witnessed a rapid development of green buildings in china especially the office sector. the life cycle assessment (lca) approach has potential to weigh the benefits and costs associated with green building developments. essentially, the lca method evaluates the costs and benefits across a building 's life cycle with a system approach. in this study, a green office building in beijing, china, was analyzed by life cycle assessment to quantify its energy use and evaluate the environmental impacts in each life cycle stage. the environmental impacts can be reduced by 7.3%, 1.6% and 0.8% by using 30% gas-fired electricity generation, increasing the summer indoor temperature by 1 degrees c, and switching off office equipment and lighting during lunchtime, respectively. similarly, by reusing 80% of the selected materials when the building is finally demolished, the three major adverse environmental impacts on human health, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion can be reduced by 11.3% 12.7%, and 7.1% respectively. sensitivity analysis shows that electricity conservation is more effective than materials efficiency in terms of a reduction in environmental impacts. these findings are useful to inform decision makers in different stages of the green building life cycle.
smart_material	magnetically modified clays are low cost materials with promising properties for using in sorption of pollutants from wastewaters. the influence of extraction agents on released of iron oxides nanoparticles (nps) from magnetically modified kaolinite was studied in this article. stability of mentioned new smart material was evaluated by leaching test. characterization of prepared sample was investigated using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, x-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy, ir spectroscopy and sem. leachates were prepared according to european technical standard en 12457-2. material was interacted with demineralization water and extraction agents treated by solution of h2so4 on ph 2 and 4 or naoh solution on ph 9 and 11 by discontinuous rotation container at laboratory temperature for 24 hours. the stability of magnetically modified kaolinite was evaluated on the basis of released fe, si, al and accompanying elements in kaolinite structure. elements were determined after decomposition of filtrate in hno3 and h2o2 by atomic emission spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma.
solar_energy	a pi-conjugated microporous poly(benzothiadiazole) (hereafter denoted as bbt) is synthesized through palladium-catalyzed sonogashira-hagihara cross-coupling polycondensation, and used as a novel organic semiconductor photocatalyst for both photocatalytic h-2 production and pollutant degradation under visible light (lambda >420 nm) irradiation. furthermore, bbt/tio2 heterojunction is conveniently fabricated through an in-situ polycondensation procedure of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene in the presence of commercial tio2. after optimizing the composition ratio, the resultant bbt/tio2 heterojunction exhibited dramatically enhanced visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activities (similar to 18.0 and 20.4 times higher activity for h2 evolution and ciprofloxacin degradation, respectively) as compared bbt alone. detailed investigations revealed that the bbt/tio2 heterojunction interface can accelerate the photogenerated electron transferring from bbt to tio2, and then improve the photoactivity. the present work exhibits some interesting points and dramatic improvement of photoactivity when an organic semiconductor is combined with an inorganic one, which provides a novel direction to exploit and fabricate photocatalyst for solar energy conversion and pollutant degradation.

water_pollution	batch adsorption experiments were carried out for the removal of methylene blue (mb) cationic dye from aqueous solution using organic/inorganic hydrogel nanocomposite of titania incorporated sodium alginate crosslinked polyacrylic acid (sa-cl-poly(aa)-tio2). the hydrogel was prepared by graft copolymerization of acrylic acid (aa) onto sodium alginate (sa) biopolymer in the presence of a crosslinking agent, a free radical initiator and tio2 nanoparticles. the hydrogel exhibited a high swelling capacity of 412.98 g/g. the factors influencing adsorption capacity of the absorbents such as ph of the dye solutions, initial concentration of the dye, amount of absorbents, and temperature were investigated and used to propose a possible mechanism of adsorption. the adsorption process concurs with a pseudo-second-order kinetics and with langmuir isotherm equation. a very high adsorption capacity (q(max) = 2257.36 (mg/g)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.998 calculated from isotherm equations show the high efficiency of the absorbent and thus expected to be a good candidate as an absorbent for water treatment.

ambient_intelligence	several powerful trends are contributing to an aging of much of the world 's population, especially in economically developed countries. to mitigate the negative effects of rapidly ageing populations, societies must act early to plan for the welfare, medical care and residential arrangements of their senior citizens, and for the manpower and associated training needed to execute these plans. this paper describes the development of an ambient intelligent community care platform (aiccp), which creates an environment of ambient intelligence through the use of sensor network and mobile agent (ma) technologies. the aiccp allows caregivers to quickly and accurately locate their charges; access, update and share critical treatment and wellness data; and automatically archive all records. the aiccp presented in this paper is expected to enable caregivers and communities to offer pervasive, accurate and context-aware care services.
construction_management	the engineering measures and non-engineering measures are the two complementary supports of mountain torrent disaster control. through a series of approaches such as danger control and reinforcement, regulation construction, management system reform in recent years, reservoirs as the traditional sense of engineering measures, already have considerable capabilities of non-engineering measures, its water regime, rainfall, engineering conditions monitoring technology are improved continually, monitoring and warning system are optimized gradually, risk management consciousness and operability of emergency plan are strengthened continuously. on the base of giving full play to non-engineering measures functions and advantages of reservoir, through the comparative analysis of the existing hydrological telemetric system, monitoring system of dam safety and non-engineering measures of mountain torrent disaster control, this paper tried to share and integrate important information of reservoir and key links of implementing non-engineering measures of mountain torrent disaster control, a collaborative warning and disaster mitigation mode of non-engineering measures of reservoirs and mountain torrent disaster control was put forward. the information sharing, joint management and collaborative prediction of reservoir projects and non-engineering measures of mountain torrent disaster control were realized, and a new idea was provided to solve complicated problems such as daily management of non-engineering measures of mountain torrent disaster control and the warning information collection of sudden mountain torrent disaster control event.
construction_management	small emerging contracting companies could possibly be flooding the construction industry, putting strain on the construction economy to stay afloat, support and sustain these participants. it is important for any organisation that deals with other individuals and organisations to understand the correct ethical codes of conduct in a business environment. to minimise unethical behaviour in the industry, new contractors need to both understand and apply the principles of ethical conduct in their business environments. this research is aimed at investigating whether ethical conduct among new entry-level emerging contractors can contribute to, and ensure their sustainable competitiveness in the south african construction industry. this research is also aimed at determining whether education and knowledge of entrepreneurship, business, project and construction management, in addition to building contracts, can contribute to new entry-level emerging contractors' ethical conduct and sustainable competitiveness. the literature reviewed and the results of quantitative research among professional consultants in south africa formed the basis of the study. ethics is a sensitive topic within the construction industry; therefore, it is difficult to gather the data directly from contractors, as they are reluctant to participate for fear of revealing their identities and having this negatively influence their personal and business credentials. unbiased respondents, who were not directly linked to emerging contractors and who were not afraid to give their objective opinions, were questioned and included architects, quantity surveyors, consulting engineers, project managers, construction mentors, and construction managers. the study revealed that ethics is an important factor in any business environment and that the correct application thereof can partially contribute to the sustainable competitiveness of new entry-level emerging contractors. this, in turn, should promote the long-term survival of a business. furthermore, the knowledge of good management practices and building contracts can contribute to a successfully run business. however, the average new entry-level emerging contractor has insufficient experience and knowledge of the management of construction projects and of building contracts. the study should be valuable to construction-industry professionals, contractors and clients, as it provides them with research information on a problem area in the industry.
rainwater_harvesting	the objective of this study is to bring out the policy changes with respect to managed aquifer recharge (focusing on infiltration ponds), which in the view of relevant stakeholders may ease the problem of groundwater depletion in the context of chennai city; tamil nadu; india. groundwater is needed for the drinking water security of chennai and overexploitation has resulted in depletion and seawater intrusion. current policies at the municipal; state and national level all support recharge of groundwater and rainwater harvesting to counter groundwater depletion. however, despite such favorable policies, the legal framework and the administrative praxis do not support systematic approaches towards managed aquifer recharge in the periphery of chennai. the present study confirms this, considering the mandates of governmental key-actors and a survey of the preferences and motives of stakeholder representatives. there are about 25 stakeholder groups with interests in groundwater issues, but they lack a common vision. for example, conflicting interest of stakeholders may hinder implementation of certain types of managed aquifer recharge methods. to overcome this problem, most stakeholders support the idea to establish an authority in the state for licensing groundwater extraction and overseeing managed aquifer recharge.
ambient_intelligence	we have developed a ""network robot system"" framework with the objective of enabling practical deployment of social robots to provide real-world services in everyday social environments. this framework addresses practical issues in social human-robot interaction by integrating ambient intelligence systems, networked data stores, human supervisors, and centralized planning. all of the elements of the system have been developed and tested in public and commercial spaces such as shopping malls, resulting in a flexible robot control architecture based on practical, real-world requirements. we describe several elements of the system and demonstrate examples of its use in five years of real-world field deployments and research. finally, we present the ubiquitous network robot platform (unr-pf), an internationally-standardized high-level architecture for service robots based on our framework.
remote_sensing	shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. however, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. in addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. this study, which was conducted in ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. we applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. we found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. by contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. we checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. these results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest.

geotextile	geogrids and geotextiles are used routinely to stabilize weak subgrade soils during road construction. typical subgrade stabilization applications are temporary haul roads or unpaved low-volume roads, but can also include paved roads built on poorer foundation materials. full-scale test sections were constructed, trafficked and monitored to compare the relative operational performance of geosynthetics used as subgrade stabilization, as well as determine which material properties were most related to performance. unpaved test sections were constructed using twelve geosynthetics consisting of a variety of geogrids and geotextiles. multiple control test sections were also built to evaluate the effect that subgrade strength, base course thickness, and/ or presence of the geosynthetic had on performance. even though the geotextile materials used during this study showed good performance as subgrade stabilization, material properties associated with their performance was difficult to establish due to the limited number of test sections and lack of relevant tests to properly characterize these types of materials for this application. using longitudinal rut as the primary indicator of performance, it was determined through a linear regression analysis that the stiffness of the geogrid junctions in the cross-machine direction correlated best with performance in this application and under these conditions. using this knowledge, the design equation associated with the giroud-han method was calibrated to make geogrid junction stiffness in the cross-machine direction the primary property of the geosynthetic, thereby replacing geogrid aperture stability modulus. the calibration and verification of this method is described herein.

suspension_bridge	the new queensferry crossing near edinburgh in scotland is a cable-stayed bridge with a total length of 2 640 m and three towers up to 210 m high. the two cable supported main spans are 650 m, the two back spans are 223 m and there are approach viaducts at each end of variable spans up to 104 m. the two cable planes are arranged centrally between both carriageways and overlap in the centre of the main spans. this special feature is necessary in order to stabilize the deck and especially the centre tower. unique design features such as having the world 's longest pair of free-standing cantilevers with an overall length of 644 m and constructing the works in an exposed location experiencing adverse weather conditions, put very high demands on the engineers and workers involved. it is not only the scale and complexity of the new structure that makes it special for even experienced bridge engineers, but also its proximity to the two existing bridges over the firth of forth. the forth rail bridge, which opened in 1890 and was awarded world heritage site status in summer 2015, lies alongside the forth road bridge, a large suspension bridge opened in 1964. on completion of the queensferry crossing these bridges, representing engineering expertise from three different centuries, will form a unique collection of iconic structures. the paper summarizes the challenges in design and construction of this outstanding bridge.
green_building	the durability of building materials is a key parameter in sustainable construction. a premature deterioration of concrete structures occurs e.g. in sewage water pipelines and other concrete waste water systems due to microbial activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria (srb) and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (sob). to prolong the life time of concrete structures, concrete durability in an aggressive sulphate environment can be improved by partial replacement of cement by several waste materials. incorporation of slag, silica fume or zeolite into concrete composites can positively influence important concrete characteristics such as water absorption capacity. thus the waste-based concretes not only contribute to the increased durability of structures but also to minimization of wastes by using their in building industry. in addition, by saving the raw materials for cement production, they can be considered as resource-efficient materials and thus green building materials as well. this paper presents the results of testing water absorption capacities of concrete composites of different compositions after the 60-day exposure to sulphate bacterial environment. in 4 mixtures, cement was replaced with granulated blast furnace slag in proportions 65, 75, 85 and 95 wt. % and in 1 mixture hybrid-cement was used. the concrete specimens with and without any cement replacement were placed in sulphate environment with bacteria acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for 60 days. the experiments proceeded under model laboratory conditions. water absorption capacities were measured according to common test procedures before and after the experiments.
smart_material	the research is focused on designing interactive products, in particular on the process that leads to the conception of innovative interfaces. the interfaces discussed are tangible interfaces, which exploit their physicality and their material characteristics as input and output mechanisms in the human-product interaction process. the objective of the research is to investigate the use of interaction design methodologies in the design of smart material interfaces: interactive tangible products consisting primarily of smart materials. the overlapping between the discipline of interaction design and the world of smart materials generates new design opportunities. thanks to this overlapping, objects of daily use become able to convey information through their physical properties and use the material they are made as a communicative medium. the paper is divided in three parts. the first part investigates the role of materials in interaction design, the second part presents the brief of the research and the third one reports an experimental workshop conducted in order to elaborate new interactive metaphors for lighting design.
ambient_intelligence	the aim is to formulate a paradigm which is capable of reflecting the most innovative practices in delivering tele-medicare to patients, specifically focusing on rural and remote parts of a region. tele health therapy is not a practice area but a service delivery model that surpasses practice areas and improves access to occupational medical therapy services. the work presents an e-medicare service (tele health therapy) which is capable of providing immediate and appropriate treatment at the early stages of the medical emergencies. the urge of providing health services instantly, on demand, encourages researchers to formulate a system which can draw the health graph of the patient on the foundation of gathered parameters and compare it with ideal graph formulated on the basis of health form filled by the patient and with immediate relief graph. tele health therapy attempts to deliver initial treatment with the help of diffusion of mobile technology, fuzzy database and ambient intelligence. tele health therapy diagnoses the person, in near real time and prescribes the initial level of medication comforting the patient in recovering to the stable state till the actual medical-aid can reach them. tele-health therapy addresses the apprehension: ""if there is anything the person is not sure about its health, then they should take the opportunity to ask any questions and raise any concerns they may have.
smart_material	we propose the concept of autonomous self-damaging in ""smart"" composite materials, controlled by activation of added nanosize ""damaging"" capsules. percolation-type modeling approach earlier applied to the related concept of self-healing materials, is used to investigate the behavior of the initial material 's fatigue. we aim at achieving a relatively sharp drop in the material 's integrity after some initial limited fatigue develops in the course of the sample 's usage. our theoretical study considers a two-dimensional lattice model and involves monte carlo simulations of the connectivity and conductance in the high-connectivity regime of percolation. we give several examples of local capsule-lattice and capsule-capsule activation rules and show that the desired self-damaging property can only be obtained with rather sophisticated ""smart"" material 's response involving not just damaging but also healing capsules.

solar_energy	modified solar distillation system with different nanofluids was an emerging application area, which added various nanoparticles in saline water to enhance the ability of solar energy absorption and storage. however, there are lacked of exploration with the performance of nanofluids with saline water. therefore, the stability, optical properties and thermal conductivity of sic/saline water based nanofluids were systematically investigated in this study. the experimental results showed that sic nanofluids have good effects for enhancing the thermal conductivity with respect to base fluids (>6% increase at 0.4 vol% sic nanofluids) and have good capacity of solar absorption (<1% luminousness at 0.4 vol% sic nanofluids). with increase of salt concentration, some negative effects will affect nanofluids both in stability and thermal conductivity. therefore, an appropriate salt concentration range and nanoparticles load should be measured in practical application. moreover, 0.4 vol% sic nanofluid was prepared with natural seawater and had sufficient stable period. the thermal conductivity of seawater based nanofluid was enhanced about 5.2% with respect to base fluid. good stability, low luminousness and effective thermal property of sic nanofluids confirmed the feasibility of nanofluids application in solar distillation system.

suspension_bridge	a systematic and generic procedure for the determination of the reasonable finished state of self-anchored suspension bridges is proposed, the realization of which is mainly through adjustment of the hanger tensions. the initial hanger tensions are first obtained through an iterative analysis by combining the girder-tower-only finite element (fe) model with the analytical program for shape finding of the spatial cable system. these initial hanger tensions, together with the corresponding cable coordinates and internal forces, are then included into the fe model of the total bridge system, the nonlinear analysis of which involves the optimization technique. calculations are repeated until the optimization algorithm converges to the most optimal hanger tensions (i.e. the desired reasonable finished bridge state). the ""temperature rigid arm"" is introduced to offset the unavoidable initial deformations of the girder and tower, which are due to the huge axial forces originated from the main cable. moreover, by changing the stiffness coefficient k in the girder-tower-only fe model, the stiffness proportion of the main girder, the tower or the cable subsystem in the whole structural system could be adjusted according to the design intentions. the effectiveness of the proposed method is examined and demonstrated by one simple tutorial example and one self-anchored suspension bridge.
suspension_bridge	in this paper, the dynamic response of cable-stayed bridge loaded by a train of moving forces with stochastic velocity is investigated. the cable-stayed bridge is modelled by rayleigh beam with linear elastic supports. the stochastic melnikov method is derived and the mean-square criterion is used to determine the effects of stochastic velocity and cables number on the threshold condition for the inhibition of smale horseshoes chaos in the system. the results indicate that the intensity of the random component of the loads velocity can be contributed to the enlargement of the possible chaotic domain of the system, and/or increases the chances to have a regular behavior of the system. on the other hand, the presence of cables in cable-stayed bridges system increases it degree of safety and paradoxically can be contributed to its destabilization. numerical simulations of the governing equations are carried out to confirm the analytical prediction. the effect of loads number on the system response is also investigated.

green_building	building construction and maintenance is one of the major contributors to global warming and as a result has the potential to be a leader in sustainable development. scaffolding systems are an important component of building construction, especially high-rise buildings. a scaffold consists of a modular system of metal or bamboo tubes or pipes. scaffolding is a temporary construction structure created for reaching heights above a human 's reach, with the purpose of helping in construction or maintenance of a structure. the scaffolding industry in the us is dominated by steel. in areas where bamboo is indigenous, like many east asian cities, bamboo is the scaffolding material of choice, even when it comes to high-rise buildings. our goal was to analyze bamboo and steel thoroughly and establish their environmental impacts using life cycle analysis (lca). consequently, this study explores the ecological viability in expanding the use of bamboo scaffolding where steel predominates. the functional units used in this study are bamboo and steel scaffolding systems that are 2.74 m high, 2.49 m wide, and 1.21 m deep. a cradle-to-gate lca was performed to evaluate the environmental performance of the two scaffolding systems. our results suggest that bamboo scaffolding has a lower carbon footprint than steel scaffolding, with an ability to sequester carbon during its growth phase being a significant contributing factor. this is an important advantage of bamboo over nonrenewable materials (steel). additionally, bamboo functions as a buffer, delaying the release of co2 after the use phase. the main challenge for any scaffolding system made from renewable materials in the western world is the demand for standardization. therefore, an ideal future goal should be the design of standardized scaffolding systems using renewable materials that combines the durability and homogeneity of steel scaffolding with the sustainability and environmental performance of bamboo scaffolding.
remote_sensing	how evolutionary novelties evolve is a major question in evolutionary biology. it is widely accepted that changes in environmental conditions shift the position of selective optima, and advancements in phylogenetic comparative approaches allow the rigorous testing of such correlated transitions. a longstanding question in vertebrate biology has been the evolution of terrestrial life histories in amphibians and here, by investigating african bufonids, we test whether terrestrial modes of reproduction have evolved as adaptations to particular abiotic habitat parameters. we reconstruct and date the most complete species-level molecular phylogeny and estimate ancestral states for reproductive modes. by correlating continuous habitat measurements from remote sensing data and locality records with life-history transitions, we discover that terrestrial modes of reproduction, including viviparity evolved multiple times in this group, most often directly from fully aquatic modes. terrestrial modes of reproduction are strongly correlated with steep terrain and low availability of accumulated water sources. evolutionary transitions to terrestrial modes of reproduction occurred synchronously with or after transitions in habitat, and we, therefore, interpret terrestrial breeding as an adaptation to these abiotic conditions, rather than an exaptation that facilitated the colonization of montane habitats.
water_pollution	this paper provides a systematic study of the location choice of new polluting firms driven by the 11th five-year plan 's water pollution reduction mandates in china. we explore a unique dataset of environmental statistics, which contains 31380 polluting manufacturing firms newly established in the period 2006-2010. our conditional logit model provides strong evidence for the changes of new polluting firms' location choice from the coastal provinces, which have strict environmental mandates, to the western provinces, which have lax environmental mandates, and demonstrates the distinct location patterns of heterogeneous polluting firms. while foreign polluting firms were generally driven by the mandates, domestic polluting firms were more resistant and were driven to the western provinces only after 2007. as a result, the potential pollution transfer would threaten the more fragile water environments and public health in western provinces. we thus posit a perverse incentive of current environmental policy and recommend integrated water management as well as close coordination of local governments to improve the efficacy of environmental regulation in china. journal of comparative economics 45 (2017) 119-138. state key laboratory of pollution control & resource reuse, school of environment, nanjing university, nanjing 210023, p r china; school of government, nanjing university, nanjing 210093, pr china; school of business, nanjing university, nanjing 210023, p r china; hopkins nanjing center, nanjing 210023, p r china.

solar_energy	one of the main problems in micro unmanned aerial vehicles (uav) is endurance or flight time since the general domain aircraft use conventional fuel. using conventional fuel is a pollutant, have a limited life and costly. so there is a huge demand for using an unlimited non-exhaustible source of energy as a fuel. as solar energy is one of the available renewable energy, it can be used to increase the endurance of uav without adding significant mass nor by increasing the size of the fuel system. by considering the basic challenges for a solar powered aircraft which are a geographical area of operation, energy collection and storage, payload and design parameters, a plane was designed & fabricated by incorporating the solar cells onto the wing. here at first how much energy is available from the sun to power the entire plane was conceptually analyzed and then it was verified with experimental results. finally, the energy and exergy efficiencies were calculated and analyzed, as exergy is an important tool in addressing the influence of utilizing the energy resources on the environment.

suspension_bridge	this paper provides an overview on development of long-span bridges monitoring in japan, with emphasis on monitoring strategies, types of monitoring system, and effective utilization of monitoring data. because of severe environment condition such as high seismic activity and strong wind, bridge monitoring systems in japan historically put more emphasis on structural evaluation against extreme events. monitoring data were used to verify design assumptions, update specifications, and facilitate the efficacy of vibration control system. these were among the first objectives of instrumentation of long-span bridges in a framework of monitoring system in japan. later, monitoring systems were also utilized to evaluate structural performance under various environment and loading conditions, and to detect the possible structural deterioration over the age of structures. monitoring systems are also employed as the basis of investigation and decision making for structural repair and/or retrofit when required. more recent interest has been to further extend application of monitoring to facilitate operation and maintenance, through rationalization of risk and asset management by utilizing monitoring data. the paper describes strategies and several examples of monitoring system and lessons learned from structural monitoring of long-span bridges in japan.
water_pollution	this study discusses about the biosorption of cr(vi) ion from aqueous solution using ultrasonic assisted spirulina platensis (uasp). the prepared uasp biosorbent was characterised by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, brunauer-emmet-teller, scanning electron spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray and thermogravimetric analyses. the optimum condition for the maximum removal of cr(vi) ions for an initial concentration of 50mg/l by uasp was measured as: adsorbent dose of 1g/l, ph of 3.0, contact time of 30min and temperature of 303k. adsorption isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamic parameters were calculated. freundlich model provided the best results for the removal of cr(vi) ions by uasp. the adsorption kinetics of cr(vi) ions onto uasp showed that the pseudo-first-order model was well in line with the experimental data. in the thermodynamic study, the parameters like gibb 's free energy, enthalpy and entropy changes were evaluated. this result explains that the adsorption of cr(vi) ions onto the uasp was exothermic and spontaneous in nature. desorption of the biosorbent was done using different desorbing agents in which naoh gave the best result. the prepared material showed higher affinity for the removal of cr(vi) ions and this may be an alternative material to the existing commercial adsorbents.
geotextile	this study produces composite geotextile, and evaluates its effectiveness of being used for soil protection. kevlar fibers, high strength polyethylene terephthalate (hpet) fibers, recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rpet) fibers, and nylon grids are made into kevlar/pet/nylon composite geotextiles, which are then tested for air permeability, and tensile, tearing, and bursting strength. the experimental results show that when the ratio of kevlar fibers to hpet is 0/40, the resulting composite geotextile has the optimum mechanical properties, where the tensile strength is approximately 990 n, tearing strength is approximately 890 n, bursting strength is approximately 3700, and an air permeability is around 35 cm(3)/cm(2)/s.
suspension_bridge	this paper presents a method to extract flutter derivatives of bridge decks based on a combination of the computational fluid dynamics (cfd), system simulations and system identifications. the incompressible solver adopts an arbitrary lagrangian-eulerian (ale) formulation with the finite volume discretization in space. the imposed sectional motion in heaving or pitching relies on exponential time series as input, with aerodynamic forces time histories acting on the section evaluated as output. system identifications are carried out to fit coefficients of the inputs and outputs of arma models, as to establish discrete-time aerodynamic models. system simulations of the established models are then performed as to obtain the lift and moment exerting on the sections to a sinusoidal displacement. it follows that flutter derivatives are identified. the present approaches are applied to a hexagon thin plate and a real bridge deck. the results are compared to the theodorsen closed-form solution and those from wind tunnel tests. satisfactory agreements are observed.
green_building	china faces a challenge to balance its future urbanization process with resource conservation and environmental protection. promoting sustainable construction is identified by the chinese government as an important strategy to tackle such challenges. to promote sustainable construction, the chinese government has released a large number of laws, policies and regulations. this paper investigates the policy system in china which aims to facilitate the transition to sustainable construction. the related laws, policies and regulations are analyzed and three main functions are identified, namely regulation and control, economic incentives and supporting activities. the results show that the behaviours of various participants in the construction industry, including the government, developers, builders, suppliers, and designers, are regulated and controlled by these laws and regulations. subsidy policies, award policies and economic innovation policies are adopted by the government to promote renewable energy applications in buildings and infrastructure construction. the key supporting activities for sustainable construction include strengthening technology innovation, improving standards and evaluation, establishing demonstration projects, and publicity. two emerging challenges of the current policy system are also identified. they are: a lack of considering social and economic dimensions of sustainable construction, and the ineffectiveness of some key policies such as the environmental impact assessment policy. this paper provides a useful reference for construction corporations and policy makers in china to facilitate sustainable construction in future urbanization process. similarly, policy makers in other emerging economies can understand how sustainable construction is promoted in china.

water_pollution	surface water is at risk from marcellus shale operations because of chemical storage on drill pads during hydraulic fracturing operations, and the return of water high in total dissolved solids (up to 345 g/l) from shale gas production. this research evaluated how two commercial, off-the-shelf water quality sensors responded to simulated surface water pollution events associated with marcellus shale development. first, peak concentrations of contaminants from typical spill events in monitored watersheds were estimated using regression techniques. laboratory measurements were then conducted to determine how standard in-stream instrumentation that monitor conductivity, ph, temperature, and dissolved oxygen responded to three potential spill materials: ethylene glycol (corrosion inhibitor), drilling mud, and produced water. solutions ranging from 0 to 50 ppm of each spill material were assessed. over this range, the specific conductivity increased on average by 19.9, 27.9, and 70 mu s/cm for drilling mud, ethylene glycol, and produced water, respectively. on average, minor changes in ph (0.5-0.8) and dissolved oxygen (0.13-0.23 ppm) were observed. while continuous monitoring may be part of the strategy for detecting spills to surface water, these minor impacts to water quality highlight the difficulty in detecting spill events. when practical, sensors should be placed at the mouths of small watersheds where drilling activities or spill risks are present, as contaminant travel distance strongly affects concentrations in surface water systems.
geotextile	in the design of revetment engineering under wave action, to resist the wave action, the pattern of top layer - filter layer - core(subsoil) is often adopted. in general, the structure of top layer is usually single discrete blocks, typically accropode blocks, four-leg square hollow blocks and barrier boards, and also acropode, riprap, paved rock blocks or concrete slabs where with smaller waves. such top layer has been provided with many research findings on its stability and is widely used in engineering. setting a filter layer between the top layer and the lower dike core mainly has two functions: (1) giving certain permeability, to minimize the hydrodynamic load directly acting on the lower foundation soil; (2) giving certain hydraulic tightness, to prevent fine sediment of the lower foundation soil being rushed out. this paper is focused on a special filter layer with geotextile as its upper structure and coarse aggregate as its lower structure. by simulating geotextile with different permeability and coarse aggregate with different size, the pressure of top of cover layer and the down side of the geotextile is tested under wave actions, and compared with theoretical analysis, in this way, how the permeability of geotextile impacts the stability of top layer is studyed. the research shows that when the lower coarse aggregate under the geotextile has high permeability and the geotextile 's permeability get poorer, the uplift force to the top layer will be increased under wave action, which will cause damage to the top layer when it si greater than the vertical component force of the block gravity under the water.

remote_sensing	to advance the investigation of vegetated terrain using polarimetric remote sensing techniques, it is important to determine the electromagnetic properties of key constituents, such as branches and trunks, which may be realistically modeled by tapered cylinders. to this end, we apply our previously proposed virtual partition method (vpm). numerical simulations demonstrate that vpm possesses the desired features, such as high fidelity prediction of the scattering amplitude function and fulfillment of energy conservation as well as the reciprocity theorem. it thus may be helpful in the pursuit of better coherent scattering models of vegetated terrain, a finer understanding of polinsar imagery, and a better characterization of scattering mechanisms.
construction_management	this study aim to identify the mismatch between industries requirement and students perception towards the entry level construction managers' roles and tasks. a total of 153 construction management 's students from malaysian public universities (uitm, usm and uthm) participated in this study. data were collected using a questionnaire and analysed by rasch model. semi structure interview was conducted in verifying and explaining the quantitative result. result from the study, shows six over eight similarities towards the entry level construction managers' roles and task. data from the semi structured interview clarify the mismatch exist due to the lack of exposure to students during their internship with the construction company. this lack of experience and knowledge lead to the students' misperception towards the entry level construction managers' roles and tasks.
smart_material	a new method to reconfigure, tune or program an antenna is presented and validated through a fabricated proof-of-concept prototype. the method relies on the changing electrical properties of a smart material, vanadium dioxide (vo2), across its solid-to-solid phase transition. the phase change in the material is induced thermally. the developed device is a monolithically integrated vo2-based antenna that changes resonant frequency on demand. details and challenges related to the design, fabrication and integration of vo2 thin films with antennas, as well as the measurement setup, are discussed. measurement results match well with theory and simulations. results unveil a new technique for reconfiguring antennas and suggest further studies and improvements could lead to more exciting results and make vanadium dioxide thin-films an alternate solution for multi-functional antennas. this work is the first prototype to implement this new reconfiguration mechanism in antennas in the gigahertz range and to present results during the vo2 metal-to-insulator phase transition.
remote_sensing	flood events cause substantial damage to urban and rural areas. monitoring water extent during large-scale flooding is crucial in order to identify the area affected and to evaluate damage. during such events, spatial assessments of floodwater may be derived from satellite or airborne sensing platforms. meanwhile, an increasing availability of smartphones is leading to documentation of flood events directly by individuals, with information shared in real-time using social media. topographic data, which can be used to determine where floodwater can accumulate, are now often available from national mapping or governmental repositories. in this work, we present and evaluate a method for rapidly estimating flood inundation extent based on a model that fuses remote sensing, social media and topographic data sources. using geotagged photographs sourced from social media, optical remote sensing and high-resolution terrain mapping, we develop a bayesian statistical model to estimate the probability of flood inundation through weights-of-evidence analysis. our experiments were conducted using data collected during the 2014 uk flood event and focus on the oxford city and surrounding areas. using the proposed technique, predictions of inundation were evaluated against ground-truth flood extent. the results report on the quantitative accuracy of the multisource mapping process, which obtained area under receiver operating curve values of 0.95 and 0.93 for model fitting and testing, respectively.
water_pollution	water pollution is one of the most pervasive problems afflicting people all over the world, while adsorption is the most impactful method to remove the organic pollutants from water. to demonstrate this, a facile and efficient approach is extendable to prepare porous polyurea monolith as a new type of adsorbent for water purification in our research. in order to obtain the porous polyurea monolith, the reaction only between tdi monomer and vapor by using the centrifugally spinning moulding is prepared. notably, the results show that centrifugally spinning moulding is an effective method to form the whole block structure. according to the specific surface area, pore size and pore size distribution of porous polyurea monolith are affected at different centrifugal speeds. the porous polyurea monolith has continuous interconnected fiber-like clusters skeletal structure, which is composed of mesopores and maropores. moreover, the porous polyurea monolith could adsorb oils and organic solvents from water fast, which can be attribute to its highly hydrophobic and oleophilic properties.

rainwater_harvesting	rainfall shortages constrain small-holders' agricultural production in developing countries and with ongoing climate change these shortages may increase in volume and frequency. rainwater harvesting irrigation is an interesting technology that decreases this risk. therefore, one would expect an increasing use of this technology in drought-prone areas, particularly for large and wealthy farms. this study investigated the relation between farm size and share of irrigated land among smallholders from two regions in ethiopia. it also analyzed which factors explain the share of irrigated land using panel data collected in 2005 and 2010. a random effects tobit model was estimated for the share of irrigated land as a function of variables affecting returns, market prices, source of finance, and expectation formation. the findings show that the share of irrigated land declines with farm size. moreover, the share of irrigated land depends on distance to market, ease of selling output, age, aridity, distance from natural water sources, credit access, and regional differences. these results question the relevance of water harvesting for farm enlargement. however, they also show that by safeguarding the availability of credit and improving local infrastructure farmers may extend the share of land irrigated by harvested water.

solar_energy	the arid conditions in northern chile restrict the access to water and energy. this work describes the experimental behavior of a solar water heating system combined with floating covers and photovoltaic cells. two similar ponds were used for holding water, one heated and the other unheated. the heated pond featured a coil containing an enclosed circulating fluid heated by solar heat collectors. to minimize water evaporation the exposed surfaces of the two ponds were covered by floating elements with photovoltaic cells on top to supply energy for water pumping and to power auxiliary devices of the system. predicted daily average water temperature values determined from a heat and mass transfer model using experimental meteorological data over eight months of continuous operation were in very good agreement with measured data. the pond with floating covers water evaporation reduction was greater than 90% with respect to an uncovered pond. also the photovoltaic cells placed on the floating cover generated up to 68 wp/m(2) equivalent to electric power. the global average for the daily water solar heating that was measured in the pond was equivalent to 420 kwh/m(2).

ambient_intelligence	this paper addresses the need to enhance transparency in ambient intelligent environments by developing more natural ways of interaction, which allow the users to communicate easily with the hidden networked devices rather than embedding obtrusive tablets and computing equipment throughout their surroundings. ambient intelligence vision aims to realize digital environments that adapt to users in a responsive, transparent, and context-aware manner in order to enhance users' comfort. it is, therefore, appropriate to employ the paradigm of ""computing with words"" (cwws), which aims to mimic the ability of humans to communicate transparently and manipulate perceptions via words. one of the daily activities that would increase the comfort levels of the users (especially people with disabilities) is cooking and performing tasks in the kitchen. existing approaches on food preparation, cooking, and recipe recommendation stress on healthy eating and balanced meal choices while providing limited personalization features through the use of intrusive user interfaces. herein, we present an application, which transparently interacts with users based on a novel cwws approach in order to predict the recipe 's difficulty level and to recommend an appropriate recipe depending on the user 's mood, appetite, and spare time. the proposed cwws framework is based on linear general type-2 (lgt2) fuzzy sets, which linearly quantify the linguistic modifiers in the third dimension in order to better represent the user perceptions while avoiding the drawbacks of type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy sets. the lgt2-based cwws framework can learn from user experiences and adapt to them in order to establish more natural human-machine interaction. we have carried numerous real-world experiments with various users in the university of essex intelligent flat. the comparison analysis between interval type-2 fuzzy sets and lgt2 fuzzy sets demonstrates up to 55.43% improvement when general type-2 fuzzy sets are used than when interval type-2 fuzzy sets are used instead. the quantitative and qualitative analysis both show the success of the system in providing a natural interaction with the users for recommending food recipes where the quantitative analysis shows the high statistical correlation between the system output and the users' feedback; the qualitative analysis presents social science evaluation confirming the strong user acceptance of the system.

solar_energy	the impact to the optical environment result from shading of pv panels becomes concerned. this paper describes how to calculate illumination level on the land around tracking pv (both isolated and arrayed) panel. the land under the flat-plate pv is dark by shading, but the influence from the tracking pv is not very significant, typically half in average. this is because shadow by tracking panel moves. the shading influence is further decreased with the increase of pedestal height. with this advantage, tracking pv can be combined with agriculture as a double use of the land.

suspension_bridge	on-going developments in smart technologies such as wireless sensor networks, micro-electro-mechanical systems (mems), computer vision, fibre optics and advanced data interpretation techniques may revolutionise structural health monitoring (shm). dedicated shm of bridge assets has the potential to produce valuable data-sets and provide owners and managers with information to aid with key questions such as: current performance, margins of safety, actual loading, stress history and risk of fatigue, extent of deterioration and residual life. however, the parameters measured and value of the data obtained will differ when viewed from the perspectives of different stakeholders such as asset owners, designers, contractors and researchers. in this paper the purposes of monitoring are reviewed. a methodology is proposed to facilitate formal discussions between the key stakeholders before any deployment is specified and to ensure that scarce resources are not wasted in the pursuit of data as opposed to information. this approach can be used to determine if there is a prima facie case for the specification of shm on a project and assess the potential value of any information that may be obtained. the developed methodology has been trialled with five historical monitoring case studies on bridges with which the authors are familiar.
water_pollution	in this study we provide a computerized graph structure for synthesizing and displaying the data on a region 's ecosystem-economic system. by applying mathematica-based graph modeling we create a causal network of the synergistic impact mechanism among certain climate related factors. our computational approach identifies a climate factor that affects most immediately or most strongly the others. important factors are indicated through the use of graph theoretical tools. our graph-based approach and its computational aspects allow for factor ranking(s) according to their importance to the network both numerically and visually, for certain settlement types. our contribution provides quantitative estimates of impacts and adaptation potentials of five potential effects of climate change ( migration, flooding-landslides-fire, air and water pollution, human health and energy-water-other resources) which play a substantial role at the synergistic impact mechanism. by using graph visualization techniques, the structure of the synergistic impact mechanism is selfevident. specifically, graph layouts are created to detect i) the causal relationships of the synergistic mechanism under study ii) the most influential factor(s) in the synergistic mechanism and iii) classify the factor 's roles (based on the degree of their impact) within the coping mechanism. highlighting graph elements let information for policy implications stand out.

solar_energy	a free-space optical communication system with a sun light directly pumped laser as the signal transmitter was demonstrated. a 0.6 x 0.6 m fresnel lens was used as the primary concentrator to collect the solar light. 6.8 w continuous wave laser power was obtained from a 4 mm diameter grooved nd:yag rod. the output intensity was modulated with a video signal via a linbo3 mach-zehnder optoelectronic modulator. the video signal with a resolution of 1920 * 1080/frame and the frame rate of 25 hz was transmitted over five-meter free-space in real time with high fidelity. the transmission rate was 125 mbps and bit error rate was lower than 10(-6). this research shows the feasibility of applying a solar light directly pumped laser for free-space optical communication, which is significant for telecommunications between satellites.
suspension_bridge	early engineers drew heavily for exemplars on the achievements of the past. telford 's employment as a county surveyor involved restoration of existing works. however, engineers were often accused of despoiling the existing environment; telford himself was involved in the destruction of the precinct of st katharine 's by the tower of london, and there are abundant examples of railways showing scant concern for the heritage through which they passed. in contrast, engineers like benjamin baker and francis fox used their engineering skills to extend the life of threatened structures. there is frequent debate between those seeking to improve the existing infrastructure and those who want such improvements to take account of the historic engineering heritage. recent examples include the strengthening of brunel 's thames tunnel and network rail 's improvement works in manchester. heritage successes are often based on a few committed individuals using their engineering knowledge to mount successful campaigns. despite more powerful analytical tools and ever-improving monitoring technology, structures like the internationally significant union suspension bridge are under threat. some may argue it all comes down to money, but is it in part a result of engineers' education and their lack of knowledge of their own heritage and sense of place?
suspension_bridge	using fixed point techniques, we study the existence and multiplicity of positive radial solutions for two classes of nonlocal elliptic systems defined on bounded annular domains or exterior domains. to this end, we reduce our problem to second-order functional ordinary elliptic systems. our approach also allows us to study systems involving various orders, which serve as models for the suspension bridge equations.
solar_energy	the heat transfer and entropy generation in a magnetohydrodynamic flow of al2o3-water nanofluid through a porous vertical microchannel with nonlinear radiative heat flux were investigated numerically. then, combined effects of nanoparticle volume fraction, hydrodynamic slip, magnetic field, suction/injection and thermal radiation on heat transfer and entropy generation were studied. the dimensionless governing equations were solved numerically by applying runge-kutta integration method together with shooting technique. in this study, the accuracy of the numerical results was verified by comparing its predictions with exact solutions of model without both radiation effects and buoyancy force. here, different from previous literature, heat transfer subject to nonlinear thermal radiation; joule heating and viscous dissipation was solved and analyzed using conjugate convective-radiative heat transfer on the boundary surfaces. moreover, influences of pertinent parameters on nanofluid velocity, temperature, local and global entropy generation and nusselt number were discussed in detail and illustrated graphically. based on the numerical results, it was proved that the global entropy generation decreased with both nanoparticle volume fraction and suction/injection reynolds number while it increased with grashof number (buoyancy force intensity), radiation parameter and conduction-radiation parameter. in addition, it was possible to determine optimum values of slip flow with minimum values of global entropy generation rate. the nusselt number was also calculated and explored for different conditions. in this way, optimum values of grashof number with maximum heat transfer on the heated left plate were derived.

ambient_intelligence	this paper proposes the use of an autonomous assistant mobile robot in order to monitor the environmental conditions of a large indoor area and develop an ambient intelligence application. the mobile robot uses single high performance embedded sensors in order to collect and geo-reference environmental information such as ambient temperature, air velocity and orientation and gas concentration. the data collected with the assistant mobile robot is analyzed in order to detect unusual measurements or discrepancies and develop focused corrective ambient actions. this paper shows an example of the measurements performed in a research facility which have enabled the detection and location of an uncomfortable temperature profile inside an office of the research facility. the ambient intelligent application has been developed by performing some localized ambient measurements that have been analyzed in order to propose some ambient actuations to correct the uncomfortable temperature profile.
green_building	incorporating sustainability in construction can result in desirable building attributes and project life cycle. the leadership in engineering and environmental design (leed (r)) rating system helps project teams make the right green building decisions for their projects through a process. however, in current practice, project teams do not have a systematic procedure or tool for choosing the leed credits appropriate for a particular project. the researchers have developed a tool, which support the leed integrative process during a charrette, and developed an optimization model that can be utilized to assist project teams determine which credits to pursue for leed certification, taking into account potential benefits associated with any leed credit. the tool enables owners to incorporate sustainability in construction by helping the project teams make the right green building decisions for their projects through an integrated procedure.
ambient_intelligence	big data visualization relies on an interdisciplinary research area that includes mass data storage and retrieval, operations, analytics, security, ethics as well as visualization and interaction with end users. this paper reports on the characteristics of big data systems, mainly focusing on information visualization and discusses a number of methods towards this direction, analyzing research issues and challenges that emerge. additionally, this paper discusses new approaches for big data visualization in the context of ambient intelligence (ami) environments, highlighting new aspects in the field in respect to information presentation and natural user interaction. furthermore, a scenario of big data visualization in ami environments is presented, aiming at bringing to surface the new potential of such approaches in terms of interaction simplification, and adaptation to the context of use.
solar_energy	the performance of solar energy conversion into alternative energy sources in artificial systems highly depends on the thermostability of photosystem i (psi) complexes terasaki et al. (2007), iwuchukwu et al. (2010), kothe et al. (2013). to assess the thermostability of psi complexes from the thermophilic cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus elongatus heating induced perturbations on the level of secondary structure of the proteins were studied. changes were monitored by fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectra in the mid-ir region upon slow heating (1 degrees c per minute) of samples in d2o phosphate buffer (pd 7.4) from 20 degrees c to 100 degrees c. these spectra showed distinct changes in the amide i region of psi complexes as a function of the rising temperature. absorbance at the amide i maximum of psi monomers (centered around 1653 cm(-1)), gradually dropped in two temperature intervals, i.e. 60-75 and 80-90 degrees c. in contrast, absorbance at the amide i maximum of psi trimers (around 1656 cm(-1)) dropped only in one temperature interval 80-95 degrees c. the thermal profile of the spectral shift of alpha-helices bands in the region 1656-1642 cm(-1) confirms the same two temperature intervals for psi monomers and only one interval for trimers. apparently, the observed absorbance changes at the amide i maximum during heating of psi monomers and trimers are caused by deformation and unfolding of alpha-helices. the absence of absorbance changes in the interval of 20-65 degrees c in psi trimers is probably caused by a greater stability of protein secondary structure as compared to that in monomers. upon heating above 80 degrees c a large part of alpha-helices both in trimers and monomers converts to unordered and aggregated structures. spectral changes of psi trimers and monomers heated up to 100 degrees c are irreversible due to protein denaturation and non-specific aggregation of complexes leading to new absorption bands at 1618-1620 cm(-1). we propose that monomers shield the denaturation sensitive sides at the monomer/monomer interface within a trimer, making the oligomeric structure more stable against thermal stress.

ambient_intelligence	ontologies have been becoming popular knowledge representation methods very particularly for the areas of semantic web and smart environments. this paper focuses on design of ""user behaviour ontologies"" in ambient intelligence (ami) environment using ontology creation tool. sensors are installed in the environment so that users' behaviour will be sensed and stored by the devices in that environment. the stored behaviour data will be refined and formed as a temporal sequence. then the ontology will be constructed through mapping relations between behaviour and related temporal sequence. this work demonstrated the different ways of ontological representations. the advantage of this approach is that it makes the cognitive support easier to the teachers.

stealth_technology	object coated with plasma has stimulated great interests of many people because of its stealth capability. the study on a conducting cylinder coated with coaxial plasma is very much, but there are little works on a conducting cylinder coated with eccentric plasma. in this article, a model for a conducting cylinder coated with eccentric unmagnetized plasma is set up, the scattering cross section of the object cylinder is studied by adopting the superposition of cylindrical wave functions and the coordinate transformation, where these wave functions are the solutions of maxwell 's equations with boundary conditions in cylindrical coordinates. the results show that the radar cross section for a conducting cylinder coated with eccentric plasma in every direction decrease obviously with an increase of the distance between two eccentric axes, but is almost not impacted by electronneutral collision frequency of plasma, and the backscattering cross section of the target reduce with the increase of electron density. comparing with the coaxial model, the backscattering cross section of the eccentric model has a smaller value in a wide frequency band. this is of significance for the target plasma stealth technology in practice.
suspension_bridge	wireless sensor networks based-structural health monitoring is being widely researched. to make a better structural health monitoring, real-time acquisition of structural responses is indispensable. however, the data, which is large in number especially when they are of moving structures, are difficult to be measured, and the adaptation of wireless sensor networks further limits structural health monitoring within the capacity of radio frequency. in this study, cochlea-inspired artificial filter bank was developed as a technological way to efficiently acquire dynamic responses at a wireless sensor networks based-structural health monitoring. the cochlea-inspired artificial filter bank developed in this article was enabled to acquire valid dynamic responses of compressed size around the frequency range of interest by simulating raw data to the full regarding to time and frequency of dynamic responses. in addition, the digitalized cochlea-inspired artificial filter bank was also found to fix the disadvantages of analogue filters by its easy and efficient development of logics, optimization, design of software, and real-time autonomous execution. finally, the cochleainspired artificial filter bank makes it possible to compress and reduce the vast amount of real-time dynamic responses usually obtained by means of a uniform rate of sample, into a manageable size. it is thus expected to open up a new paradigm in the wireless sensor networks based-structural health monitoring of civil structures by facilitating an efficient measurement and management of data base.
smart_material	integration of smart patches into full-tension splice connectors in overhead power transmission lines was investigated. lead zirconate titanate (pzt) -5a was used as a smart material and an aluminum beam was used as a host structure. negative electrode termination was examined by using copper adhesive tape and direct bonding methods. various commercial adhesives were studied for pzt integration onto the host structure. aluminum beam specimens with integrated pzt smart patches were tested under thermal cycling at a temperature of 125 degrees c, which is the higher-end temperature experienced by in-service aluminum conductor steel-reinforced cables. electromechanical impedance (emi) measurements were conducted at room temperature, and the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the conductance signals was used to analyze the emi data. it has been shown that the negative electrode method has an important effect on the performance of the integrated pzt. the pzt displayed more susceptibility to cracking when copper tape was used than when direct bonding was used. the reliability of pzt in direct bonding depended on the adhesives used in bonding layers. although a hard alumina-based adhesive can lead to cracking of the pzt, a high-temperature epoxy with adequate flexibility, such as duralco 4538d, can provide the desired performance under target thermal cycling conditions. the rmsd parameter can characterize conductance signatures effectively. it also was demonstrated that rmsd can be used to quantify the fatigue of the pzt integration system, although rmsd is used primarily as a damage index in monitoring structural health.

construction_management	although various factors have been identified as important for a successful briefing process, few studies appear to have undertaken a comprehensive analysis using factor analysis to systematically categorize the views of professionals on the relative importance of briefing process critical success factors (csfs). this paper is intended to fill this research gap. a survey was conducted in hong kong, the united kingdom, the united states, and australia to collect the opinions of construction professionals regarding csfs for construction project briefing. through factor analysis, reliability, and validity analyses, the following seven csfs were established: (1)client 's business, organization, and project requirements; (2)requirements of stakeholders; (3)knowledge, experience, and cultural background of the stakeholders; (4)decision making and management skills of the senior project managers; (5)competence of the design team; (6)balanced interest of the stakeholders; and (7)the process of briefing. although this research study involves a limited sample size, the survey findings and hands-on experience of the relevant industrial practitioners can be cross referenced to similar investigations in other parts of the world for international comparisons. the csfs systematically identified and categorized enable practitioners in the construction industry to manage the briefing process successfully.
smart_material	this paper presents a smart way to actuate and control the airfoil shape of a morphing wing in the open-loop architecture. the actuation system uses smart material actuators such as shape memory alloys, disposed in two parallel actuation lines, and its control is performed with a mamdani-type fuzzy logic proportional derivative (pd) controller. the morphing wing project description, its actuation system structure, and the control design and validation are highlighted in this paper. the results obtained by both numerical simulation and experimental validation (bench tests and wind-tunnel tests) are presented as part of the control design and validation. an analysis of the wind flow characteristics, based on the information provided by the pressure sensors mounted on the flexible skin of the morphing wing in the wind-tunnel tests, is included as a supplementary validation; the transition between laminar and turbulent flows is real-time visualized, and the aerodynamic efficiency of the controlled morphing wing is evaluated.

solar_energy	the well-defined one-dimensional (1d) cds@mos2 (cm) core-shell nanowires are constructed by employing cds nanowires (cds nws) as nanobuilding blocks via a facile hydrothermal strategy. the synergistic interaction, stemming from the large and intimate coaxial interfacial contact between mos2 thin shell and 1d cds core, can efficiently retard the charge carrier recombination and the mos2 as noble metal-free cocatalyst enriches the active sites for h-2 evolution from water. consequently, in comparison to bare cds nanowires, the resultant 1d core-shell cm composite exhibits distinctly enhanced visible light activity for the evolution of h-2. notably, the activity of 1d cm with the optimized 2 wt% of mos2 exceeds that of pure cds and cds-1 wt% pt composite by a factor of 64 and 4 times, respectively, under identical reaction conditions, while the apparent quantum yield (a.qy.) at 420 nm over 1d cm reaches 28.5%. this work provides a simple paradigm for facile and finely controlled synthesis of well-shaped 1d-based composite photocatalysts towards boosted solar energy conversion.

green_building	identifying the key factors that influence commercial buildings' decision to obtain voluntary green certificates is essential to building sustainability enhancement. using commercial buildings in the state of new york, multinomial logit and nested logit models demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between the characteristics of commercial buildings (such as square footage, lot size, and years built) and green certification. more interestingly, if a commercial building is occupied by its owner, likelihood of green certification is actually smaller. this finding not only confirms that ongoing energy savings are heavily discounted when deciding whether to incur the upfront cost of green certification, but also suggests that the rental premium enjoyed by green buildings is likely greater in terms of present value than the expected operating cost savings. another explanation could be that investor owners must operate in a competitive market for tenants while owner-occupiers do not operate in that competitive market, so they do not need to obtain green certificates to attract tenants. consequently for policymakers, building owners that plan to rent out their commercial property space should be the early targets to promote green certification.
suspension_bridge	this paper deals with control strategies for the mitigation of unwanted vibrations in typical medium and long-span cable-supported bridges, aiming to underline general observations and side effects related to the adoption of different control strategies. two finite-element models of medium and long-span bridges, namely a suspension and a cable-stayed bridge, are developed for simulating the structural response under wind and earthquake excitation. passive and semi-active control strategies are then implemented in the models for mitigating dynamic effects. such control schemes have been designed for wind excitation on the suspension bridge, and seismic excitation on the cable-stayed bridge. attention is initially focused on high-intensity loading conditions, having a low probability of occurrence. the same control strategies and arrangements have then been re-assessed by changing the input intensity; in addition, a cross-check has been performed by addressing earthquake actions on the suspension bridge and wind forces on the cable-stayed bridge. the results have been also analysed in terms of indirect effects, such as fatigue damage.
smart_material	a key element in developing high-performance smart material electrohydraulic actuators is the design of improved check valves for high-frequency fluid rectification. one method to create valves with fast frequency response is to replace the single-reed valves typically used in these systems with an array of miniature-reed valves. a robust miniature-reed design is presented to overcome the fatigue and fabrication limitations observed in previous approaches. the fluid-structure interaction between an individual valve and hydraulic fluid is modeled using the multiphysics software comsol; the results are validated with experimental testing on an array of miniature reeds. the performance of this array in a smart material actuator is compared with a larger, single-reed valve design. the miniature-reed array is shown to reliably rectify flow in the high-pressure and high-frequency environment of a smart material pump.
suspension_bridge	heavily cold drawing pearlitic steel wires are widely used for aerospace, tire cord, suspension bridge cable, and architecture due to the high strength with acceptable level of ductility. for marine steel wires, which are widely applied in the marine and offshore structures enduring the effect of stress and corrosion, the corrosion performance is significant. corrosion is a primary cause of structural deterioration for marine and offshore structures, which results in structural failure, leakage, product loss, environmental pollution and the loss of life. nu- merous studies have been devoted to the microstructure evolution or cementite dissolution induced by cold drawing. with respect to the effect of microstructure evolution on the performance of pearlitic steel, the views were mainly focused on the mechanical performance, and only a little attention was paid to the effect of microstructure evolution on the corrosion behavior of pearlitic steel. hence, it is still unclear whether and how the cold drawing influences the corrosion resistance of pearlitic steel. in this work, the effect of microstructure evolution on the pitting corrosion of pearlitic steel was investigated. the electrochemical measurements were carried out by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic measurement. meanwhile, the corrosion morphology after immersion for 5 d was observed by standard visual techniques. the results indicate that corrosion resistance of cross section decreases with increasing the strain of cold drawing, while the corrosion resistance of longitudinal section decreases in the first stage of cold drawing (strain epsilon <= 1.2) but increases in the second step of cold drawing (epsilon=1.6). by characterizing the distribution of pits in the evolutionary microstructure induced by cold drawing, the grain boundary, the pearlite colony boundary and the phase boundary where the pits are inclined to initiate and propagation, are sensitive to pitting. thus, the decrease of corrosion resistance of cross section and longitudinal section in the first stage of cold drawing (epsilon <= 1.2) is due to the multiplication of interface, which increases the pitting sensibility of microstructure. electron backscattered scattering detection was used to quantify the content oftexture of pearlitic steels with different strains. the result showed that the improvement of corrosion resistance of the longitudinal section in the second stage of cold drawing (epsilon=1.6) is due to the variation of misorientation angle distribution caused by the formation oftexture.
smart_material	this paper describes a study undertaken to determine the influence of variation in cement content on the mechanical properties and durability of nano silica concrete. a series of tests such as chloride diffusion tests and conventional scanning electron microscopy (sem) techniques are used to study micro structural features of concrete specimens contained nano particle of 1.5 percent of weight of cement. furthermore, compressive strength of specimens was also investigated. as the cement content has significant effect on the properties of concrete, the cement content is varied and test specimens are examined for nano silica concrete mixture with cement content of 350, 400 and 450 kg/m(3) respectively. test results indicate difference manner for nano specimen from those expected. increasing cement content, the compressive strength of nano specimens (like water absorption) increase to an optimal value; while chloride diffusion index reduces faster than reference specimens. sem observation shown that nano silica particles make the microstructure denser, on the other hand it produces more internal micro crack compare with reference concrete. although high pozolanic activity of nano silica improves the microstructure of the concrete, these speed up hydration and cause large pores area around the anhydrate cement particles.
solar_energy	this paper discusses the performance of a solar assisted ground source heat pump (sagshp) system used for storage of solar energy in day time and space heating at night. experiments were conducted to estimate the effectiveness of solar energy storage under the ground using a u-tube ground heat exchanger by absorbing solar energy from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and utilize the stored energy during space heating in the night time from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.. using the experimental data, heat absorbed by the solar collector, heat injected into the ground, heat extracted from the ground and cop of the system have been computed. results indicate that heat absorption by the solar collector varied from 2.07 to 2.56 kw with increase in mass flow rate. due to heat losses, only 1.991-2.414 kw of solar heat could be injected into the ground in the day time. increase in mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid in the collector and ground heat exchanger has resulted in 21% increase in heat injection into the ground. due to charging of ground, thermal energy of 2.8-3.2 times the work input to the solar collector could be extracted additionally from the ground in the night time for space heating. charging of ground has resulted in 23% increase in the cop of the system for space heating in the night time.(c) 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
suspension_bridge	in the last two decades, epoxy asphalt has seen its wide application as a bond coat and binder for an approximately 50 mm thick dense-graded epoxy asphalt concrete pavement on numerous orthotropic bridge steel decks around the world, particularly in east asia. bridges paved with this system include the sutong bridge, china 's longest main span cable-stayed bridge, the xihoumen bridge, china 's longest main span suspension bridge, and the new san francisco-oakland bay bridge in the united states. however, efforts have also been spent to take advantage of the unique properties of epoxy asphalt to solve several other difficult pavement challenges. some examples of these additional applications of epoxy asphalt include relatively thin dense-graded overlays on concrete bridge decks, durable open-graded surface mixtures on concrete bridge decks or roadways, and dense-graded mixtures for long-life roadway pavements. this paper describes problems faced and solved with epoxy asphalt surfacings on various projects other than the wide spread dense-graded wearing courses on orthotropic decks and discusses the potential application of epoxy asphalt in roadway pavements. published by elsevier ltd.
rainwater_harvesting	recently, rainwater harvesting systems have received increased attention due to their capability for adapting to water scarcity and climate change. however, a key obstacle to the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems is that they are often not financially feasible given difficulty in determining optimal system size. a key premise of previous studies was that all rainwater harvesting systems are constructed in a single construction event even though it is possible to construct a system in multiple stages. this assumption limits managerial flexibility in the construction of rainwater harvesting systems, which is particularly valuable in scenarios where it is difficult to forecast future rainfall patterns. therefore, we propose a multi-stage system expansion strategy for the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems using decommissioned septic tanks under scenarios of uncertainty in rainfall from a real option perspective as a means to improve the financial feasibility of implementing rainwater harvesting systems. we tested this strategy by evaluating a proposed rainwater harvesting system for a midsize apartment complex in jeonju, south korea. the multi-stage expansion strategy generated an option value of 9,896 usd. this study will help to improve the financial feasibility of rainwater harvesting systems by adding the value of managerial flexibility through a sequential expansion of rwh systems as new information becomes available.

smart_material	one of the pressing needs for the uv-vis is a design to allow even larger mirrors than the jwst primary at an affordable cost. we report here the results of a nasa innovative advanced concepts phase 1 study. our project is called a precise extremely large reflective telescope using reconfigurable elements (aperture). the idea is to deploy a continuous membrane-like mirror. the mirror figure will be corrected after deployment to bring it into better or equal lambda/20 deviations from the prescribed mirror shape. the basic concept is not new. what is new is to use a different approach from the classical piezoelectric-patch technology. instead, our concept is based on a contiguous coating of a so called magnetic smart material (msm). after deployment a magnetic write head will move on the non-reflecting side of the mirror and will generate a magnetic field that will produce a stress in the msm that will correct the mirror deviations from the prescribed shape.
smart_material	a magneto-rheological gel (mrg) is a kind of smart material fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic particles in high viscosity polymer gel. the internal particles of mrg are uniformly dispersed under off-state. while with the precondition of an external applied magnetic field, the particles will form a reversible chain-like structure, in which process the electrical resistivity of mrg has an immense change. in order to deeply understand the changing mechanism of the magneto-resistance of mrg, a theoretical model based on both the magnetic-dipole behavior and the percolation theory was proposed in this work. this model incorporates the parameters of the magnetic field intensity and carbonyl iron powder (cip) volume fraction. as a further effort to explore the magneto-resistance properties of mrg, a series of experimental testing were conducted. the magneto-resistance properties of mrg with different cip volume fractions and under different magnetic fields were investigated. the experimental results indicated that the conductivity of mrg was significantly increased with the increasing magnetic field and cip volume fraction. in addition, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical model, the experimental measured results and theoretically obtained results were compared. the validation results demonstrated that the theoretical model proposed in this work is capable of reproducing the field-dependent magneto-resistance properties of mrg.

rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting from roof is considered as valuable water resources. material flow analysis (mfa) of water in mahasarakham university (khamriang campus) shows that rainwater harvesting from roof can reduce water supply production by 7% and save more than 200,000 bt/year for water treatment cost. the sensitivity analysis suggests that by 5% water supply conservation and 20% additional rainwater harvesting, msu could have enough water resources. the rainwater is suitable to be substituted water for gardening due to the convenience to assemble an above ground storage tank or a pond to store harvested rainwater from roof. the current practice of rainwater is collected and discharged into drainage system and treated in wastewater treatment plant. utilisation of rainwater harvested could reduce wastewater amount that must be treated by 9%. rainwater harvesting and reuse should be promoted in campus in order to encourage sustainable living and water conservation policy.
suspension_bridge	cable-stayed suspension bridge is an unconventional bridge type with a bridge typology based on the combination of both cable-stayed and suspension systems. in this paper, the static behaviors of cable-stayed suspension bridge were revealed from the viewpoint of the structural deformational characteristics under different kinds of live loads. to more clearly illustrate these characteristics, the simplified analytical method based on the simplified analytical solutions for cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges were adopted in the derivations. furthermore, the simplified material cost model based on allowable stress method for cable-stayed suspension bridge was also proposed for researchers and designers to adopt in preliminary design stage.
smart_material	magnetorheological fluid (mrf) is a class of smart material whose acoustic properties can be varied rapidly and reversibly by the applied magnetic field. the mrf is proposed to be as actively sound barriers or acoustical metamaterial. this paper presents a theoretical model to study acoustic propagation in mrf under fields based on the biot-stoll model. the model considers the coupling interaction between ferro particle and base fluid. this paper investigated the acoustic velocity and attenuation of a commercial mrf dependence on the different parameters such as carrier fluid viscosity, permeability and intensity of magnetic field. the calculated results show that the attenuation is increased with small field strengths and independent on field strength when the magnetization begins to saturate.

geotextile	it is well-known that the performance of portland cement concrete (pcc) pavement depends, to a great extent, on the support condition under the slab. the texas department of transportation (txdot) recognized the importance of the support condition and requires the use of a stabilized base, either a 10.16-cm hot mix asphalt layer or a minimum 2.54-cm asphalt concrete over a 15.24-cm cement-stabilized layer. for pavement design purposes, 81.4 mpa/m has been used as the default value for the modulus of the subgrade reaction (k value) for the support provided by these bases. the use of a single value of 81.4 mpa/m for the k value in rigid pavement design was partly because of the insensitivity of the required slab thickness to the modulus of the subgrade reaction in the current txdot rigid pavement design procedure. to improve rigid pavement design, txdot developed a new design procedure for continuously reinforced concrete pavement (crcp) on the basis of mechanistic-empirical principles and plans to implement the procedure. in this design procedure, the slab support has rather more substantial effects on the required slab thickness than the current txdot design procedure. to increase the reliability of the new pavement design procedure, accurate evaluations of the k value are important. a test section was constructed in which various base types were used, and a number of field tests were conducted to estimate the range of k values for the support systems that are currently used or expected to be utilized, including the placement of nonwoven geotextile in lieu of the asphalt layer. the current practice of using one default value of 81.4 mpa/m needs to be revised, and the use of nonwoven geotextile is not recommended until further evaluations prove its viability.

smart_material	in this paper, the dynamic model of a shape memory alloy (sma) flexinol (tm) actuator wire is developed and simulated. the model is nonlinear with hysteresis behavior and its parameters are obtained easily using the manufacturer data sheet. the developed model can be served to investigate the sma behavior and to design control applications. the simulation results using ma tlab/ simulink verified the dynamic model behavior and affirmed the potential of the modeling procedure. the results showed that the flexinol (tm) wire is a powerful actuator with large strain up to 5% and high power to weight ratio.
water_pollution	the aim of this study was to investigate the overall root/shoot allocation of metal contaminants, the amount of metal removal by absorption and adsorption within or on the external root surfaces, the dose-response of water hyacinth metal uptake, and phytotoxicity. this was examined in a single-metal tub trial, using arsenic (as), gold (au), copper (cu), iron (fe), mercury (hg), manganese (mn), uranium (u), and zinc (zn). iron and mn were also used in low-, medium-, and high-concentration treatments to test their dose effect on water hyacinth 's metal uptake. water hyacinth was generally tolerant to metallotoxicity, except for cu and hg. over 80 % of the total amount of metals removed was accumulated in the roots, of which 30-52 % was adsorbed onto the root surfaces. furthermore, 73-98 % of the total metal assimilation by water hyacinth was located in the roots. the bioconcentration factor (bcf) of cu, hg, au, and zn exceeded the recommended index of 1000, which is used in selection of phytoremediating plants, but those of u, as, and mn did not. nevertheless, the bcf for mn increased with the increase of mn concentration in water. this suggests that the use of bcf index alone, without the consideration of plant biomass and metal concentration in water, is inadequate to determine the potential of plants for phytoremediation accurately. thus, this study confirms that water hyacinth holds potential for a broad spectrum of phytoremediation roles. however, knowing whether these metals are adsorbed on or assimilated within the plant tissues as well as knowing their allocation between roots and shoots will inform decisions how to re-treat biomass for metal recovery, or the mode of biomass reduction for safe disposal after phytoremediation.
remote_sensing	wind power is a clean and renewable resource, and it is rapidly becoming an important component of sustainable development and resource transfer. however, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. in this study, we verified whether china 's gf-2 hd satellite (gf-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in jiuquan city, gansu province. monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the landsat 8 oli and china 's gf-1 hd satellite (gf-1). we performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. we evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km(2) per device. the construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m(2) of grassland. the average area of grassland damaged by 3 mw and 1.5 mw turbines was 5757 m(2) and 2496 m(2), respectively. approximately 2.44 km(2) of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. the average difference between the measured and calculated gf-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and gf-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. in addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed. in this study, grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development.

stealth_technology	this paper mainly focuses on the conceptual design and stealth performance of the three-surface military aircraft. a three-dimensional (3-d) digital mock-up of the three-surface strike fighter with stealth feature was designed and the schemes of carrying missiles were analyzed in catia. based on physical optics principle and the method of equivalent currents (mec), a numerical simulation of the rcs feature of the aircraft was carried out with rcsplus which is a software designed by beihang university. the paper contributes to the rcs feature analysis of the whole plane and different parts on x-band, s-hand and band and a comparison of rcs feature to su-37 and t-50 military aircraft is drawn. on x-band, the pitch angle of the incident wave was 0 degrees, and the result shows: (1) compared with su-37 aircraft, the forward scattering rcs of the three-surface strike aircraft was reduced to 14.9%, the side scattering rcs to 9.6% and the back scattering rcs to 40.2%. (2) compared with t-50 aircraft, the forward scattering rcs was reduced to 38.61%, and the side scattering rcs to 67.26%. this paper should he useful for researchers in conceptual design and stealth technology of the military aircraft.
smart_material	the elaboration of smart materials with optical fiber sensors embedded into several dissimilar layers is capable of monitoring various system parameters inside the layered structure without damaging the host structure itself. this work mainly concentrates on the thermal elaboration process used to embed optical fibers into ceramic coating layers and their characterization. a new mechanical holder is first proposed in order to maintain the optical fiber during the thermal spray process and protect it from the strong atmospheric turbulence caused by the heat flux. wire flame thermal spray where particles are propelled on the substrate at a temperature of more than 2000 degrees c is chosen as the elaboration process and the favorable elaboration conditions are evaluated. the microscopic characteristics of both the surface and cross-section of the embedding structure are evaluated, and the mechanical adhesion strength of the embedded optical fiber is then measured and discussed. the results show that the optical fiber remains undamaged after the thermal spray process and keeps perfect adhesion with the ceramic coating, making the former a competitive method to elaborate the embedded hybrid structure.

green_building	in recent years, china has been gradually consolidating the establishment of low carbon communities (lcc) to minimize the emission of co2 and other greenhouse gasses. guangdong province, as one of the low-carbon pilot provinces, has also paid great attention to the building of lcc. however, currently guangdong province, or even china as a whole, has no official evaluation system in place which can be employed to evaluate the degree of low carbon of urban lcc. this paper aimed to establish a system for evaluating the urban lcc of guangdong province based on their actual situations. the system divided the evaluation into six categories, applied the smart criteria to select suitable indices, and set the reference values for two zones, i.e., the pearl river delta zone (prd) and the non-prd zone. monte carlo and ahp were combined for the calculation of index weights, thus ensuring that the weight judgment matrixes could all pass the consistency check. in addition, this paper also laid down detailed evaluation regulations to improve the operability of this system and guarantee its wide application and better generalization. finally, one typical urban community was selected to test the operability of this system, and the one at -a-time (oat) method was used to analyze the sensitivity of each index and explore the degree of influence of these indices on evaluation results. the results showed that three indicators corresponding to green building percentage, new energy vehicles percentage and low carbon public transportation had the highest sensitivity. after field test evaluation, the evaluation system was found to have strong operability, and a high accessibility to indicator data. this system cannot only be used as a tool by the provincial people 's government of guangdong to evaluate the construction progress and degree of low carbon in lcc, but can also provide a reference point and experience for the chinese government to draw upon in establishing the evaluation system of lcc at a national level.

rainwater_harvesting	the management of water resources during the dry season is a major challenge associated with rainwater harvesting (rwh) technology, but is necessary given the human suffering that follows from resulting conditions of water scarcity. in this study, the parameters for dry season assessment are defined in terms of 'no water days' (nwd) and rainwater usage ratio. a simple socio-technical operational strategy making use of a water level monitoring system is proposed for nwd reduction. this involves water level monitoring, whereby daily water demand varies with user cooperation, as based on the available water in a tank. the results of our study show that an nwd as low as 10 can be achieved as compared with the current value of 115 days, before considering investment on additional roof catchments and tank volume. these parameters are useful for analyzing any type of rooftop rwh system. furthermore, this operational strategy can be made practical and simplified by incorporating an easily visible and understood guideline onto the rwh system. this strategy is replicable anywhere in the world, with consideration of site-specific conditions such as rainfall amounts, roof sizes, and population.
green_building	there are limited data on air quality parameters, including airborne particulate matter (pm) in residential green buildings, which are increasing in prevalence. exposure to pm is associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and since americans spend almost 90% of their time indoors, residential exposures may substantially contribute to overall airborne pm exposure. our objectives were to: (1) measure various pm fractions longitudinally in apartments in multi-family green buildings with natural (building e) and mechanical (building l) ventilation; (2) compare indoor and outdoor pm mass concentrations and their ratios (i/o) in these buildings, taking into account the effects of occupant behavior; and (3) evaluate the effect of green building designs and operations on indoor pm. we evaluated effects of ventilation, occupant behaviors, and overall building design on pm mass concentrations and i/o. median pmtotal was higher in building e (56 mu g/m(3)) than in building l (37 mu g/m(3)); i/o was higher in building e (1.3-2.0) than in building l (0.5-0.8) for all particle size fractions. our data show that the building design and occupant behaviors that either produce or dilute indoor pm (e.g., ventilation systems, combustion sources, and window operation) are important factors affecting residents' exposure to pm in residential green buildings.
remote_sensing	atmospheric water vapor plays an important role in hydrologic cycle and climate change of the earth. a number of studies have focused on retrieval of the total precipitable water (tpw) using microwave or optical remote sensing. in this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded tpw over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter delta tb-18.7/delta tb-23.8 based on the combination of amsr-e and modis observations. there are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity delta epsilon(18.7)/delta epsilon(23.8) and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of tpw using dem. to obtain a high resolution tpw, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded tpw to a fine scale of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees using dem and ndvi. in addition, the downscaled tpw was further calibrated using high precision tpw from modis in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded tpw were validated against suominet gps retrieved tpw on a global scale. the rmse for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global tpw is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. in addition, the rmse for the downscaled 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded global tpw is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. an obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with modis tpw product is that it can retrieve tpw under cloudy sky condition over land. the algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to amsr2 on board gcom-w1 and provides the long-term global daily tpw over land since the launch of aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies.

suspension_bridge	the wake oscillator model is considered to be the most proper semi-empirical model for qualitatively or even quantitively assessing the vortex-induced vibration of a structure in the design stage. however, the complexities in parameter determination limit its usage in real engineering fields. moreover, this kind of model is traditionally used to describe the experimental phenomena of two-dimensional cross-section models, the gaps between the results of two-dimensional cross-section model tests and the prototype responses of the three-dimensional real structures should be filled up. in this paper, a detailed study of the wake oscillator model is firstly presented, which demonstrates the influences of model parameters on the viv features described by the wake oscillator model. then, a new method for conveniently identifying the model parameters in the wake oscillator model is proposed. besides, a new procedure, based on the wake oscillator model, for interpreting the wind tunnel test results into real structures is also proposed. the results are validated by wind tunnel tests and compared with field measurements.

remote_sensing	the nasa soil moisture active passive (smap) satellite mission was launched on january 31, 2015 to provide global mapping of high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw state every 2-3 days using an l-band (active) radar and an l-band (passive) radiometer. the level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product (l2_sm_p) provides soil moisture estimates posted on a 36-km earth-fixed grid using brightness temperature observations from descending passes. this paper provides the first comparison of the validated-release l2_sm_p product with soil moisture products provided by the soil moisture and ocean salinity (smos), aquarius, advanced scatterometer (ascat), and advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (amsr2) missions. this comparison was conducted as part of the smap calibration and validation efforts. smap and smos appear most similar among the five soil moisture products considered in this paper, overall exhibiting the smallest unbiased root-mean-square difference and highest correlation. overall, smos tends to be slightly wetter than smap, excluding forests where some differences are observed. smap and aquarius can only be compared for a little more than two months; they compare well, especially over low to moderately vegetated areas. smap and ascat show similar overall trends and spatial patterns with ascat providing wetter soil moistures than smap over moderate to dense vegetation. smap and amsr2 largely disagree in their soil moisture trends and spatial patterns; amsr2 exhibits an overall dry bias, while desert areas are observed to be wetter than smap.
solar_energy	it has been well documented that population growth, development of biological subsystems and the utilization of resources in ecology and economy frequently follow a logistic or sigmoid time-development. in the context of oil and gas extraction such development is known as hubbert 's peak oil theory. we observe that the logistic equation describes the historic development of nuclear and hydroelectric energy production as well. previous studies have hypothesized that the present time fastest growing renewable technologies, wind and solar energy, will develop under similar constraints. here, we provide evidence that the installation of these technologies follow a logistic curve. in contrast to what is commonly perceived, the specific growth rate in energy extraction from wind turbines and photovoltaics have decreased in recent years. in an optimistic scenario, where we have included forecasted data from the solar and wind associations four years into the future, the logistic model implies that the total installed capacity saturates at around 1.8 tw in 2030. this is in sharp contrast to the almost established belief that these energy technologies will experience an exponential growth far into this century.
rainwater_harvesting	urban rainwater reuse preserves water resources and promotes sustainable development in rapidly growing urban areas. the efficiency of a large number of urban water reuse systems, operating under different climate and demand conditions, is evaluated here on the base of a new risk analysis approach. results obtained by probability analysis (pa) indicate that maximum efficiency in low demanding scenarios is above 0.5 and a threshold, distinguishing low from high demanding scenarios, indicates that in low demanding scenarios no significant improvement in performance may be attained by increasing the storage capacity of rainwater harvesting tanks. threshold behaviour is displayed when tank storage capacity is designed to match both the average collected volume and the average reuse volume. the low demand limit cannot be achieved under climate and operating conditions characterized by a disproportion between harvesting and demand volume.
green_building	the principal aims of this paper are; (1) to determine the rate of depreciation for certified green and conventional purpose-built office (pbo) and; (2) to assess the relationship between building categories and green building classifications toward influencing the rental depreciation of pbo buildings. using cross sectional survey of twenty-seven buildings in golden triangle area of kuala lumpur, the data collected were analysed using frequency and descriptive statistics to establish the rate of depreciation for green and conventional pbo buildings. furthermore, the correlation and regression techniques were used to assess the significance of building categories and classifications in influencing the rental depreciation of pbo buildings. this study successfully identifies the average rate of depreciation within the dataset, with 46.77 percent. in comparison of average depreciation rate between green office buildings and conventional, the rate was observed higher in conventional class as to contrast with green class pbo buildings. results from the correlation analysis explain the age, building categories and classifications were strongly correlated to the rental depreciation. lastly, regression results evidenced the building categories and classifications significantly predict the rental depreciation model in 2014.

ambient_intelligence	ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) is a term used for human interaction with computers in virtually everything we do and almost everywhere we go. it is embedding computers in our daily lives to create an active and intelligent environment [1]. this is future phase of computers, which is beyond the desktop and notebook environment, where we are currently in and we are progressively heading deeper inside this new phase. in ubiquitous computing we mainly focus on computer being integral part of human such that we are unaware of their presence. computer scientists are focusing hard on ways how the interaction between human and computer can be simplified. we can think of an era where we are surrounded with over hundreds of computers each doing a unique task irrespective of location and time and keeping human unaware. in this article we explore about the evolution of ubiquitous computing from its origin and history, its architecture, role of privacy and integration of privacy in system design, its features and technical challenges. ubiquitous computing is the third wave in computing, which has begun just now. ubicomp is a field where we require considerable efforts to match up the current technological developments. according to the view of computer scientists and engineers in future we will be having such a technological advancement in this field that will amaze the world.
suspension_bridge	this paper describes selected results collected during the wind tunnel tests carried out at politecnico di milano wind tunnel on the deck sectional model of the messina strait bridge. it is a long span suspension bridge characterized by a multi box deck. aerodynamic forces and surface pressure distributions have been measured in order to characterize static and dynamic response of the deck. vortex induced vibrations phenomenon has been studied with particular attention: it represents one of the most important aspects to be considered while designing the deck shape of long span bridges and it has to be carefully analyzed. in fact, even if it can be separated from the stability problem for the modern bridges, viv, in case of low scruton numbers, can lead the deck to reach very large vibration amplitudes, also at very low wind speeds.

remote_sensing	ecological vulnerability assessment is a key approach to adaptation to and mitigation of environmental degradation. to assess the ecological vulnerability of yinma river basin in cold mountain region of china, the ecological vulnerability index (evi) model was established based on the integrated system dynamic (sd) model and driving force-pressure-state-impact-response-management (dpsirm) framework. using multi-sources data including meteorological, remote sensing, basic geographical, sample and socio-economic data, the values of evi were calculated. the assessment results indicated that the overall ecosystem vulnerability conditions in the study area experienced a degenerating trend. the extremely, heavily and moderately vulnerable zones were mainly distributed in the north-central and southwest parts of the basin. the slightly and lightly vulnerable areas were distributed in the southeast part of the basin. for the distribution of ecological vulnerability grades, in administrative regions, the high rate of slightly vulnerable level and light vulnerable level appeared in shuangyang district and panshi city while the largest area rate of moderately, heavily and extremely vulnerable level were distributed in dehui city, nongan county, jiutai district and yitong county. the study demonstrated that the sd model could efficiently reflect the dynamic mechanism of the basin ecological vulnerability and the results gained closely reflected the reality of the study area.

smart_material	we report on a multifunctional four-finger gripper for soft robotics, suitable for performing delicate manipulation tasks. the gripping device is comprised of separately driven gripping and lifting mechanisms, both made from a separate single piece of smart material-ionic capacitive laminate (icl) also known as artificial muscle. compared to other similar devices the relatively high force output of the icl material allows one to construct a device able to grab and lift objects exceeding multiple times its own weight. due to flexible design of icl grips, the device is able to adapt the complex shapes of different objects and allows grasping single or multiple objects simultaneously without damage. the performance of the gripper is evaluated in two different configurations: a) the ultimate grasping strength of the gripping hand; and b) the maximum lifting force of the lifting actuator. the icl is composed of three main layers: a porous membrane consisting of non-ionic polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (pvdf-hfp), ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethane-sulfonate (emitfs), and a reinforcing layer of woven fiberglass cloth. both sides of the membrane are coated with a carbonaceous electrode. the electrodes are additionally covered with thin gold layers, serving as current collectors. device made of this material operates silently, requires low driving voltage (<3 v), and is suitable for performing tasks in open air environment.
water_pollution	the influence of wind and hydrodynamic processes on the spreading of turbid waters from the vistula lagoon into the baltic sea was studied. our research is based on joint analyses of remote sensing data and those from concurrent in situ measurements of the three-dimensional structure of the outflow. a strong difference in the water optical properties of the baltic sea and the vistula lagoon caused by an intense summer bloom of cyanobacteria allowed studies of the evolution and transformation of the outflow in mid-july-early august 2014 using ocean color satellite data. our in situ measurements revealed that waters from the vistula lagoon were exclusively present in the upper water layer. the study was conducted under various wind and, therefore, under different upwelling/downwelling conditions, thereby determining different patterns of wind-driven currents, which enabled us to assess their impact on the propagation of the lagoon outflow. one of these patterns was reaching to the south, along the vistula spit, and another one reaching to the north, along the sambia peninsula. we show that the main spreading direction of the plume strongly coincides with that of wind-driven currents. however, if vortical structures are present in the bay of gdansk, they also affect the plume transformation, and that should be taken into account when the propagation of water pollution is forecasted.
suspension_bridge	two nonlinear analysis methods are newly presented for finding the initial shape of suspension bridges under dead load. for this, the extended tangential stiffness matrices of the nonlinear frame element as well as the elastic catenary cable element are derived by adding unstrained element lengths to the unknown. a g.tcud (generalized target configuration under dead loads) method and an unstrained element length method are then proposed to get the minimized bending moment as well as to remove both lateral and axial deformations in the main girder and the tower. finally the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed schemes are demonstrated through two numerical examples.

suspension_bridge	in this study, a railway suspension bridge is modeled as a suspended beam and the train over it as a sequence of moving sprung masses. to investigate the bridge response subjected to simultaneous actions of moving load and earthquake-induced support motions, the total response of the suspended beam under ground motions can be decomposed into two parts: the pseudo-static response and the inertia-dynamic component, in which the pseudostatic displacement is analytically obtained by exerting the support movements on the suspended beam statically and the governing equations in terms of the inertia-dynamic component as well as moving oscillators are transformed into a set of nonlinearly coupled generalized equations by galerkin 's method. when conducting the dynamic response analysis of a suspended beam subject to moving vehicles and multiple support excitations, one needs to deal with nonlinear coupling vibration problems with time-dependent boundary conditions. instead of solving the coupled equations for the inertia-dynamic generalized system containing pseudo-static support excitations and moving oscillators, this study treats all the nonlinear coupled terms as pseudo forces, and then solves the decoupled equations using newmark 's beta method with an incremental-iterative approach that can take all the nonlinear coupling effects into account. numerical investigations demonstrate that the present solution technique is available in conducting the dynamic interaction problem with support excitations. moreover, non-uniform seismic inputs may amplify the both responses of the suspended beam and moving vehicles over it significantly. such an effect is often neglected by the assumption of uniform seismic ground motions in conventional design of bridge structures.
green_building	the purpose of this paper is to analyze the construction model of urban fanning on vertical building envelopes to support the green building development in sleman regency, special district yogyakarta province, indonesia. the construction of vertical buildings in sleman district is growing rapidly together with the increasing demand for the provision of housing and public facilities. the rapid physical development in sleman has caused the reduction of green land such as green open space (rth), agricultural land and rice fields. these developments potentially threaten food security in sleman district. urban farming is a method of agricultural activities to reduce the problems of agricultural land limitation in urban areas, like sleman district. the construction design model of urban farming on the vertical building envelope is one aspect of green building that will support the efforts in vertical farming processes. this showed that the method did not require any horizontally ground space but effectively used the vertical space on the building envelope, including wall and building roof features and construction. in fact, the urban farming construction method will not only contribute to productive agricultural activities, but also support the greening of the urban area as well as reduce the crisis of agricultural land issues. the urban farming construction model of the vertical building facade includes the urban farming construction on the roof, wall, and balcony.

water_pollution	the hashemite kingdom of jordan is an example of a country that suffers from high water scarcity. additionally, due to the economic drivers in the country, such as phosphate and potash extraction and pharmaceutical production, the little fresh water that remains is generally polluted. the infrastructure, often antiquated in urban areas and non-existent in rural areas, also contributes to poor water conditions and to the spread of waterborne diseases. this paper examines the socioeconomic factors that contribute to diarrhea and hepatitis a on a macro level in jordan and discusses the public-policies that government officials could use to abate those problems. ordinary least squares time series models are used to understand the macro-level variables that impact the incidence of these diseases in jordan. public health expenditure has a significant impact on reducing their incidence. furthermore, investment in sanitation facilities in rural regions is likely to reduce the number of cases of hepatitis a. perhaps the most surprising outcome is that importation of goods and services likely results in a decrease in cases of hepatitis a. however, income has little impact on the incidence of diarrhea and hepatitis a.
solar_energy	solar steam generation is a highly promising technology for harvesting solar energy, desalination and water purification. we introduce a novel bilayered structure composed of wood and graphene oxide (go) for highly efficient solar steam generation. the go layer deposited on the microporous wood provides broad optical absorption and high photothermal conversion resulting in rapid increase in the temperature at the liquid surface. on the other hand, wood serves as a thermal insulator to confine the photothermal heat to the evaporative surface and to facilitate the efficient transport of water from the bulk to the photothermally active space. owing to the tailored bilayer structure and the optimal thermo-optical properties of the individual components, the wood go composite structure exhibited a solar thermal efficiency of similar to 83% under simulated solar excitation at a power density of 12 kw/m(2). the novel composite structure demonstrated here is highly scalable and cost-efficient, making it an attractive material for various applications involving large light absorption, photothermal conversion and heat localization.

stealth_technology	strong interest in radar absorbing materials (rams) took place with years due to their extensive sectors of application. rams are coatings whose electric and magnetic properties allow the absorption of microwave energy over certain frequencies. in particular, rams are very effective means of radar cross section (rcs) reduction in the context of stealth technology. rcs reduction requires absorbers with broad-band characteristics since surveillance radars often employ wide bandwidths. carbon fiber reinforced plastic (cfrp) composites are made of short carbon fibers embedded in a polymer matrix. they allow broad-band radar absorbing materials (rams) characterized by low reflection coefficient against impinging electromagnetic fields, and high resistance against environmental hazards.
solar_energy	the integration of solar energy in the electricity market faces some challenges related to the time-varying nature of energy coming from the sun. the use of energy storage emerges as a technological solution to these problems and opens new possibilities for the integration of photovoltaic (pv) plants in the electrical market. this paper addresses the problem of integration of pv plants in the electricity market, providing a solution for an optimal scheduling, which allows the plant to participate in the daily and intraday markets. in order to perform a proper scheduling, a good estimation of energy prices is of paramount importance. the paper proposes also a price forecast algorithm that provides prices in a one-day horizon, based on price historical data and meteorological information. the development of the scheduling strategy is carried out using model predictive control (mpc) and taking into account operational constraints. the mpc techniques allow maximizing the economic benefit of the pv plant manipulating the energy stored and extracted from the batteries. some results of the application of the price forecasting approach and the scheduling strategy to a simulated pv plant located in seville (spain) are presented. the weather data and electricity prices are publicly available, supplied by the spanish system operator.

remote_sensing	for river water quality monitoring at 30m x 1-day spatio-temporal scales, a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (starfm) is developed for estimating turbidity (t-u), total suspended solid (tss), and six heavy metals (hv) of iron, zinc, copper, chromium, lead and cadmium, by blending the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) and landsat (l-s) spectral bands. a combination of regression analysis and genetic algorithm (ga) techniques are applied to develop spectral relationships between tu-l5, tss-t,, and each hv-tss. the starfm algorithm and all the developed relationship models are evaluated satisfactorily by various performance evaluation measures to develop heavy metal pollution index-based vulnerability maps at 1-km resolution in the brahmani river in eastern india. the monte-carlo simulation based analysis of the developed formulations reveals that the uncertainty in estimating zn and cd is the minimum (1.04%) and the maximum (5.05%), respectively. hence, the remote sensing based approach developed herein can effectively be used in many world rivers for real-time monitoring of heavy metal pollution.

solar_energy	the asphalt pavement heated by solar has attracted great attentions in heating urban cities, so-called urban heat island (uhi). in fact, the solar energy heating asphalt pavements also has potential ability to bring out geological disasters in permafrost, e.g., qinghai-tibet plateau (qtp). this study designed a special solar heating reflective coating layer (shrcl) in order to cool the asphalt pavement surface. the cooling performance of shrcls was studied by comparing the temperatures of normal pavements and shrcls. the result indicated that shrcl could work as expected resulting in reducing around 10 degrees c compared to the normal pavement, no matter on the top or on the bottom. the temperature difference between the top and the bottom was about 5 degrees c, not only in shrcls but also in normal pavements, less linking with coating or un-coating. the field testing result agrees very well with the laboratory study. to enhance the skid resistance of shrcls, sands were added into coatings without influencing the cooling performance, but reducing the abrasive resistance. accelerated pavement testing (apt) was employed to evaluate the engineering performance of shrcl. it is suggested that inhomogeneous deformation, e.g., rutting, will bring cracking and spalling between asphalt pavement surfaces and coating layers.

rainwater_harvesting	this article examines the formalization of rainwater harvesting (rwh) and the implications of new policy trends for water governance. analysis of 96 rwh policies across the united states indicates three trends: (1) the 'codification' of water through administrative rather than public law; (2) the institutionalization of rwh through market-based tools; and (3) the rise of policies at different spatial scales, resulting in greater institutional complexity, new bureaucratic actors, and potential points of friction. drawing on the cases of colorado and texas, the article argues that states with diverse legal traditions of water enable more successful regulatory environments for downspout alternatives.

water_pollution	water plays an important role in human civilisation. since ancient times people started to settle in regions with ensured water availability. trade was an important factor for the development of civilisation. silk road is an important route used for the trading between china and other countries across eurasia. not only silk, many goods including leather were exchanged during trading. leather was processing lead to release of large amount of wastewater. this study was carried out to understand how the leather processing would have affected the groundwater quality in silk road sites by studying the current scenarios of groundwater quality near tanning industries. chennai and nearby cities such as ranipet and vaniyambadi are chosen for case studies. groundwater quality around the tanneries was poor due to high electrical conductivity and concentration of chromium. this is due to the effluents released by the tanneries into the ground or open drains without proper treatment. similarly, the leather processing in silk road sites would have also affected the groundwater quality.
solar_energy	due to the intermittent nature of solar energy, there is a need to store heat to meet the needs when solar light is not available. rock bed using air as heat transfer fluid (htf) is being now used for thermal energy storage (tes) in concentrated solar power (csp) plants. it is considered as a cost effective storage system. however, no detailed works have been published on selection and identification of rocks for high temperature storage applications. the scope of the present study is to choose the most suitable rocks for high temperature sensible heat storage (shs) using a methodology based on laboratory measurements. thus, experimental characterization of several rock types has been performed. an experimental device has been made for thermal conductivity measurement at room temperature. the obtained results show that the gabbro rock is the best candidate material for csp plants. comparative study with some other conventional materials found in literature indicates that rock is an efficient filler material for high temperature tes. from the obtained results and correlations, a second selection methodology has been proposed in order to minimize the steps of selection using simple and few tests.

solar_energy	z-scheme water splitting is a promising approach based on high-performance photocatalysis by harvesting broadband solar energy. its efficiency depends on the well-defined interfaces between two semiconductors for the charge kinetics and their exposed surfaces for chemical reactions. herein, we report a facile cation-exchange approach to obtain compounds with both properties without the need for noble metals by forming janus-like structures consisting of gamma-mns and cu7s4 with high-quality interfaces. the janus-like gamma-mns/cu7s4 structures displayed dramatically enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of up to 718 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under full-spectrum irradiation. upon further integration with an mnox oxygen-evolution cocatalyst, overall water splitting was accomplished with the janus structures. this work provides insight into the surface and interface design of hybrid photocatalysts, and offers a noble-metal-free approach to broadband photocatalytic hydrogen production.
ambient_intelligence	with the ever-growing prevalence of dementia, nursing costs are increasing, while the ability to live independently vanishes. dem@home is an ambient assisted living framework to support independent living while receiving intelligent clinical care. dem@home integrates a variety of ambient and wearable sensors together with sophisticated, interdisciplinary methods of image and semantic analysis. semantic web technologies, such as owl 2, are extensively employed to represent sensor observations and application domain specifics as well as to implement hybrid activity recognition and problem detection. complete with tailored user interfaces, clinicians are provided with accurate monitoring of multiple life aspects, such as physical activity, sleep, complex daily tasks and clinical problems, leading to adaptive non-pharmaceutical interventions. the method has been already validated for both recognition performance and improvement on a clinical level, in four home pilots.
suspension_bridge	in this paper, three dynamic linear models of the main span of suspension bridges are studied. the models describe vertical and torsional oscillations of the deck under the action of lateral wind. the problems correspond to the situations when both the midspan cable bands are loosened, both the midspan bands are fixed, and one midspan band is fixed and the other is loosened. three corresponding eigenvalue and eigenvector problems are formulated and analysed. the continuous dependence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors on data are proved. the analysis of the three eigenvalue and eigenvector problems against flutter is carried out, which reveals possible reasons of the collapse of the original tacoma suspension bridge.
suspension_bridge	we study periodic solutions of the suspension bridge model proposed by lazer and mckenna with a periodic damping term. under the dolph-type condition and a small periodic damping term condition, the existence and the uniqueness of a periodic solution have been proved by a constructive method. two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of the periodic damping term.
ambient_intelligence	as the research in ambient assisted living (aal) matures, we expect that data generated from aal iot devices will benefit from analysis by well established machine learning techniques. there is also potential that new research in ml and artificial intelligence (ai) can be used on data generated from the sensors used in aal. in this paper we present a survey of the research in the related topics, identify its shortcomings and propose future work that will integrate these fields by collecting ambient sensor data and process the data by ml framework which can detect and classify activities.
construction_management	currently many university programs in the construction field do not take sustainability into account from a holistic viewpoint. this may cause a lack of sensitivity from future professionals concerning sustain ability. academics in construction must endeavor to instill a culture of sustainability in the curricula of their students. therefore, this study proposes an active-learning method that allows graduate students in the construction field to take into consideration infrastructure sustainability from a variety of perspectives in a participatory process. the students applied an analytical hierarchical process to determine the appraisal degree of each criterion. a cluster statistical analysis was carried out, aiming to identify the profiles that influence decision-making. this method was applied to two classes of graduate students enrolled in the master of planning and management in civil engineering at the universitat politecnica de valencia. this method identified a correlation between the profiles toward sustainability and the characteristics of the chosen infrastructure. it was also found that the method fulfills educational purposes: most of the students obtained more than 65% of the target learning outcomes. this approach promotes awareness and sensitivity to different points of view of the sustainability in a participatory context. it can be replicated in other contexts so as to obtain appraisals regarding various criteria that help enhance decision-making.

green_building	several frameworks incorporate social and psychological elements of environmentally significant behaviour, and most assume cognitive and deliberate decision-making. household energy consumption behaviours, however, span a spectrum from reasoned and deliberate to unplanned and automatic. the aim of this paper is to advance knowledge of reasoned and unplanned behaviours in the context of pro-environmental action. using results of a survey administered to occupants of an urban residential green building, this study explores five household consumption behaviours and tests the hypothesis that unplanned behaviours will be poorly predicted by a reasoned, values-based behavioural framework. using path analyses, variables in a values-based framework are used to predict surveyed behaviours. findings indicate that behaviours hypothesized to be unplanned were not well predicted by the values-based framework. the framework successfully predicted what was hypothesized to be a fully reasoned behaviour. three potential reasons are discussed for the lack of prediction of some behaviours. a deeper understanding of how unplanned, automatic or habitual behaviours intervene in conservation intentions can help policy-makers and building designers better respond to influences of occupant behaviour on building performance.
water_pollution	non-point source water pollution mainly comes from farmland chemical fertilizers which has become an obstacle of agricultural sustainability and ecological health. as a public policy tool for assessing global ecological crisis and environmental pollution, ecological compensation is important for regional agricultural sustainability. ecological compensation that farmers receive from governments is based on their reduction of fertilizer application at optimal ecological and economic levels. in this study we estimated the ecological compensation standards for nitrogen non-point pollution in yixng city with contingent valuation method and cost-benefit method. results showed that the range of theoretical values of ecological compensation of nitrogen in yixing city depended upon its optimal ecological and economic nitrogen application levels. the willingness of farmers to accept the compensation was positively correlated with their farming experience and education. there were about half of farmers willing to accept the compensation. based on the present study, we found yixing 's ecological compensation standard for controlling nitrogen non-point pollution was 620.0 yuan/hm(2) at the current economic development level.
water_pollution	recently, the relationship between carbon dioxide emission (co2), aggregate energy consumption (ec) and economic growth (gdp) has been widely studied by many researchers using different approaches but the results were conflicting. such controversy may due to the efficiency of the applied statistical approaches and using different dataset. the main objective of this experimental study is to examine the relationship between co2, ec, and gdp using different data transformation forms (natural logarithm versus inverse form) in reducing the heteroscedasticity in panel data. the panel data consist of 29 countries from two different economic levels of countries, 17 developed versus 12 developing countries. the data spanning from 1960 to 2008. a panel data approach is applied and estimations based on three models. first of all, the estimations are conducted by constructing three different models; first model is estimated by using the original data without any transformation, while the second and third model use the natural logarithm (log) and inverse form to transform the data. those two transformation forms are applied to reduce the heteroscedasticity problem. the main findings show a strong relationship between the three variables. the model with inverse function transformation is superior to the other two models using original data and log transformation, as it has the highest r-2 which illustrates that more than 84% of co2 emission can be explained by gdp and ec. since ec and gdp are influential on the co2 emissions, higher ec and lower gdp may lead to environmental problems such as air and water pollution. therefore, prevention action should be taken to minimize the environmental degradation.
green_building	designing environmentally friendly buildings that provide both high performance and cost savings is of increasing interest in the development of sustainable cities. today, we are looking at not just buildings' certification but sustainable practices that go beyond ratings to satisfy our social responsibilities. the construction industry in general will benefit from an integrated tool that will help optimize the selection process of materials, equipments, and systems at every stage of a proposed building 's life. building information modeling (bim) has the potential to aid designers to select the right type of materials during the early design stage and to make vital decisions that have great impacts on the life cycle of sustainable buildings. this paper describes a methodology that integrates bim with the canadian green building certification system (leed(c)). also, it explains how this integration would assist project teams in making sustainability related decisions while accumulating the required number of points based on the applied green building rating system. the methodology depicts the implementation of a model that automatically calculates the compiled number of leed certification points and related registration costs for green and certified materials used in designing sustainable buildings all within the concepts of bim. using bim in this methodology will help designers to invent and animate sustainable buildings in 3d mode easily and efficiently at the conceptual stage. the design information of the proposed sustainable building will be produced in a timely manner by using new plug-ins, which are developed for that reason, and which will link the bim model with an external database that stores sustainable materials and assembly groups. a real case project is presented to illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the proposed model.

solar_energy	a new approach for solar electricity generation and storage is proposed, based on the concept of thermally regenerative batteries. concentrated sunlight is used for external thermo-chemical charging of a flow battery, and electricity is produced by conventional electro-chemical discharge of the battery. the battery replaces the steam turbine, currently used in commercial concentrated solar power (csp) plants, potentially leading to much higher conversion efficiency. this approach offers potential performance, cost and operational advantages compared to existing solar technologies, and to existing storage solutions for management of an electrical grid with a significant contribution of intermittent solar electricity generation. here we analyze the theoretical conversion efficiency for new thermo-electro-chemical storage (tecs) plant schemes based on the electro-chemical systems of sodium-sulfur (na-s) and zinc-air. the thermodynamic upper limit of solar to electricity conversion efficiency for an ideal tecs cycle is about 60% for na-s at reactor temperature of 1550 k, and 65% for the zinc-air system at 1750 k, both under sunlight concentration of 3000. a hybrid process with carbothermic reduction in the zinc-air system reaches 60% theoretical efficiency at the more practical conditions of reaction temperature <1200 k and concentration <1000. practical tecs plant efficiency, estimated from these upper limits, may then be much higher compared to existing solar electricity technologies. the technical and economical feasibility of the proposed cycle are also discussed.

ambient_intelligence	analysis and detection of human behaviors from video sequences has became recently a very hot research topic in computer vision and artificial intelligence. indeed, human behavior understanding plays a fundamental role in several innovative application domains such as smart video surveillance, ambient intelligence and content-based video information retrieval. however, the uncertainty and vagueness that typically characterize human daily activities make frameworks for human behavior analysis (hba) hard to design and develop. in order to bridge this gap, this paper proposes a hierarchical architecture, based on a tracking algorithm, time-delay neural networks and fuzzy inference systems, aimed at improving the performance of current mba systems in terms of scalability, robustness and effectiveness in behavior detection. precisely, the joint use of the aforementioned methodologies enables both a quantitative and qualitative behavioral analysis that efficiently face the intrinsic people/objects tracking imprecision and provide context aware and semantic capabilities for better identifying a given activity. the validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework have been verified by using the well-known caviar dataset and comparing our system 's performance with other similar approaches working on the same dataset.

green_building	an adequate response to global climate change and low carbon economy development has become a worldwide concerned subject. as one of the energetically most intensive industries, construction industry is a key area to promote decarbonization, which is an important path to realize national strategic goals on carbon reduction in china. this paper focuses on low carbon technology integration management, and analyzes the existing research status of green building or low carbon buildings on the related evaluation indexes, then proposes an evaluation system framework for the low carbon technology integration innovation from the perspective of the system management. it points out, that the evaluation of low carbon technology innovation should be conducted by a smarter managing of system resource input, the process control and the system comprehensive performance as an output. furthermore, based on the questionnaire survey and the exploratory factor analysis result on the selected indexes, this paper implements a rough set method to identify the weight of all the indexes and found that:(1) managers focus more on the affordable input of the beginning stage and the management control in the middle period of the innovation, instead on the output performance in the later stage. this indicates, that the management control during the front stages is more essential than this during the later ones; (2) the constructed evaluation framework, from the system perspective, can properly reflect the integrity, multi -level stakeholder structure and technology integration in low carbon projects, which could support the decision-maker into considering the complexity of construction and evaluation of the technology innovation performance from multi -level perspective; (3) the combined methods, adopted with exploratory factor analysis and rough set evaluation to determine the evaluation index and its weights, could well reflect the overall performance of low carbon project evaluation, the selected indicators have certain scientific and practical effectiveness, which could provide references for enterprise on lct innovation management. as an industry with a multi -level technologies integration, the single technological adoption or innovation cannot satisfy the economic transformation requirements of the modern construction industry development. an integration innovation management evaluation model is needed for the sustainability evaluation in the construction practice. its development is the main scientific objective of this study, by taking into consideration the entire life cycle assessment and various other factors.

solar_energy	there are many studies related on the sno2/sno based solar thermochemical water splitting cycle, however there are still no studies addressing on the detailed thermodynamic analysis of this process using hsc chemistry software and its thermodynamic database. in this cycle, the first step belongs to the endothermic solar thermal reduction of sno2 producing gaseous sno and o-2. the second step corresponds to the exothermic production of h-2 via water splitting reaction using sno produced in the first cycle, thereby regenerating sno2 which can be recycled back to step 1. thermodynamic equilibrium compositions associated with step 1 and 2 are identified as a function of reaction temperatures and partial pressures of o-2 in the inert carrier gas. furthermore, the thermodynamic efficiency analysis is performed by following the second law of thermodynamics to determine the cycle and solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiencies associated with the sno2/sno based thermochemical water splitting cycle. effects of thermal reduction and water splitting temperatures on various thermodynamic parameters are also investigated in detail. obtained results indicate that the higher values of cycle efficiency (41.17%) and solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency (49.61%) are achievable by operating this cycle at a thermal reduction temperature of 1780 k and water splitting temperature equal to 800 k with 50% heat recuperation. this work gives a detailed thermodynamic and efficiency analysis of sno2/sno based two-step solar thermochemical water splitting cycle for hydrogen production.

suspension_bridge	a study on the thermal performance of the tamar suspension bridge deck in plymouth, uk, is presented in this paper. ambient air, suspension cable, deck and truss temperatures were acquired using a wired sensor system. deck extension data were acquired using a two-hop wireless sensor network. empirical models relating the deck extension to various combinations of temperatures were derived and compared. the most accurate model, which used all the four temperature variables, predicted the deck extension with an accuracy of 99.4%. time delays ranging from 10 to 66 min were identified between the daily cycles of the air temperature and of the structural temperatures and deck extension. however, accounting for these delays in the temperature-extension models did not improve the models' prediction accuracy. the results of this study suggest that bridge design recommendations are based on overly simplistic assumptions which could result in significant errors in the estimated deck movement, especially for temperature extremes. these findings aim to help engineers better understand the important aspect of thermal performance of steel bridges. this paper also presents a concise study on the effective use of off-the-shelf wireless technology to support structural health monitoring of bridges.
rainwater_harvesting	silver has been known for centuries to be a powerful disinfectant, with no known harmful effects to humans if applied in adequate doses. although its use was partially discontinued with the advent of chlorination and modern antibiotics, the discovery of bacterial resistance and disinfection by-products has enabled its re-emergence as a viable water purification option. on the other hand, implementation in small-scale rainwater harvesting (rwh) systems has received little attention, possibly due to a general perception that it is a complex and/or expensive technology. this can be overcome by efficient designs that dose silver ions into the water at a minimal cost. the authors evaluated a dozen rwh systems equipped with silver releasing devices, which have been providing drinking water to schools and clinics in a rural area of mexico. this paper represents a follow-up to a previously published study on an evaluation performed in the same region. a number of water quality parameters have been analysed, examining the long-term efficiency of the projects. our observations show that the silver ion devices act as an effective disinfection mechanism, as long as adequate maintenance is provided. the combination with conventional settling tanks and filtration units seems to greatly enhance the overall performance of the system.
solar_energy	to meet the heating demand in north china and reduce the pollution of traditional chinese kang, a novel combined heating system consists of solar kang system and solar air heating system is proposed. the solar air system is built for the residents' daily heating demand. the solar kang system can store the solar energy collected in the daytime and provide a good sleeping environment at night. in this study, demonstration buildings are built in huzhu, qinghai province and one of them is chosen to test its thermal performance. three different operation modes: only the solar air system works, only the solar kang system works and the whole combined system works are tested. a mathematic model of the room and combined system is built based on the demonstrating building. output simulation results are compared with experiment data. the result shows the combined system can rise the indoor air temperature significantly and the simulation result can fit the experiment well. the indoor air temperature can keep about 18 degrees c when the ambient average temperature is 5 degrees c. kang surface temperature can keep above 26 degrees c during the night at the same condition. the study proves the excellent heating performance of the combined system.

rainwater_harvesting	background: legionella spp. employ multiple strategies to adapt to stressful environments including the proliferation in protective biofilms and the ability to form associations with free-living amoeba (fla). the aim of the current study was to identify legionella spp., acanthamoeba spp., vermamoeba (hartmannella) vermiformis and naegleria fowleri that persist in a harvested rainwater and solar pasteurization treatment system. methods: pasteurized (45 degrees c, 65 degrees c, 68 degrees c, 74 degrees c, 84 degrees c and 93 degrees c) and unpasteurized tank water samples were screened for legionella spp. and the heterotrophic plate count was enumerated. additionally, ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ema-qpcr) was utilized for the quantification of viable legionella spp., acanthamoeba spp., v. vermiformis and n. fowleri in pasteurized (68 degrees c, 74 degrees c, 84 degrees c and 93 degrees c) and unpasteurized tank water samples, respectively. results: of the 82 legionella spp. isolated from unpasteurized tank water samples, legionella longbeachae (35 %) was the most frequently isolated, followed by legionella norrlandica (27 %) and legionella rowbothamii (4 %). additionally, a positive correlation was recorded between the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of legionella spp. detected (rho = 0.710, p = 0.048) and the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of legionella spp. isolated (rho = 0.779, p = 0.0028) from the tank water samples collected. solar pasteurization was effective in reducing the gene copies of viable v. vermiformis (3-log) and n. fowleri (5-log) to below the lower limit of detection at temperatures of 68-93 degrees c and 74-93 degrees c, respectively. conversely, while the gene copies of viable legionella and acanthamoeba were significantly reduced by 2-logs (p = 0.0024) and 1-log (p = 0.0015) overall, respectively, both organisms were still detected after pasteurization at 93 degrees c. conclusions: results from this study indicate that acanthamoeba spp. primarily acts as the vector and aids in the survival of legionella spp. in the solar pasteurized rainwater as both organisms were detected and were viable at high temperatures (68-93 degrees c).
construction_management	civil engineering projects increasingly involve a wide range of stakeholders with diverse interests and multidisciplinary teams. engineers need soft skills to deal with these teams and stakeholders. ""how to educate these soft skills to engineering students?"" is the central question for technical universities. the course collaborative design and engineering in the dutch master 's programme construction management and engineering is an answer to that question. feedback, however, indicated that the course did not meet expectations. the course needed a radical redesign. this paper describes the redesign and resulting framework of the course. the principles of the redesign are constructive alignment, activated learning and not to lecture the skills as 'dry stuff. the resulting course is based on a 'pressure cooker - coaching' framework. the pressure cooker part creates a situation in which the students will experience stress. the students work in large groups on a complex assignment under time pressure. a mix of group and individual assignments creates tension between students. the coaching part provides structure and guidance. theory on the necessary soft skills is introduced early in the course in workshops. consultation meetings help to keep the students on track. the course has now evolved over three years. theoretical evaluation shows that the 'pressure cooker coaching' framework fulfills the requirements of constructive alignment. practical evaluation, using feedback, shows a consistent high score. we consider the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework broadly applicable and is successful enough to continue in our cde course. elements of the course can be improved. we consider introducing more theoretical depth and psychology without violating our idea of 'no dry stuff and 'action learning'
smart_material	mechanomutable asphalt binders are able to modify their mechanical behavior when they are activated by a magnetic field. under the effect of the magnetic field, these binders can increase their stiffness and perform elastically, and once the magnetic field is removed, the material recovers its original visco-elastic properties. because of this fact, these smart materials could offer a wide range of interesting engineering applications. one such use could be its incorporation into structures that are required to support cyclic loading, such as asphalt pavements, as they can be punctually activated to minimize the impact of traffic loads. based on these considerations, this paper studies the mechanical performance of mechanomutable asphalt binders under cyclic loads similar to those occurring in real pavements during their service life. for this purpose, a magneto-rheometer has been used to carry out different multiple stress creep and recovery tests under different magnetic field strength. the results obtained show that, in spite of the fact that these binders do not have a significant recovery capacity, they can reduce the cumulative permanent deformations produced in them due to the effect of cyclic loads when they are under the effect of a magnetic field.

rainwater_harvesting	in the mekong delta (md) in vietnam, piped-water supply stations are being intensively built to reach the millennium development goal (mdg) to provide safe and clean drinking water resources to communities. however, studies focusing on the effectiveness of supply stations in reaching these goals are scarce to date. water samples from 41 water supply stations in the md were collected between june and october 2012. water samples were analyzed for general parameters, salinity, nutrients, metal(loid)s and microbial indicator bacteria and compared with world health organization (who) and vietnamese drinking water guidelines. in addition, 542 household interviews were conducted to investigate the connection rate to piped-water and people 's perceptions regarding piped-water supplies. the results show that water guidelines were exceeded for ph (min. 6.2), turbidity (max. 10 ftu), cl (max. 1,576 mg.l-1), nh4 (max. 7.92 mg.l-1), fe (431.1 mu g.l-1), hg (11.9 mu g.l-1), and microbial indicator bacteria (max. total coliform 50,000 cfu 100 ml(-1)). moreover, more than half of the interviewed households with access to a piped-water supply did not use this supply as a source of drinking water due to (i) high connection fees; (ii) preference for other water sources; and (iii) perceived poor quality/quantity. our study shows that the maintenance and distribution of water supply stations should significantly improve in order for piped-water to become a reliable drinking water source. additionally, alternatives, such as rainwater harvesting and decentralized treatment facilities, should also be considered.
ambient_intelligence	elderly people constitute a major portion of world 's population. many of them are physically and mentally vulnerable and need continuous support for their health and well-being. there is a growing trend that these elderly people are placed in an ambient assisted living environment (aal) with an aim to receive better care and support. in such settings, a lot of attention has been given to continuous health monitoring for maintaining physical health status. however, much less attention has been given toward understanding the entertainment needs of the elderly people, which is an important factor relevant to their mental health and joyful living. this paper thus addresses the entertainment needs of the elderly and proposes a framework of an elderly entertainment support system. the proposed framework enables different categories of residents (e.g., elderly people and caregivers) to access various media services in both implicit and explicit manner in order to enhance the quality of their living experience in different contexts. our experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework. we believe that the proposed approach will establish the need to develop entertainment systems and services for the elderly people and allow us to sensibly address the problems associated with their independent, happy and active living.
geotextile	beaver slide is near 177.8km (110.5mi) on the dalton highway and the road gradient is approximately 11%, built on a hill side. each year, soft spots, also commonly named as frost boils, were observed starting from late april and lasting for the entire summer. the frost boils have resulted in an extremely unsafe driving condition and frequent accident occurrences. conventional repair methods cannot effectively solve this issue. a newly developed geotextile, which has high specific surface area, was installed in the selected test section to mitigate the frost-boil issue in august 2010. this type of geotextile can provide high wettability and relatively high suction (capillary force), consequently be able to laterally transport water (a high-directional transmissivity) under unsaturated conditions. test results over the initial 2years had proved the effectiveness of the geotextile to alleviate frost heave and the subsequent thaw-weakening issue. however, there were still some concerns regarding its long-term performance, such as clogging of the microscopic drainage channels and mechanical failures. the data collected during the past 5 years were used to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the wicking fabric. a scanning electron microscope was used to explore the interaction between the wicking fabric and in situ soils, and to determine the condition of the fabric 5 years after the installation.

ambient_intelligence	ambient assisted living can facilitate optimum health and wellness by aiding physical, mental and social well-being. in this paper, patients' psychiatric symptoms are collected through lightweight biosensors and web-based psychiatric screening scales in a smart home environment and then analyzed through machine learning algorithms to provide ambient intelligence in a psychiatric emergency. the psychiatric states are modeled through a hidden markov model (hmm), and the model parameters are estimated using a viterbi path counting and scalable stochastic variational inference (svi)-based training algorithm. the most likely psychiatric state sequence of the corresponding observation sequence is determined, and an emergency psychiatric state is predicted through the proposed algorithm. moreover, to enable personalized psychiatric emergency care, a service a web of objects-based framework is proposed for a smart-home environment. in this framework, the biosensor observations and the psychiatric rating scales are objectified and virtualized in the web space. then, the web of objects of sensor observations and psychiatric rating scores are used to assess the dweller 's mental health status and to predict an emergency psychiatric state. the proposed psychiatric state prediction algorithm reported 83.03 percent prediction accuracy in an empirical performance study.
suspension_bridge	premature failure of expansion joints is a concern for bridge owners. after opening to traffic, the jiangyin suspension bridge experienced frequent damage in expansion joints, and the problem remained unsolved even after replacement with new expansion joints and installation of viscous dampers at the girder end. this paper aims to clarify the failure mechanism of the expansion joints based on field test results. the field tests consist of three scenarios: static test, influence line test, and truck pass-by test. the tests aimed to investigate the behavior of expansion joints on both global and local scales. in the static and the influence line tests, it was found that strain response of the expansion joint is affected by the girder deformation, which reflects effect of global behavior of the bridge on the expansion joints. the truck pass-by test result shows that direct impact of heavy truck axles could induce high strain in expansion joints, which indicates that the expansion joints are affected by vehicle axle loading on a local scale. these results are in accordance with the premature failures observed in the expansion joints of the jiangyin bridge.

water_pollution	the removal of dye from industrial wastewater is one of the most important subjects in water pollution regulation. successive adsorption/desorption cycles of a basic dye, methylene blue, on internal almond shell, olive stone and rye straw were investigated by using fixed bed column experiments to study the adsorption capacity to remove the mb and adsorbents regeneration efficiency. the adsorption breakthrough curves were predicted by the thomas model, yoon nelson model, and wolborska model and modified dose-response model by using nonlinear regressive analysis. the adsorption capacity values obtained by this model are compared with the experimental capacity, noting an error of 16%, 27.8% and 18.9% for ias, os and rs respectively, but these errors are minimized in the second cycle to 22.98% and 6.06% for os and rs respectively. the results show that the modified dose response model is more suitable for the description of breakthrough curves for three adsorbents only in the first cycle. the ias presents the highest adsorption capacity and the best regeneration efficiency. conversely, the rs presents lower adsorption capacity, whereas is not the hardest to regenerate.
smart_material	optical fiber bragg grating (fbg) displacement sensors play an important role in various areas due to the high sensitivity to displacement. however, it becomes a serious problem of fbg cross-sensitivity of temperature and displacement in applications with fbg displacement sensing. this paper presents a method of temperature insensitive measurement of displacement via using an appropriate layout of the sensor. a displacement sensor is constructed with two fbgs mounted on the opposite surface of a cantilever beam. the wavelengths of the fbgs shift with a horizontal direction displacement acting on the cantilever beam. displacement measurement can be achieved by demodulating the wavelengths difference of the two fbgs. in this case, the difference of the two fbgs' wavelengths can be taken in order to compensate for the temperature effects. four cantilever beams with different shapes are designed and the fbg strain distribution is quite different from each other. the deformation and strain distribution of cantilever beams are simulated by using finite element analysis, which is used to optimize the layout of the fbg displacement sensor. experimental results show that an obvious increase in the sensitivity of this change on the displacement is obtained while temperature dependence greatly reduced. a change in the wavelength can be found with the increase of displacement from 0 to 10mm for a cantilever beam. the physical size of the fbg displacement sensor head can be adjusted to meet the need of different applications, such as structure health monitoring, smart material sensing, aerospace, etc.
water_pollution	with rapid socioeconomic development, water pollution emergency has become increasingly common and could potentially harm the environment and human health, especially heavy metal pollution. in this paper, we investigate the cd pollution emergency that occurred in the pearl river network, china, in 2005, and we build a migration and transformation model for heavy metals to simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of cd concentrations under various scenarios of cd pollution emergency in foshan city. moreover, human health hazard and carcinogenic risk for local residents of foshan city were evaluated. the primary conclusions were as follows: (1) the number of carcinogen-affected people per year under scenario 1 reached 254.41 when the frequency was 0.1 year/time; specifically, the number of people with cancer per year in the area of the datang, lubao, and nanbian waterworks was 189.36 accounting for 74% of the total number per year; (2) at the frequency of 5 years/time, the lubao waterwork is the only one in extremely high- or high-risk grade, while besides it, the risk grade in the datang, nanbian, xinan, shitang, and jianlibao waterworks is in the extremely high or high grade when the frequency is 0.1 year/time; (3) when cd pollution accidents with the same level occurs again, cd concentration decreases to a low level in the water only if the migration distance of cd is at least 40-50 km. based on the health risk assessment of cd pollution, this study gives the recommendation that the distance should keep above 50 km in tidal river network of the pearl river delta between those factories existing the possibility of heavy metal pollution and the drinking water source. only then can the public protect themselves from hazardous effects of higher levels of heavy metal.
smart_material	in this study, a new controllable engine mounting system for vibration control of passenger vehicles is proposed. the proposed mounting system consists of two smart material actuators: a piezostack actuator and a magnetorheological-fluid actuator. first, the dynamic responses of an in-line four-cylinder engine supported by three rubber mounts are mathematically analysed by considering the six-degree-of-freedom motion of the engine body, whose excitation is generated by the inner forces during the engine combustion process. second, the proper positions of the two actuators are determined. two magnetorheological mounts are used as roll mounts, and one piezostack mount is used as the right-hand mount, in order to reduce the unwanted engine vibration in a broadband frequency range. third, the piezostack mount and the magnetorheological mount are designed and manufactured, followed by installation in the engine mounting system. subsequently, for effective vibration isolation, a sliding-mode controller, which is robust to disturbances and system uncertainties, is designed. finally, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new engine mounting system, vibration control performances are evaluated by adopting the hardware-in-the-loop simulation test method associated with the sliding-mode controller. the vibration control responses are presented at various engine operating speeds in the time domain and the frequency domain. it was found that the vibration control performance is improved by 30% at an engine speed of 750 r/min and by 17% at an engine speed of 2000 r/min using the proposed engine mounting system associated with the controllers.
smart_material	originated from aerospace area, smart material structures have been a research hotspot in the application of engineering. for structural health monitoring within the context of civil engineering, the research about high-performance sensing units are very important. as one of the piezoelectric materials belonging to smart ones, polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) is widely regarded for its property advantages of low cost, good mechanical abilities, high sensibility, and corrosion resistance. in this paper, for the validation of pvdf sensors as sensing units for bridge structural local monitoring, wireless experimental systems of pvdf sensor for structural local monitoring on a bridge model and beam were built. firstly, based on the operating mechanism, the measurement circuit and the characteristics of pvdf are introduced. secondly, system framework of pvdf sensor for local monitoring is proposed, a bridge model is built, wireless sensor kits are then developed. finally, bridge damage monitoring experiments have been done for structural local health monitoring using pvdf sensors. the experimental results show that pvdf sensor can handle structural impact response monitoring and damage detection of civil engineering, and the developed wireless sensor experimental system can be easily implemented for use in practical monitoring engineering.
suspension_bridge	background: supraspinatus tears are common in pitchers. however, the effect of these tears on glenohumeral (gh) mechanics is incompletely understood. purpose/hypothesis: to describe the effect of supraspinatus tears and repairs on gh kinematics during an abbreviated throwing motion using the intact shoulder girdle. the hypothesis was that supraspinatus tears would lead to an increase of gh translation in the coronal plane and supraspinatus repairs would restore gh kinematics. study design: controlled laboratory study. methods: six shoulders from 3 fresh-frozen cadavers were tested in a novel 7 degrees of freedom robotic testing system. torsos were mounted and the wrist was pinned to an actuator mounted on an upper frame. after the deltoid was removed, the shoulders were studied during an abbreviated throwing motion (atm) from maximum external rotation to the midcoronal plane to establish a baseline. the atm was repeated after creation of a 1-cm supraspinatus tear, after creation of a 3-cm supraspinatus tear, and after repair with a transosseous equivalent (toe) technique. retroreflective bone markers and high-speed infrared cameras were used to measure gh kinematics and calculate the center of rotation of the gh joint (corgh) instantaneously. results: the 1- and 3-cm supraspinatus tears did not significantly alter gh translation. the toe repair shifted the corgh posteriorly, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the overall gh translation in all 3 planes (p = .003, .019, and .026, for x-y, y-z, and x-z planes, respectively). conclusion: in contrast to a toe repair of the supraspinatus tendon, isolated supraspinatus tears did not perturb gh kinematics in this cadaveric model of the throwing shoulder. clinical relevance: in throwing athletes, treatment of rotator cuff tears should be addressed with caution to avoid an unintended alteration in gh kinematics due to overtightening of the tendon.
construction_management	following widespread implementation of large projects with huge budgets and the need to finish them on time; as well as the importance of the final product quality and safety standards in large-scale projects, the necessity of this field of management was felt more than ever. this study is conducted to investigate and evaluate compliance of various and well-known standards of project management in civil projects. to achieve this, efforts are being made using statistical analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis method (topsis) and expert opinions, to analyze the compliance of these standards in the country 's development projects and provide usable solutions to improve the management of these projects. according to the results, it was observed that the pmbok standard is the best option followed by prince2 and opm standards, respectively.
smart_material	the optimized design of a smart post-buckled beam actuator (pba) is performed in this study. a smart material based piezoceramic stack actuator is used as a prime-mover to drive the buckled beam actuator. piezoceramic actuators are high force, small displacement devices; they possess high energy density and have high bandwidth. in this study, bench top experiments are conducted to investigate the angular tip deflections due to the pba. a new design of a linear-tolinear motion amplification device (lx-4) is developed to circumvent the small displacement handicap of piezoceramic stack actuators. lx-4 enhances the piezoceramic actuator mechanical leverage by a factor of four. the pba model is based on dynamic elastic stability and is analyzed using the mathieu-hill equation. a formal optimization is carried out using a newly developed meta-heuristic nature inspired algorithm, named as the bat algorithm (ba). the ba utilizes the echolocation capability of bats. an optimized pba in conjunction with lx-4 generates end rotations of the order of 15 degrees at the output end. the optimized pba design incurs less weight and induces large end rotations, which will be useful in development of various mechanical and aerospace devices, such as helicopter trailing edge flaps, micro and nano aerial vehicles and other robotic systems.
solar_energy	monolayer two-dimensional (2d) materials have promising optical properties and hold potential as solar absorbers for photovoltaic devices. efficient solar absorbers should have high absorption especially for wavelengths slightly smaller than the semiconductor bandgap wavelength. in this spectrum, solar cells have higher internal quantum efficiency, lower energy loss to lattice vibration, and resultant higher power conversion efficiency. 2d materials have been integrated into nanophotonic structures to enhance their absorption, but fabrication challenges hindered practical applications of these structures. here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrated a simple methodology to design efficient 2d material, and more generally, sub-nanometer planar, optical absorbers by placing a sub-nanometer film either onto a transparent layer on a metallic film substrate (structure 1) or between the transparent layer and the substrate (structure 2) with oblique sunlight illumination. we show that there always exist a pair of transparent layer thickness and incident angle for which these structures achieve 100% absorption (broadband and angle -robust absorption for structure 1 and narrowband for structure 2). 92% absorption, which is 2.6 times greater than prior theoretical demonstrations, was achieved in monolayer mos2 at 660 nm near its band edge to demonstrate material versatility (even materials with very low losses, which is counter-intuitive to conventional absorber designs). 2d material solar cells were further designed with 4.4% power conversion efficiency, a four-fold increase compared to prior designs. our proposed methodology is applicable to numerous materials with atomic-layer or sub-nanometer thicknesses and paves the way to efficient sub-nanometer-thick energy harvesting devices with simple planar structures.
solar_energy	solar radiation data is critical to the design and operation of solar energy utilization systems, so a large number of models have been proposed and developed to estimate solar radiation in the past ten years. however, the performances of such models are controversial in different studies, and there is a lack of systematic comparison among them. in addition, few studies pay attention to the time scales and practicability of the models. this paper focuses on solving these questions through a critical literature review and the authors believe it can benefit researchers to perform further investigations about solar radiation. this paper reviews and compares the models from the points of view of time scale and estimation type for the first time. furthermore, a large amount of data about the evaluation metrics (root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error) from different studies is summarized to clarify the performances of proposed models. the questions arising from the processing of source data are also carefully examined. this paper has presented a novel method to compare the estimation models and has provided a detailed analysis on available models. the results indicate that the sunshine duration fraction models and artificial neural networks have similar performances when used to estimate monthly average daily global radiation and daily global radiation, while more work is needed to study the estimation method on smaller time intervals and the mechanisms of atmospheric attenuation for solar radiation.
rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting is an ancient practice that involves collecting, storing, and using precipitation to meet on-site water needs. this paper develops and demonstrates guidelines for sizing the capacity of storage tanks to provide a reliable continuous supply of harvested rainwater for residential households. operation of the rainwater harvesting system is simulated with a stochastic mass balance performed on an excel spreadsheet. the daily volume of rainwater in an unbounded tank is tracked to determine the maximum accumulated deficit on a monthly basis. results are summarized in dimensionless charts showing the minimum size of a rainwater storage tank needed to meet water demands at specified levels of reliability.

water_pollution	developing highly active photocatalysts for water treatment is of vital importance. a large-mesopore hierarchical wo3 hydrate photocatalyst with exposed high energy facets was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method using sodium chloride as structure-directing agent. the forming model of the hierarchical structure was discussed, and photogenerated oxide species were investigated. it is shown that the orthorhombic wo3 center dot 1/3h(2)o photocatalyst is of a hierarchical structure assembled by various 2-dimension nanosheets and that its average pore diameter reaches approximately 33.2 nm. besides, it could decompose 92% of rhodamine b (rh b) under visible light irradiation within four hours. the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the exposed high energy (002) crystal facets of hierarchical structure, and to the large mesopores existing between crossed nanosheets which help to charge carriers separation, adsorption of reactants and desorption of product molecules. furthermore, the catalyst displays an excellent photocatalytic stability, indicating its broad application in water pollution treatment.

smart_material	a sensitive ph-triggered electrical switch is demonstrated by using a layer-structured silver nanowire/polyaniline nanocomposite film fabricated via an easy vertical spinning method. the as-prepared nanocomposite film shows the high electrical conductivity of 1.03 x 10(4) s cm(-1) at the ag-nw areal density of 0.84 mg cm(-2) and a good cycling stability. particularly, because of the layered structure, the switch achieves a very high contrast ratio of ca.9 x 108, which is 2-6 orders higher than that reported previously. the high electrical conductivity and the high switching ratio make the layer-structured nanocomposite film a sensitive switch candidate for ph-responsive systems. finally, a smart ph self-adjusting switching system is successfully designed using the as-prepared layer-structured nanocomposite film.
remote_sensing	on 24 october 2015, following a period of heavy rainfall, a landslide occurred in the calatabiano municipality (sicily island, southern italy), causing the rupture of a water pipeline supplying water to the city of messina. following this event, approximately 250,000 inhabitants of the city suffered critical water shortages for several days. consequently, on 6 november 2015, a state of emergency was declared (o.c.d.p. 295/2015) by the national italian department of civil protection (dpc). during the emergency management phase, a provisional by-pass, consisting of three 350-m long pipes passing through the landslide area, was constructed to restore water to the city. furthermore, on 11 november 2015, a landslide remote-sensing monitoring system was installed with the following purposes: (i) analyse the landslide geomorphological and kinematic features in order to assess the residual landslide risk and (ii) support the early warning procedures needed to ensure the safety of the personnel involved in the by-pass construction and the landslide stabilization works. the monitoring system was based on the combined use of ground-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (gb-insar) and terrestrial laser scanning (tls). in this work, the preliminary results of the monitoring activities and a remote 3d map of the landslide area are presented.
construction_management	purpose - the paper aims to reveal the most functioning project delivery systems for nearly zero-energy building (nzeb) projects. the focus is set to reveal the qualities of the systems that support the nzeb goals and sustainability. design/methodology/approach - research method used in this paper is inductive reasoning. the reasoning is based on existing literature, and conclusions are drawn by combining pieces of that literature. findings - the state-of-the-art heating, ventilation and air conditioning (hvac) and insulation requirements of nzeb technology and the lack of experience in the industry regarding nzeb projects suggest that modern collaboration-based project delivery systems should be favoured. the authors found that the most suitable project delivery system for a standard nzeb project is the integrated project delivery (ipd), which binds the financial goals of the main parties together via a reimbursement solution: target pricing. the authors also found the construction management (cm) at-risk system a suitable solution, especially if it is modified by adding the tools utilised in the ipd approach, thereby making it an ipd lite system. originality/value - the paper has value for the entire construction industry in finland and european union (eu). the owners and construction companies can use the findings in their development efforts towards nzeb construction. the eu 2020 nzeb degree makes all the findings concerning practicalities of nzeb projects valuable due to the lack of time and the lack of experience in the industry.
geotextile	in this study, prototype site cyclic loading experiments were carried out on the reinforced cushions constructed by geoocell and geotextile to confirm the stability of reinforced ground. the experiment reinforced grounds by some methods are constructed continuously in the site. the cycle loading is given by the load vehicle on the ground. as the results, the reinforcing effect of combination geocell with geotextile cushion was similar to that of combination geocell with geogrid cushion.
geotextile	in semiarid areas, slope restoration is usually hampered by high rainfall and temperature variability. these may cause severe erosion and slope instability, also environmental stresses, such as long-term drought and temperature extremes that lead to revegetation failure. in this study, three types of geotextiles including jute mat (jm), polyester mat (pm) and polyester net (pn) were installed on slopes and their effects on erosion control and vegetation growth were investigated by both laboratory and field experiments. the results of rainfall simulation experiments on laboratory plots showed that jm, pm and pn could delay the time to runoff, reducing runoff by 62.1%, 57.7% and 16.6%, and decrease erosion by 99.4%, 98.5% and 5.5%, respectively. field studies were also conducted on a restored rock slope in fengshan quarry, northeast beijing, china, in both 2010 and 2011. results indicated that jm, pm and pn could increase soil moisture by 54.5%, 36.3% and 18.7%, respectively, and provide more moderate soil temperatures that facilitate vegetation growth. the geotextiles were less effective in 2011 than in 2010 as a result of their degradation over time. slope stability and plant growth, however, were not affected due to the developed vegetation cover. thus geotextiles could protect slopes by preventing erosion and creating favourable soil conditions for revegetation, especially in the initial stage of slope restoration, and the natural geotextile mat (jute mat) is preferred since it is more effective and more environmental friendly.

remote_sensing	water and/or hydroxyl detected remotely on the lunar surface originates from several sources: (i) comets and other exogenous debris; (ii) solar-wind implantation; (iii) the lunar interior. while each of these sources is interesting in its own right, distinguishing among them is critical for testing hypotheses for the origin and evolution of the moon and our solar system. existing spacecraft observations are not of high enough spectral resolution to uniquely characterize the bonding energies of the hydroxyl molecules that have been detected. nevertheless, the spatial distribution and associations of h, oh-or h2o with specific lunar lithologies provide some insight into the origin of lunar hydrous materials. the global distribution of oh-/h2o as detected using infrared spectroscopic measurements from orbit is here examined, with particular focus on regional geological features that exhibit oh-/h2o absorption band strengths that differ from their immediate surroundings. this article is part of the themed issue 'the origin, history and role of water in the evolution of the inner solar system'.

remote_sensing	landslide triggered by earthquake or rainstorm often results in serious property damage and human casualties. it is, therefore, necessary to establish an emergency management system to facilitate the processes of damage assessment and decision-making. this paper has presented an integrated approach for mapping and analyzing spatial features of a landslide from remote sensing images and digital elevation models (dems). several image interpretation tools have been provided for analyzing the spatial distribution and characteristics of the landslide on different dimensions: (1d) terrain variation analysis along the mass movement direction and (3d) morphological analysis. in addition, the results of image interpretation can be further discussed and adjusted on an online cooperating platform, which was built to improve the coordination of all players involved in different phases of emergency management, e.g., hazard experts, emergency managers, and first response organizations. a mobile-based application has also been developed to enhance the data exchange and on-site investigation. our pilot study of guanling landslide shows that the presented approach has the potential to facilitate the phases of landslide monitoring and information management, e.g., hazard assessment, emergency preparedness, planning mitigation, and response.
geotextile	the use of conventional drip and alternative micro irrigation systems were evaluated for 3 years in six newly planted cultivars (earliblue, duke, draper, bluecrop, elliott, and aurora) of northern highbush blueberry (vaccinium corymbosum l.). the drip system included two lines of tubing on each side of the row with in-line drip emitters at every 0.45 m. the alternative systems included geotextile tape and microsprinklers. the geotextile tape was placed alongside the plants and dispersed water and nutrients over the entire length. microsprinklers were installed between every other plant at a height of 1.2 m. nitrogen was applied by fertigation at annual rates of 100 and 200 kg.ha(-1) n by drip, 200 kg.ha(-1) n by geotextile tape, and 280 kg.ha(-1) n by micro-sprinklers. by the end of the first season, plant size, in terms of canopy cover, was greatest with geotextile tape, on average, and lowest with microsprinklers or drip at the lower n rate. the following year, canopy cover was similar with geotextile tape and drip at the higher n rate in each cultivar, and was lowest with microsprinklers in all but 'draper'. in most of the cultivars, geotextile tape and drip at the higher n rate resulted in greater leaf n concentrations than microsprinklers or drip at the lower n rate, particularly during the first year after planting. by the third year, yield averaged 3.1-9.1 t.ha(-1) among the cultivars, but was similar with geotextile tape and drip at either n rate, and was only lower with microsprinklers. overall, drip was more cost effective than geotextile tape, and fertigation with 100 kg.ha(-1) n by drip was sufficient to maximize early fruit production in each cultivar. microsprinklers were less effective by comparison and resulted in white salt deposits on the fruit.
water_pollution	an approximately 59-year (1955-2014) sedimentary record of metal elements (cu, pb, zn, ni, co, mn, and fe) in a sediment core, collected from the huaihe river, huainan city, anhui province, china, was reconstructed by using pb-210 geochronology. copper, zn, ni, co, and mn evaluated by enrichment factor (ef) indicated minor contamination due to water pollution accidents of the huaihe river that occurred in 1990s and 2004. lead presented the most severe pollution among the metals studied, especially during 1957-1974. the use of leaded petrol and atmospheric deposition of coal combustion flue gases could have contributed to pb contamination. in spite of the general good quality (mean sediment pollution index (spi) 35.69) of the sediment core evaluated by spi based on the principal component analysis, worse sediment qualities in the upper section (<6 cm, 2004) were still observed, suggesting intensive human activities causing the increasing concentrations of metals in recent decades.
smart_material	the origami waterbomb base is a single-vertex bistable origami mechanism that has unique properties which may prove useful in a variety of applications. it also shows promise as a test bed for smart materials and actuation because of its straightforward geometry and multiple phases of motion, ranging from simple to more complex. this study develops a quantitative understanding of the symmetric waterbomb base 's kinetic behavior. this is done by completing kinematic and potential energy analyses to understand and predict bistable behavior. a physical prototype is constructed and tested to validate the results of the analyses. finite element and virtual work analyses based on the prototype are used to explore the locations of the stable equilibrium positions and the force-deflection response. the model results are verified through comparisons to measurements on a physical prototype. the resulting models describe waterbomb base behavior and provide an engineering tool for application development.
smart_material	ion-exchange polymer-metal composites known as a type of electro-active smart material has complex mechanism, and takes on nonlinear characteristic, which blocks its development and utilization. in this paper, a new model for electro-active smart actuator based on non-integer order models is proposed. an experimental setup has been realized to study the electro-active smart actuator non-integer behavior and an algorithm based on marquardt of least squares recursive identification has been developed in order to identify a fractional order model of electro-active smart actuator, and the fractional order simulation model is designed comparing the integer order model. simulation results demonstrate that the behavior of fractional order model is much better than the integer order model, and fractional order model of electro-active smart actuator can achieve better performance.
smart_material	the piezoelectric actuators as smart material actuator have been applied to fields which need high precision, fast response and high force. jet dispensing heads which are generally driven by pneumatics require above mentioned characteristics. to make jet dispensing head being driven by piezoelectric actuators, it is essential to use piezoelectric actuators must be used with displacement amplification mechanism due to low displacement generated by the piezoelectric actuators only. hence we fabricated displacement amplification mechanism by using three piezoelectric actuators. experiments were carried out to investigate the amplified displacements, amplification ratio and the effects produced by increasing input frequency. in this study, we observed the characteristics of displacement amplifier experimentally and it is confirmed and concluded from results that if the input frequency increases, the effect of phase lag becomes conspicuous.
remote_sensing	pixel-level image fusion has been applied in a variety of applications, including multi-modal medical imaging, remote sensing, industrial inspection, video surveillance, and night vision etc. various algorithms are being proposed for numerous applications which requires a comprehensive method of assessment to discern which methods provide decision support. currently, the validation or assessment of newly proposed algorithms is done either subjectively or objectively. a subjective assessment is costly and affected by a number of factors that are difficult to control. on the other hand, an objective assessment is carried out with a fusion performance metric which is defined to evaluate the effectiveness and/or efficiency of the fusion operation. there are a number of fusion metrics proposed for fusion processes taking different perspectives. most image fusion research presents a comparison of the proposed and existing fusion algorithms with selected fusion metric(s) over multiple image data sets. the proposed algorithm advantage is justified by the relative difference with the best or better metric values. however, the statistical significance of such difference is unknown leading to a misperception of the quantitative differences between methods. this paper proposes the use of non-parametric statistical analysis for comparisons of fusion algorithms along with the image fusion toolbox employing significance testing (imtest). strategies to use different tests in varied scenarios are presented and recommended. experiments with recently published algorithms demonstrate the necessity to adopt the statistical comparison to establish a baseline for image fusion research.

green_building	buildings consume a significant proportion of the world 's resources, mostly in the form of materials usage. in addition, with the ongoing efforts focusing on reducing the operational energy consumption of buildings, the embodied emissions of buildings are expected to increase in proportion in the future. with the increasing focus placed on the embodied emissions of buildings, organizations in the construction industry will face requirements to report information regarding the embodied emissions of buildings. however, in order to obtain the embodied emission of buildings, tremendous efforts have to be placed as the process is data intensive. in order to overcome this challenge, a streamlined technique is proposed to minimize the efforts required by practitioner to obtain the embodied carbon footprint. the proposed technique comprises a probabilistic model of emission factor estimators used to estimate the required embodied emissions. based on the four projects presented as case study for the proposed technique, the practitioner would be required to manually match the appropriate emission factors to the activity data for between 12 and 21% of the data points. this is in contrast to the current traditional technique, which requires the manual matching of 100% of data points. the resultant deviation of the computed embodied carbon footprint from the proposed technique and the current technique was between -0.25% and +3.65%.

rainwater_harvesting	academic research and technological innovation associated with rainwater harvesting (rwh) systems in the uk has seen a shift of emphasis in recent years. traditional design approaches use whole life cost assessments that prioritise financial savings associated with the provision of an alternative water supply. however, researchers and practitioners are increasingly recognising broader benefits associated with rainwater reuse, such as stormwater attenuation benefits. this paper identifies and describes a set of novel rwh system configurations that have potential for deployment in uk houses. conceptual schematics are provided to define these innovations alongside traditional configurations. discussion of the drivers supporting these configurations illustrates the opportunities for rwh deployment in a wide range of settings. a quantitative multi criteria analysis was used to evaluate and score the configurations under a range of emerging criteria. the work identifies several rwh system configurations that can outperform traditional ones in terms of specified cost and benefits. selection of a specific rwh technology is shown to be highly dependent on user priorities. it is proposed that the system configurations highlighted could enable rwh to be cost-effectively installed in a broad set of contexts that have experienced minimal exploitation to date.
ambient_intelligence	ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing are carrying the world to a reality where almost every object interacts with the environment, either via sensors or actuators, and users must learn how to interact with such systems. this paper presents a gesture-based interaction approach to manipulate such objects. we developed a prototype using a leap motion controller as a hand-tracking device, and a support vector machine as a classifier to distinguish between gestures. our system was evaluated by 12 users with over 10 commands. we also show a review on gesture-based interaction and compare other proposals with ours.
construction_management	off-site construction (osc) has been regarded as an effective means of improving construction quality and efficiency. the adoption of osc has been slower in developing countries such as china than in developed countries, and research on the barriers inhibiting the sector 's growth is inadequate. this paper aims to investigate the major factors inhibiting the adoption of osc with reference to the chinese construction market. thirty factors influencing the use of osc were identified through a literature review, questionnaire survey, and face-to-face interview with professionals in the construction industry. a questionnaire was sent out to developers in china, and 83 completed questionnaires were retrieved. ranking analysis was used to identify 18 critical factors. the top three barriers are absence of government regulations and incentives, high initial cost, and dependence on traditional construction methods. factor analysis enables grouping of the 18 critical factors into five categories, namely, government regulations and policies, technological innovation, industry supply chain, cost, and market demand. the paper also indicates that the most dominant of the five groupings pertains to regulations and policies. these findings provide a valuable reference for the developers to understand the major barriers to their decision making and for government bodies aiming at promoting osc in the construction industry to put forward relevant policies and incentives.
stealth_technology	fiber-rein forced composite materials have outstanding mechanical and electrical properties; their applications have been expanded to commercial products as well as military components. using composite materials, researchers have studied the radar absorbing, or 'stealth' technology. in this research, to develop the radar absorbing structure (ras), hybrid composite materials are fabricated into three-dimensional 'c' and 'u' shape shells. a series of experiments and analysis is conducted to characterize the ras shells. the hybrid composite consists of absorbing layers made of a three-phase composite (glass fiber/epoxy/earbon-black 5 wt%), and reflection layers made of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy. to manufacture the spring-back-free composite shells, aluminum molds with additional bending angles are used during the cure process of composite. finally, to evaluate the radar absorbing efficiency of the ras, radar cross section (rcs) is measured by a compact range method. the hybrid ras shows an average radar absorption efficiency of 11 db.
green_building	the concept of green building has gained rapid recognition recently. developed by the u.s. green building council, the leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) is one of the most successful green building rating systems. understanding the performance of leed certified buildings on various leed credits is therefore important for practitioners and regulatory authorities. this paper analyses the use of leed 2009 and investigates the credit allocation pattern of 3416 leed 2009 certified projects. the results show that compared to its previous version leed v2.2, the point chasing problem in innovation related credits is mitigated. however, energy-related and material-related credits remain difficult for developers to obtain. leed 2009 certified projects perform differently in water efficiency at the country level. at the state level, the projects perform differently in water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, material and resources, as well as indoor environmental quality. varied credit achievement patterns are also identified on cross-certification and cross sector levels. the study offers a useful guidance for practitioners to achieve relevant certification levels and for regulatory authorities to continuously improve the rating system.
ambient_intelligence	geo-fencing has been predicted to be a multi-billion dollar market in areas such as retail, ambient intelligence, entertainment, healthcare, etc. businesses have been adopting geo-fencing technology, and now there are several platform providers such as google, qualcomm, esri, urban airship, and others. these tools are continuing to attract application developers; however, best practices for choosing the specific performance options within this technology is still ambiguous. for example, esri provides a geo-trigger service that allows developers to send targeted messages to users when they enter, exit, or dwell in a geo-fenced area. this service also provides the ability to choose higher levels of accuracy or battery saving by offering different location tracking profiles. this paper investigated two geo-trigger tracking profiles (fine and adaptive) to assess their performance in small, outdoor, geo-fenced areas; these two profiles are the most accurate but vary in their battery-use. the results show the adaptive tracking profile to provide 100% reliability and average accuracy of 68.53 meters in geo-fences between 20-70 meter radii. in addition, the adaptive tracking profile saved 15.20% battery-life while the user is stationery and 9.23% while the user is moving.

suspension_bridge	the aim of this paper is to determine the effect of soil-structure interaction and time dependent material properties on behavior of concrete box-girder highway bridges. two different finite element analyses, one stage and construction stage, have been carried out on komurhan bridge between elazig and malatya province of turkey, over firat river. the one stage analysis assume that structure was built in a second and material properties of structure not change under different loads and site conditions during time. however, construction stage analysis considers that construction time and time dependent material properties. the main and side spans of bridge are 135 m and 76 m, respectively. the bridge had been constructed in 3 years between 1983 and 1986 by balanced cantilever construction method. the parameters of soil-structure interaction (ssi), time dependent material properties and construction method are taken into consideration in the construction stage analysis while ssi is single parameter taking into consideration in the one stage analysis. the 3d finite element model of bridge is created the commercial program of sap2000. time dependent material properties are elasticity modulus, creep and shrinkage for concrete and relaxation for steel. soft, medium, and firm soils are selected for evaluating ssi in both analyses. the results of two different finite element analyses are compared with each other. it is seen that both construction stage and ssi have a remarkable effect on the structural behavior of the bridge.
water_pollution	field and pretreatment-free detection of heavy-metal ions in organic polluted water is important but still challenging in current water pollution emergency response systems. here we report a polyadenine-dna-mediated approach for a rationally designed alkyne-coded surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) test kit, enabling rapid and simultaneous detection of hg2+ and ag+ by a portable spectrometer, impervious to organic interferences. because of the formation of thymine (t)-hg2+-t and cytosine (c)-ag+-c, highly recognizable sers signals are rapidly detected when two different alkyne-labeled gold nanoparticles (aunps) are induced to undergo controllable bridging upon the addition of low-volume targets. for multiplex detection through a portable spectrometer, the limits of detection reach 0.77 and 0.86 nm for hg2+ and ag+, respectively. of particular significance, the proposed c c-containing raman reporters provide an extremely effective solution for multiplex sensing in a spectral silent region, when the hyperspectral and fairly intense optical noises originating from lower wavenumber region (<1800 cm(-1)) are inevitable under complex ambient conditions.
solar_energy	new renewable energy has been drawing attention as fossil fuels are being depleted. the solar cell, a type of new renewable energy, can produce energy only during the daytime. the contaminants attached onto the surface of the solar cells module are following yellow dust, dust, and bird droppings. the low efficiency of solar cells is caused by reducing solar energy with contaminants. thus, it is important to remove the contaminants attached to the of surface solar cell modules. in this study, the surface properties of the glass substrate coated with functional nano thin films were analyzed on oven, microwave oven and natural drying conditions.
smart_material	this paper describes investigations of magnetorheological elastomers subjected to cyclic loading. the procedure comprised over 1 million of loading cycles per specimen. mechanical properties of the manufactured composites have a tendency to stabilize in time. this leads to the conclusion that these magnetorheological elastomers have a high application potential in the areas which are connected with energy dissipation, such as damping of vibrations.

ambient_intelligence	this paper presents a perception sensor network (psn) for detect audio-based emergency situations such as human scream. the psn consists of multiple units, each has a kinect and a pan-tilt-zoom camera. audio signals, which are acquired by the kinect microphone array, are used in sound source classification and sound source localization. in order to work in multi-person scenarios, we propose an audio-visual fusion method to detect a single speaking person among multiple ones. the psn system was demonstrated in a scenario having four persons, where the system is able to detect and localize the screaming person and send a robot to that location to check his/her condition.
suspension_bridge	the paper presents the results of an experimental and theoretical investigation on the pietratagliata cable-stayed bridge (udine, italy). ambient vibration tests were performed in order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the lower vibration modes of the bridge. structural identification is carried out by means of a manual tuning procedure based on finite element models of increasingly accuracy. the analysis allows to improve the description of boundary conditions and mechanical interaction between the bridge components. results from local dynamic testing are used to estimate the traction on the cables and to assess the integrity of the suspending system of the bridge.
solar_energy	the heating demands are currently fulfilled through conventional technologies based on fossil fuels. however, due to rapid depletion and environmental hazards of fossil fuels, the focus has shifted to harness the heat energy from renewable energy resources such as solar energy. in general, flat plate and evacuated tubes collectors are used for water heating yet there is another technology known as solar thermal tower (stt) which can be used for heating applications. the current study is focussed on real time performance analysis of solar thermal tower water heating system under climate conditions of taxila, pakistan. initially, a mathematical model is developed to design a small capacity solar thermal tower system. the system is simulated using matlab for five different climate conditions of pakistan i.e. peshawar, taxila, multan, karachi, and lahore for potential assessment. afterwards, an experimental setup is developed at taxila consisting of a cavity type receiver made of stainless tubes, heliostats made of mirror and complete instrumentation for data measurements. the performance analysis is presented in terms of temperature difference (delta t), absorbed heat (q(abs)), and efficiency (eta) with fixed and variable positions of heliostats for 12 selected days between september and february. the results showed that the maximum temperature difference with fixed heliostats position was 3 degrees c, q(abs) was 27 w and the maximum efficiency was 30%. however, with variable heliostats positions, the maximum value of temperature difference achieved was 16 degrees c that resulted q(abs) 170 w and efficiency 34%. finally, a reasonable agreement between simulated and experimental results was obtained for climate conditions of taxila.

rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting technology is considered an innovative and effective mechanism for reducing drinking water risks due to arsenic contamination and water salinity in coastal bangladesh. however, adoption of such tanks remains elusive. most studies on disaster risk communication are predominantly based on individual-level cognitive modeling approaches, which fail to address the role of social groups, human relations, and other collective social factors in the dissemination process of disaster preventive measures. from the viewpoint of social implementation, community adoption of unfamiliar technology for disaster risk mitigation and preparedness requires another approach. given the challenge to promote rainwater harvesting technology in the study area of coastal bangladesh, this study examines the role of various social networks including cohesive groups (friends), structural equivalent groups (individuals who have the same position in society), and spatial groups (neighbors) in three information sharing and processing activities-hearing, observation, and discussion. results show that those individuals who have similar cohesive affiliations tend to become hearing and discussion partners. cohesive groups share a learning opportunity and are bounded by normative constraints in terms of direct and intimate social relations. spatial groups facilitate observation, which provides visual learning. structurally equivalent groups are not relevant in adoption dissemination; therefore competition or similar social environment did not influence the rainwater tank dissemination activities.
rainwater_harvesting	low impact development (lid) and water sensitive urban design have as one of their tenets the use of rainwater harvesting (rwh) systems to provide water for use on site. historically implemented in arid or semi-arid regions, rwh has recently surged in popularity in more humid regions, such as the southeastern usa, due to increased interest in water conservation during severe drought conditions. an lid commercial site in raleigh, nc, incorporated rwh with other stormwater control measures to mitigate runoff quantity and improve runoff quality. a 57,900-liter rwh tank used for landscape irrigation was monitored to determine influent and effluent water quality. samples were analyzed for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total kjeldahl nitrogen (tkn), total ammoniacal nitrogen (tan), nitrite-nitrate (nox), orthophosphate (ortho-p) and total suspended solids (tss). low concentrations were observed for all pollutants monitored; for example, influent and effluent tp concentrations were 0.02 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively. statistical testing showed significant increases in tan and organic nitrogen (on) concentrations by 33 and 38%, respectively, from inflow to outflow. nox and tss concentrations decreased significantly by 23 and 55%, respectively. concentrations of all other pollutants were not significantly different between the inflow and outflow. influent concentrations to the rwh tank were less than previously published rainfall pollutant concentrations, indicating potentially irreducible concentrations onsite. while a single case study, this rwh system appears to offer some pollutant mitigation, especially for tss.
green_building	the matter of environmental concern prioritization integrated into globally used green building rating systems is a fundamental issue since it determines how the performance of a structure or development is reflected. certain nationally-developed certification systems are used globally without being subjected to adjustments with respect to local geographical, cultural, economic and social parameters. this may lead to a situation where the results of an evaluation may not reflect the reality of the region and/or the site of construction. the main objective of this paper is to examine and underline the problems regarding the issue of weighting environmental concerns in the leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) certification system, which is a us-originated but globally used assessment tool. the methodology of this study consists of; (i) an analysis of the approach of leed in the new construction and major renovations scheme in version 3 (leed nc, v.3) and the building design and construction scheme in version 4 (leed bd + c, v.4), (ii) case studies in which regional priority credits (rpcs) set by leed for four countries (canada, turkey, china and egypt) are criticized with respect to countries' own local conditions, and, (iii) an analysis of the approaches of major environmental assessment tools, namely; breeam, sbtool, casbee and green star, in comparison to the approach in leed, regarding the main issue of this paper. this work shows that, even in its latest version (v.4) leed still displays some inadequacies and inconsistencies from the aspect of environmental concern prioritization and has not yet managed to incorporate a system which is more sensitive to this issue. this paper further outlines the differences and similarities between the approaches of the aforementioned major environmental assessment tools with respect to the issue of concern and the factors that should be integrated into future versions of leed.

smart_material	in order to research the field sensing characteristic of the carbon fiber smart material, the tikhonov regularization principle and the modified newton-raphson(mnr) algorithm were adopted to solve the inverse problem of the electrical resistance tomography (ert). an ert system of carbon fiber smart material was developed. field sensing characteristic was researched with the experiment. the experimental results show that the specific resistance distribution of carbon fiber smart material is highly consistent with the distribution of structural strain. high resistance zone responds to high strain area, and the specific resistance distribution of carbon fiber smart material reflects the distribution of sample strain in covering area. monitoring by carbon fiber smart material on complicated strain status in sample field domain is realized through theoretical and experimental study.
green_building	geopolymers are novel binding materials produced by the alkaline activation of rich aluminosilicate materials. geopolymer binders are considered as green building materials that have increasing potential to replace the ordinary portland cement in the concrete industry. this study investigated the alkali solution effects on the physical and mechanical properties of the high calcium fly ash based geopolymers. the parameters involved in this study were the naoh solution molarity and the na2sio3/naoh ratio. three naoh concentrations (8, 10, and 12 molars) were investigated. the na2sio3/naoh ratio was varied between 1 and 2.5. the results showed that the studied parameters significantly affected the properties of the produced geopolymer mortars. the workability and setting time were found to decrease by increasing the naoh concentration or by increasing the na2sio3/naoh ratio. the influence of the naoh concentration was higher on the workability and setting time while the na2sio3/naoh ratio highly affected the compressive strength. the initial setting time was in the range of 45-105 minutes while the final setting occurred quickly after that within 70-115 minutes. oven curing method resulted in high strength at early ages where all of the mixes were able to achieve more than 75% of the 28 days strength within the first 3 days. the 28-days compressive strength ranged between 60-85 mpa, which promotes the use of the high calcium fly ash for the production of early high strength geopolymer concrete.

geotextile	highbush blueberry (vaccinium corymbosum l.) is a calcifuge (acid-loving) plant that responds favorably to mulching with organic matter (om). until recently, most blueberry plantings in northwestern united states were grown with a mulch of douglas fir sawdust, with additional nitrogen (n) fertilizer applied to compensate for n immobilized by sawdust decomposition. a field trial was established in oct. 2006 in aurora, oregon, usa to evaluate alternative mulches (as partial or full replacement for sawdust) within a certified organic system. mulch treatments were: sawdust alone (9 cm depth); yard debris compost (4 cm) covered with sawdust (5 cm); and geotextile weed mat. the treatments were applied at planting and comprised one component of a factorial trial that included two cultivars ('duke' and 'liberty'), two bed configurations (raised and flat), two fertilizer sources (fish emulsion and feather meal), and two fertilizer rates (low and high). the organic mulches were reapplied, and the weed mat was replaced, after four growing seasons. average cumulative yields over the first 5 years of fruit production (2008-12) were 9.0 kg/plant with sawdust, 9.3 kg/plant with 'compost + sawdust', and 9.6 kg/plant with weed mat; and the treatment with the highest cumulative yield, regardless of mulch, was 'liberty' fertilized with either a low or high rate of feather meal. by 5-6 years after planting, soil om was 37 g.kg(-1) with 'compost + sawdust', 32 g.kg(-1) with sawdust, and 30 g.kg(-1) with weed mat. soil ph remained in the optimum range for blueberry in each treatment (ph 4.5-5.5), but soil k at a depth of 0-20 cm was higher with 'compost + sawdust' (400 mg.kg(-1)) than with sawdust or weed mat (250 mg.kg(-1) each). leaf nutrient concentrations, including k, ca, and mg, were nonresponsive to the mulch treatments. overall, this study demonstrated that application of yard debris compost provided a large benefit to soil om maintenance and increased soil test k, but had no effect in 6 years on tissue nutrient concentrations in the blueberry leaves.
suspension_bridge	increasing applications of large diameter and long-span cables as key structural components in cable-supported structures are becoming evident. however, these cables accumulate damage over time during their life cycle and such damage needs to be detected to avoid the detrimental influences on the serviceability and ultimate capacity of the structure. in this context, vibration-based damage detection (vbdd) methods have been used in some structures. cable structures however exhibit complex vibration patterns, namely with vertical, lateral, torsional and coupled modes which complicate the vbdd procedure. to address this matter, this paper proposes a new approach for detecting and locating damage in cables using component-specific damage indices (dis) based on the modal flexibility method considering the modal mass participation. application of this new procedure is illustrated through two case studies: (a) a suspended cable and (b) a three dimensional (3d) suspension bridge structure. results verify that the dls based on the lateral and vertical components of mode shapes, identified through their modal mass participation factors, are effective for detecting and locating damage in the suspended cables and main cables in a suspension bridge respectively, under a range of damage scenarios. the research outcomes of this paper confirm that the modal mass participation factor is an important signature in the damage detection of a structure using vbdd techniques.
ambient_intelligence	this study analyzes muscle activity, recorded in an eight-channel electromyographic (emg) signal stream, during the golf swing using a 7-iron club and exploits information extracted from emg dynamics to predict the success of the resulting shot. muscles of the arm and shoulder on both the left and right sides, namely flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum communis, rhomboideus and trapezius, are considered for 15 golf players (similar to 5 shots each). the method using gaussian filtering is outlined for emg onset time estimation in each channel and activation sequence profiling. shots of each player revealed a persistent pattern of muscle activation. profiles were plotted and insights with respect to player effectiveness were provided. inspection of emg dynamics revealed a pair of highest peaks in each channel as the hallmark of golf swing, and a custom application of peak detection for automatic extraction of swing segment was introduced. various emg features, encompassing 22 feature sets, were constructed. feature sets were used individually and also in decision-level fusion for the prediction of shot effectiveness. the prediction of the target attribute, such as club head speed or ball carry distance, was investigated using random forest as the learner in detection and regression tasks. detection evaluates the personal effectiveness of a shot with respect to the player-specific average, whereas regression estimates the value of target attribute, using emg features as predictors. fusion after decision optimization provided the best results: the equal error rate in detection was 24.3% for the speed and 31.7% for the distance; the mean absolute percentage error in regression was 3.2% for the speed and 6.4% for the distance. proposed emg feature sets were found to be useful, especially when used in combination. rankings of feature sets indicated statistics for muscle activity in both the left and right body sides, correlation-based analysis of emg dynamics and features derived from the properties of two highest peaks as important predictors of personal shot effectiveness. activation sequence profiles helped in analyzing muscle orchestration during golf shot, exposing a specific avalanche pattern, but data from more players are needed for stronger conclusions. results demonstrate that information arising from an emg signal stream is useful for predicting golf shot success, in terms of club head speed and ball carry distance, with acceptable accuracy. surface emg data, collected with a goal to automatically evaluate golf player 's performance, enables wearable computing in the field of ambient intelligence and has potential to enhance exercising of a long carry distance drive.
remote_sensing	remote sensing observations are extensively used for analysis of environmental variables. these variables often exhibit spatial correlation, which has to be accounted for in the calibration models used in predictions, either by direct modelling of the dependencies or by allowing for spatially correlated stochastic effects. another feature in many remote sensing instruments is that the derived predictor variables are highly correlated, which can lead to unnecessary model over-training and at worst, singularities in the estimates. both of these affect the prediction accuracy, especially when the training set for model calibration is small. to overcome these modelling challenges, we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely sensed data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory. we use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in the predictors by principal components and bayesian regularization. it has a spatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that are not explained by a simple linear model. an efficient markov chain monte carlo sampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in all the model parameters. we tested the proposed model against several alternatives and it outperformed the other linear calibration models, especially when there were spatial effects, multicollinearity and the training set size was small.

rainwater_harvesting	water consumption in residential parts of urban areas is just one part of the water management problems. contemporary potable water management is not sustainable whereas we use potable water for flushing toilets, irrigation or washing vehicles. the appropriate solution is to substitute potable water with rainwater for some purposes and this water source is considered sustainable. submitted paper presents risk assessment using risk analysis of the rainwater harvesting (rwh) system. this paper does not deal with the system in details but informs about the selected approach of the evaluation methodology verified by analytical hierarchy process.

remote_sensing	detecting artificial targets, such as aircraft, in satellite images is significant in military and civil applications. although the performance has improved with the use of more complicated features and better learning methods, effectively handling aircraft with variations of type, pose, and size is still very challenging. to solve this problem, we propose a multiscale sliding-window framework based on aggregate channel features, well-designed features that contain rich information. we also employ a fast feature pyramids algorithm to accelerate multiscale aircraft detection. in this framework, features are trained by cascade adaboost including multiple rounds of bootstrapping that leads to improved overall accuracy. a two-step nonmaximum suppression algorithm is carefully designed based on a given set of detections. our method shows a competitive performance on the quickbird images of 0.6 m resolution.
rainwater_harvesting	the treatment of rainwater is typically performed by the diversion of the first flush and the use of strainers to retain gross particles (e.g. leaves). to date, there is a lack of rainwater treatment systems with both high efficiency to remove small suspended particles, and simple operation without energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. the objective of this work was to develop and test a novel concept for the filtration of particles in raw rainwater with no energy usage, self-cleaning mechanism, and simple installation and operation in buildings. for this purpose, an innovative concept was developed based on an up-flow filtration with down-flow backwashing operation. the concept was tested by building a prototype, in which the treatment efficiency for particle removal as well as the backwash efficiency were assessed for three different filter media. results showed that the system designed under the proposed concept operated effectively with the correct selection of the filter medium. therefore, the proposed rainwater treatment concept offers an opportunity to enhance water security by treating and using rainwater in buildings in an efficient, simple, and energy-free way.

green_building	growth in healthcare needs challenges providers to reduce operational costs and is expected to increase construction and renovation of healthcare facilities. meanwhile, concerns regarding the environmental impacts of hospitals have made the healthcare sector one of the most prominent settings for the green building movement. despite these environmental concerns, the number of studies that document the benefits of sustainable healthcare facilities is limited. in this study, the authors used national cost report data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services and developed a benchmarking tool for comparing the operation and maintenance costs of healthcare facilities with their peers. the authors then used longitudinal data and compared the annual operation and maintenance cost of 32 leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) hospitals to the median cost of non-leed facilities of comparable type, ownership, and location. analysis failed to provide any evidence that achieving more leed credits or leed certification in general lowers operation and maintenance costs of healthcare facilities.

rainwater_harvesting	rainwater harvesting (rwh) is a practice of growing importance in the united kingdom, particularly in the southeast of england where the water availability per person is even less than in many mediterranean countries. although there is a huge amount of rainfall in the north and west of england and wales, water resources in the southeast and east of england are under pressure due to the growing population and the changing climate. therefore, rwh becomes particularly important to reduce the dependence on the mains water supply. in the present study, suitable areas for rwh in the uk have been identified using a geographic information system-based decision support system (dss) and remote sensing. the dss undertakes a combination of thematic layers such as rainfall surplus, slope, curve number, land cover/use, and soil texture. the spatial extents of suitability areas for rwh were identified using multi-criteria evaluation. the spatial distribution of the suitability map shows that the excellent suitable areas for rwh are in the northwest of uk but less suitable areas in the northern and eastern parts. on average, the suitability for rwh in the uk was found that 18.95 and 27.25 % of the area are excellent and good, about 23.53 % is moderate, whilst 30.26 and 0.02 % are unsuitable and poor, respectively. the use of a number of rwh sites in the excellent areas is recommended to ensure successful implementation of rwh systems.
rainwater_harvesting	biogas could provide a more sustainable energy source than wood fuels for rural households in sub-saharan african. however, functioning of biogas digesters can be limited in areas of low water availability. the water required is approximately 50dm(3)day(-1) for each cow and 10dm(3)day(-1) for each pig providing manure to the digester, or 25 (+/- 6)dm(3)day(-1) for each person in the household, using a digester volume of 1.3 (+/- 0.3)m(3) capita(-1). here, we consider the potential of domestic water recycling, rainwater harvesting, and aquaculture to supply the water needed for digestion in different countries of sub-saharan africa. domestic water recycling was found to be important in every country but was usually insufficient to meet the requirements of the digester, with households in 72% of countries need to collect additional water. rooftop rainwater harvesting also has an important role, iron roofs being more effective than thatched roofs at collecting water. however, even with an iron roof, the size of roof commonly found in sub-saharan africa (15 to 40m(2)) is too small to collect sufficient water, requiring an extra area (in m(2)) for each person of (r/100) (where r is the rainfall in mm). if there is a local market for fish, stocking a pond with tilapia, fed on plankton growing on bioslurry from the digester, could provide an important source of additional income and hold the water required by the digester. in areas where rainfall is low and seasonal, the fishpond might be stocked only in the rainy season, allowing the pond to be covered during the dry period to reduce evaporation. if evaporative losses (e in mm) exceed rainfall, an extra catchment area is needed to maintain the water level in the pond, equivalent to approximately (1.5x((e-r)/r))m(2) for each person in the household.
green_building	mounting awareness of climate change in recent years has led the construction industry to initiate new approaches toward sustainable building design, yet stakeholders in hospitality development still hesitate to build green. this reluctance is due to perceived high guest expectations of comfort levels and amenity access among these properties. research was conducted to determine precisely which green building innovations present the most significant barriers to incorporating sustainability into design for hospitality. average leed credit implementation rates among 28 existing leed hotel projects were calculated and compared with average credits employed among common commercial building projects. 15 of those projects' designers also offered survey opinions on which sustainable innovations were most commonly avoided in their approaches for hospitality. the results indicate that certain credits do experience decreased popularity among hospitality projects, yet guest comfort was not the only barrier identified. cost of implementation and local applicability affected by climate and local bylaws were also found as major role players in the selection of credits specific to hospitality design. conclusions are presented according to the data and recommendations made to support further growth and success in future applications of leed sustainable design in hospitality.

construction_management	in recent decades, discrete event simulation (des) has been widely used for analyzing construction projects. recently, fuzzy discrete event simulation (fdes), which is an integration of fuzzy set theory with des, has been proposed for simulating construction projects. fdes provides a framework to consider subjective uncertainty (uncertainty due to vagueness, subjectivity, and linguistic expression of knowledge) in construction simulation models. current fdes frameworks only calculate simulation time (e.g., project completion time) as the simulation output. however, queue performance measures (e.g., average queue length and waiting time) though important simulation model outputs for decision making, finding bottlenecks, and optimizing construction resources are not analyzed in current fdes methodologies. using fuzzy logic to consider the subjective uncertainty of service time and the inter-arrival time of systems' queues may improve such simulation models by more realistically representing their results. this paper provides a novel methodology to consider subjective uncertainty in analyzing the fuzzy queues in construction fdes models. incorporating fuzzy queuing theory with fdes methodology as proposed in this paper enhances the applicability of fdes in construction projects. the proposed methodology is validated through mathematically solved queueing examples, and its practical aspects are illustrated using an example of an asphalt paving operation.

geotextile	irrigation is a service provided to agricultural crops in order to improve their yields. this is also a rare situation where the location of the costumers (roots) is not known and the heterogeneity in the water delivery system (soil) effects the water distribution. this non-uniformity of soil-plant conditions in the agricultural field complicates decision-making parameters regarding irrigation management (where to place sensors, how many sensors are needed, when and how much to irrigate). many aspects of this non-uniformity have been studied in the past decades, including soil hydraulic properties, tillage history, irrigation method, sensor location, measured volume, and more. one aspect that has been relatively neglected is how plant roots affect variability. in this work, we focus on the effect that growing roots have on the variability of tensiometer measurements. corn seeds were sown in a pre-designed experimental plot that consisted of three very distinct soils (sand, sandy loam, clay) to create high variation in investigated conditions. subsurface drip irrigation was installed in the plot, and the drippers of the center line were wrapped with geotextile to create a geotextile-drip interface (gdi), i.e., a volume which has preferred conditions for root growth. tensiometers were installed in the gdi (gdi treatment) and 10 cm away from the drip lines (s10 treatment); the matric head was monitored throughout the season. the weekly averaged coefficient of variation (cv) of the gdi treatment decreased as the corn plants grew, for each soil type and the entire plot. as time passed and the corn plants grew, cv peaks, due to irrigation, and the duration of high cv decreased because of the increasing influence of root water uptake on fluxes in the measured volume. after harvest, the cv returned to initial values. s10 tensiometers showed higher cv values than the gdi tensiometers during the last week of growth. after harvest, the cv of the s10 tensiometer measurements decreased, contrary to the trend in the gdi tensiometers. the results point to the major influence of roots on matric head variability, first, by decreasing variability with time and second, through the effect of tensiometer location since the gdi tensiometers were located in volumes with high root density. this influence has major consequences regarding the methodology of tensiometer measurements to represent an agricultural field, and might provide means for global guidelines for tensiometer placement and irrigation management.

geotextile	usage of the geotextile based artificial soil materials recently increase in coastal protection applications. these materials are become important such as temporary solutions, lack of supplying natural materials (rock), quick solutions cases. one of the most important applications of geotextile application in coastal engineering is one or several layer geotubes overlap each other replacements as height as wave run up in the coast line or near protecting coastal area. stability of these type of structures are generally tested by numerically and wave loads determined over geotubes. in the presented paper, numerical model generated extreme wave loads over the geotube was compared with a bearing capacity of geosynthetic in black sea coast of turkey for protecting filled zone.
stealth_technology	this paper presents an equivalent circuit model of metamaterial absorber (ma) based on triple hexagonal shaped resonators. this metamaterial unit cell absorber possesses a nearly wide angle perfect absorption of incidence wave and polarization independence. the absorption is occurred in three different frequencies. the absorptivity is as high as 98%, 93% and 94%, at 3.5 (ghz), 4.7 (ghz) and 6.6 (ghz), respectively. the equivalent circuit model of a single hexagonal ring has been extended to the triple band absorber structure. the simulation of the circuit model agrees well with the full-wave simulation, regarding to return loss and absorption. the important features of this method are simple fabrication of metamaterial absorber and maximum absorption in three frequencies. the proposed metamaterial absorber has wide applications such as thermal detector, stealth technology and imaging. moreover, a very good agreement between simulation and measurement results has been observed.
water_pollution	continental-scale water quality modeling is a new scientific approach concerned with computing the level of water pollution for several river basins at once. uncertainties in these models, and in models of smaller scale, arise especially from the specification of model parameters. to identify and analyze these uncertainties we perform a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using latin hypercube sampling on the worldqual water quality model. the focus of the analysis is the river pathogen model of worldqual as applied to rivers in africa. this is the first uncertainty and sensitivity analysis performed on a continental-scale pathogen river pollution model. the median output uncertainty of the model (coefficient of variation, based on log-transformed data), assuming plausible estimates of 42 parameter uncertainties, was 10.7%; 90% of grid cells had output uncertainties below 23%. the parameters making the largest contribution to this uncertainty (in order of importance) are the pathogen waste loading per capita, the in-stream settling velocity of pathogens, the percentage of population in a river basin connected to a sewer system, and the raw effluent concentration from the manufacturing sector. over the continental study area, model output uncertainty and the most sensitive parameters were found to have a highly irregular spatial pattern. this finding suggests that model performance is a strong function of local and regional conditions and that reducing the uncertainty of a single parameter may not lead to large improvements in model performance over the entire continent. a more efficient approach would be to improve model performance region-by-region and improve the estimation of specific parameters known to have a large influence on model uncertainty in those regions. the analysis showed that only four parameters dominate output uncertainty over 93% of the study area, implying that model performance can be substantially improved by reducing the uncertainty of a small number of parameters.

construction_management	the tiny house movement represents a unique building initiative that aims to reduce the environmental and financial impacts of modern living. this paper introduces the integration of a tiny house competition project into an undergraduate construction management curriculum, and investigates the role of building information modeling (bim) in facilitating sustainable living design and construction as well as student learning using an experiential and project-based pedagogy. as bim is prevailing across the global design and construction industry, higher education has been striving on developing effective pedagogy to cultivate students' competency in bim. most recently, the emphasis of bim education has been transforming from software training to problem-solving in the context of project execution and management. therefore, experiential and project-based learning seems to be a promising option for bim education. this paper highlights the synergistic bim usage in the tiny solar house project with broad student participation and comprehensive inclusion of both lower and upper division undergraduate construction management courses. the tiny solar house project provides the desired pedagogical construct that fosters active student learning engagement in attaining bim knowledge and developing problem-solving skills with bim at multiple phases that span from the inception of design, to construction and eventually the occupancy and operation.

geotextile	over the last few decades, geotextiles have progressively been incorporated into geotechnical applications, especially in the field of coastal engineering. geotextile materials often act as separator and a filter layer between rocks laid above and subgrade beneath. this versatile material has gradually substituted traditional granular materials because of its ease of installation, consistent quality and labour cost efficiency. however, geotextiles often suffer damage during installation due to high dynamic bulk loading of rock placement. this can degrade geotextiles' mechanical strength. the properties considered in this paper include the impact resistance and retained strength of geotextiles. in general, the greater the impact energy applied to geotextiles, the greater the potential for damage. results highlight the inadequacy of using index derived values as an indicator to determine geotextile performance on site because test results shows that geotextiles (staple fibre (sf) and continuous filament (cf)) with better mechanical properties did not outperform lower mechanical strength materials. the toughest cf product with a cbr index value of 9696n shows inferior impact resistance compared to sf product with the least cbr strength (2719n) given the same impact energy of 9.02 kj. test results also indicated that the reduction of strength for cf materials were much greater (between 20 and 50%) compared to sf materials (between 0 and 5%) when subjected to the same impact energy of 4.52 kj.

geotextile	movement of fluids in the unsaturated zone plays an important role in many geoenvironrnental engineering problems. examples include cover and basal liner systems for waste containment facilities where geosynthetics are widely used, amongst many other examples. this paper highlights the importance of assessing the unsaturated characteristics of geosynthetics and their influence on the behaviour of engineered systems where soils and geosynthetics interact under unsaturated conditions. it includes information on the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function of geosynthetics such as geotextiles and geosynthetic clay liners (gcls) with particular focus on capillary barriers, liner performance under elevated temperatures, and interface friction respectively. mechanisms involved in the development of capillary barriers are evaluated to explain the storage of water at the interface between materials with contrasting hydraulic conductivity (e.g. a fine-grained soil and a nonwoven geotextile). potential desiccation of gcls is explained in the light of an application in a liquid waste impoundment.

green_building	green building construction has been considered to be an essential practice for achieving sustainability. to achieve sustainable development, greater attention has been paid to environmental, social and economic impacts associated with the construction and operation of buildings. hence, the importance of a more integrated approach to green building design with cost effectiveness has gained momentum. the present study focuses on developing appropriate constructs to benchmark green building attributes in construction such that, with limited funds, the sustainable performance of the building is improved. in this study, indian green building assessment tools, such as green rating for integrated habitat assessment (griha), indian green building council (igbc), eco-housing, and a newly developed rating system, are reviewed. a data envelopment analysis (dea) has been employed to benchmark the green building attributes. buildings in different climatic conditions, such as hot and dry, warm and humid, and composite climates, were chosen for benchmarking purposes. efficiency was calculated using a constant return to scale with an input-oriented charnes-cooper-rhodes (ccr) formulation method. the following attributes were observed: (1) utilization of the bureau of indian standard (bis) recommended waste materials in the building, (2) increase in environmental awareness, (3) dedicated facilities for service staff, (4) design for universal accessibility, (5), low-impact design (6) construction management practices and (7) use of low-volatile organic compounds (voc) paints that contribute to more green points at a lower cost.

water_pollution	heterogeneous photocatalysis can be a suitable add-on process to conventional wastewater treatment methods aiming to the full degradation of emerging contaminants contributing to water pollution. this work examines the photo-degradation of two frequently detected emerging contaminants (caffeine and salicylic acid) using titanium dioxide nanotubular films (tnts) so as commercial tio2 nanoparticulate films (evonik p25) for comparison. the tnt films were prepared by electrochemical anodization of titanium metal and reached lengths of 20 pm, with a high growth rate (10 mu m/h). they present an open porous structure with large specific surface area suitable for efficient adsorption of the contaminants and formation of a large number of photocatalytic active sites. after calcination at 450 degrees c, tnt films obtain the anatase crystal structure, absorb well in the uv range and present significant photocatalytic activity with high degradation rates for both examined emerging pollutants. furthermore, they present small variability of their photocatalytic efficiency in a big range of the solutions ph values and under consecutive photocatalytic cycles, rendering them suitable at various wastewater treatment conditions.

solar_energy	in this article, von karman problem of infinite rotating disk is extended for the case where the space above the rough disk is equipped by an electrically conducting nanofluid. buongiorno model is employed to incorporate brownian motion and thermophoresis effects due to nanoparticles. mass transfer process is accompanied with zero normal flux condition. additionally, heat transfer mechanism is inspected through more general temperature jump conditions. accurate similarity solutions are developed for full range of slip coefficients by means of standard shooting procedure. also, a collocation based matlab routine is used for findings the solutions. the impact of parameters on the flow fields is depicted by plotting graphs. it is predicted that velocity distributions are inversely proportional to the magnetic field parameter. velocity slip effect also presents opposition to the momentum transport and reduces hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness. it is also found that brownian motion has negligible influence on the heat flux at rotating disk. further, thermal and concentration boundary layer thicknesses are increased due to the existence of thermophoretic force. axial velocity is negative due to the downward fluid motion caused by the disk rotation. the analysis for no-slip boundary can also be retrieved as a special case of the present model.

ambient_intelligence	the case study presented in this paper aimed at discovering opportunities for ambient intelligence and new interaction methods for a future remote crane-operating environment. the theoretical objective was to carry out an experience-driven research project in an industrial work context, and the practical objective was to create and evaluate a future-oriented science fiction prototype. the work was carried out in close co-operation with an industrial partner who was a domain expert in the field of crane industry. the aim was to focus on clearly defined user experience goals to which the industrial partner committed. the consequent immediate objective was to focus on two explicit experiences relating to 'feeling of being motivated' and to 'sense of community' that were placed at the core of the design investigations. these experiences were deliberated into a science fiction prototype entitled 'remote operator 's day in a future control center'. the science fiction prototype was further introduced to users by twofold means: as a plain, simple short story and through an interactive experience path. the main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate how an emerging technology research of a new domain may employ science fiction prototyping method as a primary means of experience design investigations.
smart_material	the preisach hysteresis model has been adopted extensively in magnetic and smart material-based systems. fidelity of the model hinges on accurate identification of the preisach density function. existing work on the identification of the density function usually involves applying an input that provides sufficient excitation and measuring a large set of output data. in this paper, we propose a novel compressive sensing-based approach for preisach model identification that requires fewer measurements. the proposed approach adopts the discrete cosine transform of the output data to obtain a sparse vector, where the order of all the output data is assumed to be known. the model parameters can be efficiently reconstructed using the proposed scheme. for comparison purposes, a constrained least-squares scheme using the same number of measurements is also considered. the root-mean-square error is adopted to examine the model identification performance. the proposed identification approach is shown to have better performance than the least-squares scheme through both simulation and experiments involving a vanadium dioxide (vo2)-integrated microactuator.
water_pollution	treatment of cow 's urine was first time explored in clayware microbial fuel cell (mfc) by varying dilution to have different chemical oxygen demand (cod) in the feed. improvement in power output of mfc was attained with increase in feed concentration from 1.5 to 3 kg cod/m(3); however further increase in influent cod up to 30 kg cod/m(3) decreased the power. maximum power of 5.23 w/m(3) was attained in mfc fed with diluted urine of cow with cod concentration of 3 kg cod/m(3), which was seven-fold higher than mfc fed with raw urine. nitrate removal of 77 +/- 4.1% and carbohydrate removal of 80 +/- 3.9% were achieved in mfc fed with 3 kg cod/m(3). electrochemical analysis showed that electrogenic activity of anodic biofilm boosted at optimum feed concentration (3 kg cod/m(3)) of cow 's urine in anodic chamber. using two mfcs, fed with diluted cow 's urine, maximum voltage of 1.36 +/- 0.05 v in series connection and maximum current of 48 a/m(3) in parallel connection were achieved. thus, cow 's urine can serve as sustainable yellow gold to harvest bioelectricity using low cost clayware mfc, and to curb the water pollution likely caused from cattle sheds.

water_pollution	to alleviate increasingly serious water pollution and shortages in developing countries, various kinds of policies have been implemented by local governments. it is vital to quantify and evaluate the performance and potential economic impacts of these policies. this study develops a computable general equilibrium (cge) model to simulate the regional economic and environmental effects of discharge fees. firstly, water resources and water environment factors are separated from the input and output sources of the national economic production department. secondly, an extended social accounting matrix (sam) of jiangsu province is developed to simulate various scenarios. by changing values of the discharge fees (increased by 50%, 100% and 150%), three scenarios are simulated to examine their influence on the overall economy and each industry. the simulation results show that an increased fee will have a negative impact on gross domestic product (gdp). however, waste water may be effectively controlled. also, this study demonstrates that along with the economic costs, the increase of the discharge fee will lead to the upgrading of industrial structures from a situation of heavy pollution to one of light pollution which is beneficial to the sustainable development of the economy and the protection of the environment.
rainwater_harvesting	the supply of water for rural populations in developing countries continues to present enormous problems, particularly where there is arsenic contamination in the groundwater, as exists over significant parts of bangladesh. in response, improvements in the sustainability of water supplies are feasible through the use of a combination of water sources wherein rainwater harvesting is employed for a portion of the year. this can potentially reduce the duration of the year during which arsenic-contaminated groundwater is utilized. as demonstrated, a rainwater cistern volume of 0.5 m(3) in the jessore district area of bangladesh can provide rainwater for periods averaging 266 days of the year, which allows groundwater at 184 mu g/l arsenic to be used as a water supply for the remainder of the year. this dual supply approach provides the body burden equivalent to the interim drinking water guideline of arsenic concentration of 50 mu g/l for 365 days of the year (assuming the water consumption rate is 4 l/cap/day for a family of five with a rainwater collection area of 15 m(2)). if the water use rate is 20 l/cap/day, the same cistern can provide water for 150 days of the year; however, although this is insufficient to supply water to meet the body burden equivalent guideline of 50 mu g/l. results are provided also for different rooftop areas, sizes of cisterns and alternative arsenic guidelines [world health organization (who) and bangladeshi]. these findings provide useful guidelines on supply options to meet sustainability targets of water supply. however, they also demonstrate that the use of cisterns cannot assist the meeting of the 10 mu g/l who target arsenic body burden, if the arsenic contamination in the groundwater is high (e. g., at 100 mu g/l).
suspension_bridge	this paper is concerned with a thermoelastic suspension bridge equations with memory effects. for the suspension bridge equations without memory, there are many classical results. however, the suspension bridge equations with both viscoelastic and thermal memories were not studied before. the object of the present paper is to provide a result on the global attractor to a thermoelastic suspension bridge equation with past history.
solar_energy	recently, interest in photosynthetic energy conversion has substantially increased. chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelle inside higher plants and algae, are the ultimate source of carbon-based fuels. however, they have been less studied in a photobioelectrochemical cell, because their electrochemical communication at an electrode surface is challenging due to their complex membrane system. although redox polymers are widely used for mediating bioelectrocatalysis, they have never been explored for wiring chloroplasts to electrodes. herein, a naphthoquinone-functionalized linear poly(ethylenimine) (nq-lpei) redox polymer is used as an electron transfer (et) mediator as well as the immobilization matrix for chloroplasts. they are immobilized on toray carbon paper electrodes (tps), and the photoexcited et from water oxidation is evaluated, showing that intact chloroplasts can undergo direct electron transfer (det) and mediated electron transfer (met). photocurrent generation by det of chloroplasts results in an oxidative current of 1.5 +/- 0.2 mu a cm(-2). on nq-lpei modified electrodes, the oxidative photocurrent increased to 4.7 +/- 0.7 mu a cm(-2) and further improved to 29 +/- 6 mu a cm(-2) in the presence of an additional diffusive mediator, 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone (dcbq). the oxidative current produced in the presence of light confirms the ability to oxidize water (h2o) at a chloroplast-modified electrode surface.
rainwater_harvesting	during the past two decades, government efforts to provide water access to rural communities in brazil 's semiarid northeast region have focused on building systems to capture and store rainwater, most importantly through the one million cisterns program (p1mc). this article presents an analytic model based on daily precipitation data to evaluate the sustainability of rainwater capture. application of this model to analysis ofthe p1mc reveals the heterogeneous climate in this region causes large spatial variability in the effectiveness of this program. in addition, the size of the area of capture, the run-off coefficient of the roofs, and the amount offirst-flush diversion also have important effects. this analysis demonstrates while rainwater capture can offer sufficient water for drinking, as a stand-alone solution it cannot meet p1mc objectives of guaranteeing sustainable and universal access to water for drinking, cooking, and basic hygiene in all regions and years.
green_building	economy is one of the three pillars of sustainability and one of the parameters taken into account by many green building labels. in the construction industry, there exist many methods that evaluate the project cost; however, none of the current methods takes into account the location of the economic flows or the final stakeholders that benefit from them. this paper proposes a new methodology for tracing the economic flows of a project, by classifying costs into 5 categories: labour, materials, energy, infrastructure, taxes and overhead and in two levels: local and regional. the aim is to facilitate economic decision making for local authorities, construction managers and project investors and to make the social dimension of these flows and the generalized impact of the project on the local society apparent. the applicability of the new methodology is tested through some case studies. it is observed that such an analysis provides useful insights with respect to the economic flows going to direct labour vs overhead and taxes as well as regarding the spatialized distribution of the cost of a project.
geotextile	coast parallel submerged breakwaters made of geotextile sand containers (gscs) are increasingly being incorporated into coastal management solutions because of their cost effective and environmentally friendly characteristics. these reduce the wave action on the lee side by forcing wave breaking and their stability is a function of the relative crest width, crest height, and the damage. the present work involves a physical model study on 1v:2h sloped trapezoidal submerged reefs constructed with 485 gm gscs with different alignments like perpendicular, parallel, and flemish. they have a height (h) of 0.25 m and varying crest widths (b) and are tested for stability for wave heights (h) of 0.1 m and 0.12 m and wave periods (t) of 1.5 s to 2.5 s in a water depth (d) of 0.3 m.

green_building	in this paper, the necessities of the green building energy saving technology developed is analyzed in detail, and understand the impact of the green building energy saving technology developed for the future development of the country and the people. then the construction of green building energy saving technology system is analyzed, and the problems in the process of building energy saving technology system of green building are analyzed, and the main construction direction of green building energy saving technology system is obtained.
solar_energy	an organic p-n bilayer, comprising of an n-type perylene derivative (ptcbi) and p-type lead phthalocyanine (pbpc), was prepared and examined in terms of photoelectrode in the water phase. the ptcbi/pbpc bilayer functioned as a photoanode, which generated a photocurrent due to the oxidation of reactant (i.e., fell(cn)(6)(4-)) at the pbpc surface. furthermore, the organo-bilayer also induced a photocatalytic reaction that originated from the oxidising and reducing powers produced at the pbpc and ptcbi, respectively. based on the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic studies, it has been noted that the ptcbi/pbpc bilayer can respond to the wide spectrum of solar energy (i.e., 400-1100 nm). however, on using metal free phthalocyanine (h2pc, p-type) as a reference p-type layer and its application as a photocatalyst material in combination with ptcbi, the generated ptcbi/h2pc bilayer did not show any photocatalysis particularly under the control irradiation of 700-1200 nm. thus, the present work demonstrated that the utilisation of a photocatalytic material responding to near-infrared energy is effective towards efficient output into product.

suspension_bridge	structural health monitoring of large multispan flexible bridges is particularly important because of their important role in civil infrastructure and transportation systems. in this study, the response of the yokohama bay bridge (ybb), a three-span cable-stayed bridge, to the 2011 great east japan earthquake is used to perform multi-input multi-output system identification studies. the extensive multicomponent measurements are also used to develop and validate data-driven nonlinear mathematical models that can predict the response of ybb to various earthquake records and can accurately estimate its damping characteristics when the system is driven into the nonlinear response range. a combination of least-square (parametric) and neural network (nonparametric) approaches is used to develop the mathematical models, along with time-marching techniques for dynamic response calculations. it is shown that the nonlinear mathematical models perform better than the equivalent linear models, both for response prediction and damping estimation. the importance of having an accurate approach for quantifying the damping due to the variety of nonlinear features in the ybb response is shown. this study demonstrates the significance of constructing robust mathematical models that can capture the correct physics of the underlying system and that can be used for computational purposes to augment experimental studies. given the lack of suitable data sets for full-scale structures under extreme loads, the availability of the long-duration measurements from the 2011 great east japan earthquake and its many strong aftershocks provides an excellent opportunity to perform the analyses presented in this study. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.
ambient_intelligence	we present a non-invasive ambient intelligence framework for the semi-automatic analysis of non-verbal communication applied to the restorative justice field. we propose the use of computer vision and social signal processing technologies in real scenarios of victim-offender mediations, applying feature extraction techniques to multi-modal audio-rgb-depth data. we compute a set of behavioral indicators that define communicative cues from the fields of psychology and observational methodology. we test our methodology on data captured in real victim-offender mediation sessions in catalonia. we define the ground truth based on expert opinions when annotating the observed social responses. using different state of the art binary classification approaches, our system achieves recognition accuracies of 86% when predicting satisfaction, and 79 % when predicting both agreement and receptivity. applying a regression strategy, we obtain a mean deviation for the predictions between 0.5 and 0.7 in the range [1-5] for the computed social signals.

suspension_bridge	the tcud method (kim and lee, 2001) can minimize undesirable lateral displacements in cable bridge structures by including the unstrained lengths of the cable members as unknowns and introducing additional constraint conditions. the axial deformations in the girder and the main tower deviating from the target configuration are, however, unavoidable when self-anchored cable bridges are considered. on the other hand, the ifm (initial force method) can be used to adjust the axial deformations to conform to the initial shape but it is critical that the unstrained lengths of the cables are accurately evaluated. in this study, improved schemes for the tcud method and the ifm for finding the initial shape of 3 dimensional cable-supported bridges under dead load, are presented. for this purpose, the tcud method and the initial force method are firstly reviewed. two improved algorithms, which can overcome shortcomings of the previous initial-shaping analysis methods, are developed based on an elastic catenary cable element and a nonlinear space frame element. finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed analysis algorithms are demonstrated through the numerical application to 3 dimensional initial shape problems for self-anchored suspension and cable-stayed bridges.
water_pollution	input- and output-based economic policies designed to reduce water pollution from fertilizer runoff by adjusting management practices are theoretically justified and well-understood. yet, in practice, adjustment in fertilizer application or land allocation may be sluggish. we provide practical guidance for policymakers regarding the relative magnitude and speed of adjustment of input- and output-based policies. through a dynamic dual model of corn production that takes fertilizer as one of several production inputs, we measure the short- and long-term effects of policies that affect the relative prices of inputs and outputs through the short- and long-term price elasticities of fertilizer application, and also the total time required for different policies to affect fertilizer application through the adjustment rates of capital and land. these estimates allow us to compare input- and output-based policies based on their relative cost-effectiveness. using data from indiana and illinois, we find that input-based policies are more cost-effective than their output-based counterparts in achieving a target reduction in fertilizer application. we show that input- and output-based policies yield adjustment in fertilizer application at the same speed, and that most of the adjustment takes place in the short-term.

smart_material	the aim of this review article is to examine solutions and challenges associated with adhesively bonded fibre reinforced polymer (frp) pipe sections. frp materials have been used in piping systems for more than 40 years. higher specific mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of frp makes it a potential candidate for replacing metallic piping structures. another advantage of frp structures is the large number of design variables available. despite the advantages associated with frp structures, their application is still limited, partly due to unsatisfactory methods for joining composite subcomponents and inadequate knowledge of failure mechanisms under different loading conditions. adhesively bonded joints are attractive for many applications, since they offer integrated sealing and minimal part count and do not require pipe extremities with complex geometries such as threads or bell and spigot configurations. normally, an adhesive joint results in more uniform stress distribution, undamaged fibre architecture, and smooth surface contours. in the present article, a comprehensive review of various joining techniques for frp piping through adhesive bonding is presented and damage mechanisms for different loading conditions are examined.

ambient_intelligence	researchers of different fields have been involved in human behavior analysis during the last years. the successful recognition of human activities from video analysis is still a challenging problem. within this context, applications targeting elderly care are of considerable interest both for public and industrial bodies, especially considering the aging society we are living in. ambient intelligence (ami) technologies, intended as the possibility of automatically detecting and reacting to the status of the environment and of the persons, is probably the major enabling factor. ami technologies require suitable networks of sensors and actuators, as well as adequate processing and communication technologies. in this paper we propose an innovative solution based on a real time analysis of video with application in the field of elderly care. the system performs anomaly detection and proposes the automatic reconfiguration of the camera network for better monitoring of the ongoing event. the developed framework is tested on a publicly available dataset and has also been deployed and evaluated in a real environment.
suspension_bridge	as one of the main characteristics of seismic waves, apparent wave velocity has great influence on seismic responses of long-span suspension bridges. understanding these influences is important for seismic design. in this article, the critical issues concerning the traveling wave effect analysis are first reviewed. taizhou bridge, the longest triple-tower suspension bridge in the world, is then taken as an example for this investigation. a three-dimensional finite element model of the bridge is established in abaqus, and the lanczos eigenvalue solver is employed to calculate the structural dynamic characteristics. traveling wave effect on seismic responses of these long-span triple-tower suspension bridges is investigated. envelopes of seismic shear force and moment in the longitudinal direction along the three towers, relative displacements between the towers and the girder, and reaction forces at the bottoms of the three towers under different apparent wave velocities are calculated and presented in detail. the results show that the effect of apparent wave velocity on the seismic responses of triple-tower suspension bridge fluctuates when the velocity is lower than 2000 m/s, and the effects turn stable when the velocity becomes larger. in addition, the effects of traveling wave are closely related to spectral characteristics and propagation direction of the seismic wave, and seismic responses of components closer to the source are relatively larger. therefore, reliable estimation of the seismic input and apparent wave velocity according to the characteristics of the bridge site are significant for accurate prediction of seismic responses. this study provides critical reference for seismic analysis and design of long-span triple-tower suspension bridges.
solar_energy	tube receiver with pin fin arrays inserting was introduced as the absorber tube of parabolic trough receiver to increase the overall heat transfer performance of tube receiver for parabolic trough solar collector system. the monte carlo ray tracing method (mcrt) coupled with finite volume method (fvm) was adopted to investigate the heat transfer performance and flow characteristics of tube receiver for parabolic trough solar collector system. to validate the feasibility of the developed mcrt and fvm combined method, the numerical results have been compared with experimental results conducted in the diss test facility in spain and the max relative error is less than 5%. the numerical results indicated that the introduction of absorber tube with pin fin arrays inserting design for the absorber tube of the parabolic trough receiver can effectively enhance the heat transfer performance. the average nusselt number can be increased up to 9.0% and the overall heat transfer performance factor can be increased up to 12.0% when the tube receiver with pin fin arrays inserting was used.

ambient_intelligence	an exciting paradise of data is emerging into our daily life along with the development of relative perceptive technologies in smart home. how to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. this paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (erar). the erar approach segments data flow based on aes dynamic segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on svm model. the aes dynamic segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (aes) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our erar approach performs better than the baseline approaches.
rainwater_harvesting	water harvesting systems are traditional technologies that have met the needs of local populations for many centuries indicating the systems are clearly sustainable. it is simply defined as a method for inducing, collecting, storing and conserving local surface run-off for future productive use. it is one of the oldest and most commonly used sustainable water management systems in india. there are various types of systems to harvest rainwater in india ranging from very simple to the complex industrial systems. examples of traditional rainwater systems in india include bamboo pipes and apatani systems of eastern himalayas, ghul of western himalayas, zabo and cheo-ozihi of north eastern india, dongs, garh and dara of brahmaputra valley, kund, khadin, talabs, beri, johad, baoli etc. of thar desert and gujrat, the havelis of jabalpur, bandh and bandhulia of satna, virda of gujarat, ahar-pynes of bihar, eri and kulam of eastern coastal plains, jackwells of islands, most of which showed immense structural simplicity and high efficiency. almost all forts in india, built in different terrains and climatic conditions, had elaborate arrangements for drinking water. most of the old temples in south india built centuries ago have large tanks in their premises. these tanks are either fed by harvested rain water or by tapping underground springs. the traditional water-wisdom at all levels of the society ensured adequate availability of water for all, which in turn, formed the basis for all round development and prosperity. we should again learn and comprehend the ancient knowledge and apply it in our modern society to get rid of the present water stressed condition.
rainwater_harvesting	as a result of the integration of different methodological tools (life cycle assessment and dynamics simulation) and studies to evaluate the economic cost and the potential environmental impact of alternative water supplies (rainwater and greywater) for urban use, the software program plugrisost (pluvials, greys and sustainability) has been developed. this modelling tool aims to contribute to urban water planning for smart city development. plugrisost is a simulation model that facilitates the evaluation of rainwater harvesting (rwh) and greywater systems at different scales of urban planning, it is the only tool known thus far to integrate structural elements such as the sizing of storage tanks, estimated cost and quantitative environmental analysis. plugrisost can be an adequate tool in the design stage because it provides environmental and economic information related to rainwater tank sizing and its estimates are more conservative than those of other tools. plugrisost contributes to the design of urban infrastructure of low environmental impact, such as infrastructure that incorporates the use of rainwater, and the self-sufficiency analysis of water in cities. using plugrisost, we have found that on the singlehouse scale, the economic viability of an rwh system would be possible if the price of water is greater than 4 euros/m(3); and the environmental analysis would be favourable to tanks with less than 5 m(3) of storage capacity. on the apartment-building scale, the results are 1.4 euros/m(3) and 33 m(3), respectively.

solar_energy	solar energy is a promising energy source for covering a great variety of applications from low up to high temperature levels. in this study, the most mature concentrating technology, a commercial parabolic trough collector (eurotrough et-150), is investigated energetically and exergetically for a great temperature range from 300 k to 1300 k. pressurized water, therminol vp-1, nitrate molten salt, sodium liquid, air, carbon dioxide and helium are the examined working fluids; each one to be studied in the proper temperature range. in the first part of this study, the optimum mass flow rate is determined to every working fluid separately. after this point, the exergetic and the energetic performance of the collector operating with all these working fluids is examined. the final results prove that the liquid sodium leads to the global exergetic maximum efficiency (47.48%) for inlet temperature equal to 800 k, while the maximum exergetic performance of helium, carbon dioxide and air to be 42.21%, 42.06% and 40.12% respectively. moreover, pressurized water is the best working medium for temperature levels up to 550 k, while carbon dioxide and helium are the only solutions for temperatures greater than 1100 k. the thermal analysis is performed with the ees tool.

rainwater_harvesting	the predictive nature of digital soil mapping makes it a labour-and cost-effective way of facilitating soil surveys. a digital elevation model was used to generate terrain attributes that can be used to infer the distribution of soil associations relative to the topography. two study areas - gladstone and potsane - in the free state province of south africa were considered. slope, aspect, contour and plan curvature, topographic wetness index and topographic morphological unit were used to develop a model for predicting soil associations. discriminant analysis was employed to develop the model. the model was trained on data obtained from gladstone and validated on data from gladstone and potsane. predicting soil form was unsatisfactory. prediction done on soil associations, with soils grouped as deep, shallow and valley-bottom soils (criteria closely related to the suitability for in-field rainwater harvesting), achieved acceptable improvement in prediction accuracy. for gladstone, when analysis was done using equal prior probability, accuracy percentages of 56.9%, 51.5% and 58.3% were found for calibration, cross-validation and areas suited to in-field rainwater harvesting, respectively. with prior probability set in accordance to sample frequency, the accuracy percentages were improved to 83.1%, 80.0% and 94.6%, respectively. in potsane, the prediction accuracy percentage was low (38.23%) with equal prior probability but markedly improved (67.65%) when prior probability was similar to sample frequency. these results support the validity of the statement that the predictive nature of digital soil mapping makes it a labour-and cost-effective way of facilitating soil surveys.
rainwater_harvesting	the water-energy nexus has been increasingly studied in order to elucidate the complex interdependence between water and energy resources, and, as a result, enhance management practices to conserve both resources alike. in this context, integrated water management plans have direct implications on the energy embodied into water and sewerage services. the objective of this study is to assess the potential for energy savings in water and sewerage services by means of on-site integrated water and sewage management strategies in low-income households in florianopolis, brazil. the studied water efficient measures include: (i) installation of water efficient fixtures (dual flush toilets and water efficient taps); (ii) reclamation of grey water from shower, washing basin, and laundry for toilet flushing; and (iii) rainwater use for laundry and toilet flushing. from the combination of these measures, the water and energy saving potential of seven integrated water and sewage management strategies were studied. moreover, the water consumption pattern at ten low-income households with conventional and water efficient taps were empirically determined using water smart meters; whereas, the rainwater supply capacity was estimated by using the computer programme netuno 4.0, and the grey water supply and sewage reduction capacities were determined using model equations. rainwater harvesting alone appeared as the least favourable strategy for energy savings as the energy consumption would increase 4% compared to a centralised system; while the combination of water efficient fixtures and grey water reclamation gave rise to the greatest energy saving potential (48%). the findings of this study indicate that, from an energy management point of view, the sustainability of the water sector is primarily associated with the reduction of effluents to centralised systems, rather than the use of alternative water sources.

geotextile	the application of geosynthetics in hydrotechnical engineering requires an appropriate selection with respect to soil properties and operational conditions of the structures. the paper presents the case of the slope failure of a deep drainage channel caused by the geotextile clogging phenomenon resulting from selecting an inappropriate material with respect to soil parameters. due to rapid changes of water level in the channel, which will occur during operation, it was required to protect the slope from periodically occurring seepage forces. the slope reinforcement was performed by placing the draining gravel layer between geotextile on the cohesive soil. on the top the openwork concrete plates were laid. despite the reinforcement, during intense rainfall even before the channel was filled, a long section of the slope slid down and destroyed the ecological reinforcement of channel bottom. in the paper this phenomenon was explained by the analysis of slope equilibrium conditions, along with the laboratory tests of water permeability and the clogging process of the applied geotextile.
suspension_bridge	simultaneous excitation of multiple lateral modes due to pedestrian loading has been observed on the london millennium footbridge and clifton suspension bridge in the uk. however, all previous experimental studies aiming to determine the pedestrian loading on laterally oscillating ground have focused on a single mode only. this shortcoming has arisen as a result of the lack of capability of previous experimental setups to deliver multi-mode vibrations. as a consequence, in all existing modelling approaches, the results from tests in a single mode are assumed to be representative of pedestrian behaviour universally. therefore, uncertainty remains as to whether the predictions of dynamic structural behaviour from these models can be trusted. to address this problem, tests have been conducted on a newly-developed instrumented treadmill mounted on top of a hydraulically actuated base, allowing for treadmill motion representing simultaneous motion in multiple bridge modes. this paper presents the results of these tests and relates them to the performance of the inverted pendulum pedestrian model previously shown to be capable of generating destabilising forces on the structure in multiple modes simultaneously.
water_pollution	environmental conservation and management policy first emphasized on water pollution control in japan. however, this kind of passive conservation policy is gradually being shifted to an active approach such as satoumi, which includes the restoration of biodiversity, biological productivity, habitat and a well-balanced nutrient cycle between land and sea. many satoumi creation activities were also characterized by activities which promote interactions between land and sea. in this paper, a case study of ago bay in shima city, mie prefecture, japan, is introduced in which land-sea interaction at two sites was improved by promoting water exchange across dikes constructed for land development and land reclamation. tidal flat restoration experiments conducted in ago bay clearly showed that the promotion of tidal exchange between the sea and wetland area on the inner side of dikes improved both deteriorated sediment quality and macro-benthos conditions. along with the results of this case study, future tidal flat restoration in japan is also discussed.

geotextile	in this paper, an optimal lightweight foamed mortar mix suitable is proposed for facilitating tunnel drainage carried out using the composite lining method. a physical performance evaluation and pore structure analysis is provided in order to assess the performance of different lightweight foamed mortar mix proportions with various void fractions and foam solution concentrations. furthermore, on the basis of an in-plane permeability test that simulated the permeation of fines of soil leaking with underground water, the formation and distribution of open-cell foams by measuring the outflow characteristics and outflow volume for each mix of the nonwoven geotextile and lightweight foamed mortar, which are the existing tunnel drainage materials was examined. consequently, a mix employing a foaming agent with a dilution rate of 2% (#1) showed a better drain performance than all the other mixes, because it had the most appropriately formed and distributed open-cell foams, the key component for tunnel drainage. in other words, the mix of dilution rate of 2% was thought to have achieved stable closed-cell foams because of the decline in the surface tension of the foams, as well as the optimal formation and distribution of open-cell foams that possess excellent permeability because of the cohesiveness between the foams. moreover, the thickness (drainage space) of it was approximately 17 times that of the nonwoven geotextile, and because the closed-cell and open-cell foams were connected like a spider web, it could be expected to reduce the blocking of drainage caused by the fines of soil.

solar_energy	smart thermal grids (stgs) are able to perform the same function as classical grids, but are developed in order to make better use of distributed, possibly intermittent, thermal energy resources and to provide the required energy when needed through efficient resources utilization and intelligent management. district heating (dh) plays a significant role in the implementation of future smart energy systems. to fulfil its role, dh technologies must be further developed to integrate renewable resources, create low temperature networks, and consequently to make existing or new dh networks ready for integration into future stgs. solar heating is a promising option for low-temperature dh systems. thermal energy storage (tes) can make the availability of the energy supply match the demand. an integration of centralized seasonal and distributed short-term thermal storages would facilitate an efficient recovery of the solar energy. this study, through modelling and simulation, investigates the impacts of such integration on the overall performance of a community-level solar dh system. the performance analysis results show that the solar dh system with integration of distributed and centralized seasonal tess improves system overall efficiency, and reduces dh network heat losses, primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, in comparison to the one without integration. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
geotextile	this paper reviews sixty-nine (69) field failures involving geotextile filters which performed unsatisfgctorily and are categorized herein as failures. they are grouped into four categories; inadequate design, atypical soils, unusual permeants, and improper installation. in the first category are poor fabric selection, poor fabric design, socked drainage pipe and reversing flow conditions. in the second category are fine grained soils, gap-graded soils, dispersive clays and ochre. in the third category are sludges, turbid water, alkaline water, leachates and agricultural waste liquids. in the fourth category are lack of intimate contact and completely adhesive clogging of surfaces. while not the topic of the paper, it should be noted that, most of these same conditions are known to be troublesome to sand filters as well as to geotextile filters.

green_building	building materials (bms) are major contributors to indoor emission sources of volatile organic compounds (vocs). in this study, 8 kinds of bms (including conventional and green) for ceiling, cabinetry, and flooring commonly used indoors were tested in a 216 l chamber. primary emissions of carbonyls (c-1 to c-8 aldehydes and ketones) at 48 h were 75-673 mu g m(-2) h(-1) from conventional bms, and 62 -151 mu g m(-2) h(-1) from green bms. primary emissions of btex at 48 h were 59-264 mu g m(-2) h(-1) from conventional bms, and 37-56 mu g m(-2) h(-1) from green bms. ozone initiated molar yields of carbonyls were 0.10-2.36 from conventional bms, and 0.13-0.86 from green bms. secondary emissions of carbonyls were 7-150 mu g m(-2) h(-1) from conventional bms, and 4-73 mu g m(-2) h(-1) from green bms. green bms had lower emissions than conventional analogs, especially for wooden flooring and gypsum board. bms with mineral content are the most promising materials in this study, given moderately high ozone deposition velocity but generating the least byproducts. secondary emissions determined in this study demonstrate that moderate indoor ozone concentrations may lead to increased concentrations of carbonyls, especially formaldehyde and acetaldehyde that potentially increase adverse chronic health effects.

green_building	integrated design (id) process encourages integration of team members in the design phase of green building projects through intense collaborative processes and free exchange of information. although integration in general and id in particular have been well theorized by construction management research community, there exists no systematic mechanism in the field to help owners, architects, and managers of green project teams assess the level of integration in their projects' id team environment in a practical manner. the key objective of the present article is therefore to use a qualitative-quantitative methodology to propose and validate an integration evaluation framework for green project teams and to statistically test the association between integration level and project success. the framework can be used by green project teams for comparison, benchmarking, or educational purposes and for integration evaluation and improvement in id team environments. this research also provides empirical evidence to anecdotes suggesting positive link between team integration and project success in green projects.
water_pollution	mineralization of sulfidic minerals including realgar, orpiment and pyrite occurs in argillic alteration zones in northeastern iran, which affects water quality and health in these semi-arid localities. geochemical source of ions in surface and ground waters was examined to evaluate potential effects of sulfidic mineralization on water quality. the surface and groundwater samples were analyzed to determine the major ions (na+, ca2+, mg2+, k+, hco3-, so42-, cl-) and trace elements (such as as, b, br). water-rock interactions and evaporation defined as the key phenomena on groundwater chemistry using gibbs diagram. concentrations of arsenic (as) varied from 16 to 606 mu g/l, which was higher than the who (2011). calculated ionic ratios revealed that anions and cations in surface and ground waters originated from partial leaching through ion exchange in alteration zones. we postulate that the primary source of as resulted from oxidation of as-bearing sulfide minerals such as orpiment, realgar and arsenopyrite in argillic-pyrite alteration zone. high ph (>8) could provide the alkalinity to increase sulfide oxidation and release as into the water. the stable isotope data (delta o-18 and delta h-2) indicated the origin of the waters, which is mainly meteoric precipitation with partial effects from evaporation processes and exchanging ions with surrounding rocks. this confirms the notion that the source of all analyzed ions including the toxic as is geogenic. hydrogeochemical process, which affected the water chemistry and thus environmental public health are likely to be water-rock interactions and evaporation.

suspension_bridge	based on recent findings, the main span of the vincent thomas suspension bridge crosses directly over the palos verdes fault, which has the capacity to produce a devastating earthquake. in spring 2000, the bridge underwent a major retrofit using visco-elastic dampers. this study focuses on seismic vulnerability of the retrofitted bridge. three-dimensional memberbased detailed and panel-based simplified finite element models of the bridge are developed. in order to show the appropriateness of these models, eigenproperties of the bridge are evaluated and compared with the system identification results obtained using ambient vibration data. in addition, a model validation is performed by simulating the dynamic response during the 1994 northridge earthquake and comparing with the measured response. finally, considering a set of strong ground motions in the los angeles area, nonlinear time history analyses are performed and the ductility demands of critical sections are presented in terms of fragility curves. the study shows that a ground motion with peak ground acceleration of 0.9 g or greater will result in plastic hinge formation at one or more locations with a probability of exceedance of 50%. also, it is found that the effect of dampers is minimal for low to moderate earthquakes and high for strong earthquakes.
