green_building	the development of building material science in the light of such flows as green building, architectural geonics, the concept of sustainable development poses new challenges for researchers, one of which is the human environment comfort improvement. comfort is closely related to a premise microclimate, which is formed as the result of heating and ventilation system interaction with the building materials of wall structures. traditionally, the role of building materials in this interaction is a passive one and is characterized by two properties: thermal conductivity and vapor permeability. a further increase in the efficiency of engineering systems is not possible without the inclusion of building materials in this process as an active component. it is known that the radiation heat exchange plays an important role in the distribution of energy indoors. this heat exchange takes place between the surfaces in the infrared range. moreover, the work of radiant heating systems is based on this principle. it has significant advantages as compared with traditional ones and has great prospects concerning the energy consumption reduction for heating. in this regard, they studied the issues of composite development which have a particular interaction character with a particular spectrum of infrared light.
water_pollution	many-year variations of water pollution and the state of more than two hundred of rivers (or their segments) in different latitudinal zones in european russia are estimated. in accordance with latitudinal zonality, space and time trends in variations of water quality and the state of rivers are identified. by the level of water pollution, most river ecosystems (or their segments) were classified as polluted and very polluted, very polluted and dirty, dirty and very dirty. a tendency toward water quality improvement could be seen in the recent decade. more than 50% of the examined river ecosystems are at the transitional state of passing from natural (and/or equilibrium) to crisis state.
smart_material	this article describes the development and validation of a new thermomechanically coupled multi-layered shape memory alloy beam finite element. the finite element is formulated, assuming coupled equilibrium equations for the mechanical and thermal problems. the constitutive shape memory alloy model of lagoudas and coworkers is implemented in the formulation. multi-field kinematic hypotheses are proposed, combining a first-order shear displacement field with a sixth-order polynomial temperature field through the thickness of the beam, enabling adequate representation of the temperature and phase transformation profiles due to rapid thermal loading, uneven thermal loading, and boundary conditions and multi-layered configurations with variable thermal properties. the non-linear transient discretized equations of motion of the shape memory alloy beam are synthesized and solved using the newton-raphson method with an implicit time integration scheme. numerical results illustrate the time response of uniform and bi-layered niti beams under various thermomechanical loads predicted by the developed finite element. correlations of the beam element predictions with those of plane stress two-dimensional finite element shape memory alloy models demonstrate excellent agreement in the calculated displacement, temperature, and phase transformation fields. additionally, the developed beam finite element yields computationally fast simulations providing an effective tool for the design and simulation of rod, beam, and strip shape memory alloy actuators and active structures.

construction_management	construction management is a practice oriented field and its course content needs to include many elements from practice. many new developments take place, new technologies emerge and the necessity of redefining working dynamics among project stakeholders necessitates construction educators to constantly evaluate and reorganize the scope of courses. this situation justifies the necessity of bringing research findings into classroom. the paper exemplifies how research findings are brought into a major construction course. project management course at the university of texas at san antonio covers broad range of topics such as fundamental concepts of management and roles in the construction industry, project delivery and contract methods, detailed analysis and administration of different phases of a construction project. the demand for sustainable projects is growing. its delivery method requires lots of input from wide range of experts. so far, there is no set or accepted method for sustainable building project delivery. during the coverage of project delivery methods, the instructor brings the characteristics of a sustainable projects. the comparative analysis is made between conventional and sustainable projects. the phases of sustainable projects include many additional elements and early involvement of defined tasks from phases of conventional projects. a recent research study accomplished by the author highlights the differentiating aspects of conventional projects from sustainable projects. the findings obtained from a research that is conducted with the major national firms will be incorporated to future lectures. the research has explored the sustainable delivery practices of the major national construction firms. they will be used as a case study to complement the theoretical part of the lecture. the impact on students' learning will be identified. students appreciate and value the knowledge brought outside the textbook especially if the research is original and accomplished by the course instructor. the approach can be taken as an example for various topics which are recent to aec industry.
suspension_bridge	background: pseudoparalysis is defined as active forward flexion less than 90 degrees with full passive motion. there is controversy about the ideal surgical management of a massive rotator cuff tear with pseudoparalysis. purpose/hypothesis: the purpose of this study was to prospectively analyze the ability to reverse pseudoparalysis with an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (arcr). the hypothesis was that in the absence of substantial glenohumeral arthritis, preoperative fatty infiltration of grade 3 or higher and an acromiohumeral interval (ahi) of less than 7 mm would not prevent reversal of pseudoparalysis with an arcr. study design: case series; level of evidence, 4. methods: a prospective multicenter study of arcr performed for preoperative pseudoparalysis was conducted. the minimum follow-up was 1 year. the mean patient age was 63 years, and pseudoparalysis was present for a mean of 4.2 months preoperatively. preoperative radiographic evaluation included plain film evaluation of the ahi and hamada classification and mri evaluation of fatty degeneration and rotator cuff retraction. functional outcome was determined by the simple shoulder test (sst), american shoulder and elbow surgeons (ases) shoulder score, visual analog scale (vas), and subjective shoulder value (ssv). results: of the 58 patients enrolled, 56 had at least 1 year of follow-up. mean active forward flexion improved from 47 degrees preoperatively to 159 degrees postoperatively (p < .001). statistically significant improvements were seen in the sst (from 2.8 preoperatively to 10.1 postoperatively), ssv (from 28 to 83), ases shoulder score (from 37 to 88), and vas (from 5.7 to 1.1) (p < .001). pseudoparalysis was reversed in 53 of 56 patients (95%). there was no difference in the rate of reversal of pseudoparalysis between those patients with an ahi of less than 7 mm (88.2%) and those with an ahi of 7 mm or more (96.9%) (p =.289). pseudoparalysis was reversed in all 8 of the patients with fatty degeneration of grade 3 or higher in 1 or more of the rotator cuff muscles. conclusion: arcr can lead to reversal of preoperative pseudoparalysis in patients with minimal preoperative glenohumeral arthritis. arcr is a viable first line of treatment for patients with pseudoparalysis in the absence of advanced glenohumeral arthritis.
geotextile	fatigue cracking is considered to be one of the main pathologies in asphalt pavements, contributing to the reduction of its service life and generating high costs as a consequence of more maintenance works. because of the importance of road quality in society 's economic development, techniques to avoid and reduce the adverse effects derived from cracking phenomena are necessary. for this purpose, this research focuses on the development of a sustainable and economic solution that uses reinforced polyethylene pond wastes as an antireflective cracking system placed between asphalt pavements layers. three different pavement sections were studied in the laboratory: a reference one with no anticracking system; a pavement section with geotextile as the common anticracking system; and a similar one with reinforced polyethylene pond waste. the results obtained from the mechanical performance testing showed that this technique could provide an optimal solution to reduce the effect of this pathology, and to offer a new way to valorize these wastes. in addition, in comparison with the other solutions, reinforced polyethylene pond liners are more effective in reducing the propagation of cracks through the asphalt pavement.
stealth_technology	in this contribution we propose an analysis of the absorbing capabilities of planar structures loaded with left handed material (lhm) based on resonant magnetic inclusions, operating at microwave frequencies. to this end, we 'll present a general formulation valid for any characteristic property of lhm. it is demonstrated that if a medium with the proposed constitutive properties is achieved, then some of the very common limitations of present day absorbers like the presence of metallic plates can be overcome. it is shown, also, that the introduction of lhm leads to an enlargement of the angular bandwidth with a reduction of the overall dimensions of the component. numerical results together with some remarks about possible practical implementations of the proposed components will be also given.
solar_energy	nigeria is the most populous country in africa (7th most populous in the world) and it is strategic to the realization of the united nations' sustainable development goals (sdgs) by 2030. however, sdg no. 7 (affordable and clean energy) and other goals connected to the reduction of climate change are crucial for the attainment of sustainable development in nigeria. this comprehensive review encompasses the discussions of the clean energy potential, obstacles to and stimulants of clean energy implementations, and renewable energy policies in nigeria. solar and biomass resources have been presented in this article because of their huge availability in nigeria. nigeria has the potential to produce an estimated 47.97 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) annually from biomass resources. likewise, 17, 459 billion mj/day of solar energy is incident on the total surface of nigeria. the biomass resources which can be tapped for renewable energy production in nigeria include jatropha with high oil contents, sweet sorghum and molasses; food crops such as cassava, rice, coconut, cashew, millet, rice, oil palm, maize, and yam; agricultural residues and wastes from food crops such as cassava peels, cassava liquid sludge, mango peel, mango seed kernel, rice husks (rh), corn residues, oil palm derivatives, sugar cane straw, and bagasse; forest resources; municipal solid wastes; and animal wastes. these resources can be exploited for the production of biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, briquettes and organic fertilizers through anaerobic digestion, transesterification, gasification, pyrolysis, and briquetting. there are also huge potentials for the deployment of solar photovoltaic (pv) and thermal systems in off-grid, grid-connected, and hybrid installations. it can be concluded that the techno-economic feasibility and environmental significance of solar power and bioenergy for nigeria 's sustainable development is site-specific and subject to factors such as incentives and financing, research and development, public enlightenment, government 's policies, and private investments.
remote_sensing	arctic river icings are surface ice accumulations that can be >10km(2) in area and >10m thick. they commonly impact the hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology of arctic river environments. previous examination of icing dynamics in arctic alaska found no substantial changes in extent through 2005. however, here we use daily time series of satellite imagery for 2000-2015 to demonstrate that the temporal persistence and minimum summertime extent of large icings in part of arctic alaska and canada have declined rapidly. we identified 122 large ephemeral icings, and 70 are disappearing significantly earlier in the summer, with a mean trend of -1.60.9day(-1) for fully ephemeral features. additionally, 14 of 25 icings that usually persist through the summer have significantly smaller minimum extents (-2.61.6%yr(-1)). these declines are remarkably rapid and suggest that arctic hydroclimatic systems generating icings, and their associated ecosystems, are changing rapidly. plain language summary liquid water emerging from groundwater and flowing through arctic rivers during the winter often freezes into large ice features, which are called river icings. these icings, which are found in nearly all parts of the arctic, create wide, gravelly river channels that can be important habitat for animals. when icings melt during the summer, they help keep rivers flowing when other water sources are limited. up until now, no study has systematically looked at whether these features are changing in response to warming temperatures. we use daily satellite imagery available over northern alaska from 2000 to 2015 in order to test whether icings are becoming smaller or disappearing earlier in the summer. of 147 features examined, we found that 84 are either becoming smaller (for those that persist throughout the summer) or are disappearing earlier (for those that fully melt each summer). none are becoming larger or disappearing later. these changes may be directly related to warming temperatures, but they may also be happening because climate change is altering how rivers and groundwater interact. if these trends continue, we may see changes in the form of many arctic rivers and impacts on the habitat of animals like fish and caribou.
rainwater_harvesting	the practice of rainwater harvesting (rwh) is spreading rapidly in urban areas. this article studies the impact of a possible generalization of this practice for municipalities by proposing a new method to quantify the potential for potable water savings (ppws) by using rainwater harvesting at the urban level. the proposed method is based on the adaptation of an already validated model assessing the ppws for single buildings and the use of urban databases. two concepts are introduced: (1) the ""building type"" that allows gathering all the buildings sharing common features; and (2) the ""equivalent building,"" which is used to assess the ppws of a set of buildings (of a same building type) as if it were a single building. in the case of the municipality of colombes (located in the suburbs of paris), the method shows that the ppws by using rainwater harvesting represents about 10% of the total potable water consumption: the residential buildings account for 64% of this potential. this method can be applied to other municipalities with a level of acceptable reliability with regard to the means to be implemented in terms of collecting information.
