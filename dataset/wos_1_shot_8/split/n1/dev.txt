symbolic_computation	under investigation in this paper is a (3 + 1)-dimensional variable-coefficient kadomtsev-petviashvili equation, which describes the propagation of surface and internal water waves. by virtue of the binary bell polynomials, symbolic computation and auxiliary independent variable, the bilinear forms, soliton solutions, backlund transformations and lax pair are obtained. variable coefficients of the equation can affect the solitonic structure, when they are specially chosen, while curved and linear solitons are illustrated. elastic collisions between/among two and three solitons are discussed, through which the solitons keep their original shapes invariant except for some phase shifts.
computer_vision	dual assignment clustering (dac) has been recently proposed in computer vision, shown to yield improved accuracy for action clustering tasks. the key idea of dac is to consider another view (different from the original features) for the same set of samples, and to exploit the statistical correlation between cluster assignments in two views. however, the existing optimization is heuristic, mainly due to the difficulty in combinatorial optimization for hard cluster assignment. in this paper, we introduce a novel dac optimization algorithm based on a probabilistic (soft) treatment, where the proposed objective function incorporates both the goodness of clustering in each view and the correlation between two views in a more principled and theoretically sound fashion. we also propose a lower-bound maximization technique that not only admits fast per-iteration solutions but also guarantees convergence to a local optimum. the superiority of the proposed approach to the existing methods is demonstrated for several activity video datasets.

computer_graphics	orientation and wayfinding in architectural immersive virtual environments (ives) are non-trivial, accompanying tasks which generally support the users' main task. world in miniatures (wims)-essentially 3d maps containing a scene replica-are an established approach to gain survey knowledge about the virtual world, as well as information about the user 's relation to it. however, for large-scale, information-rich scenes, scaling and occlusion issues result in diminishing returns. since there typically is a lack of standardized information regarding scene decompositions, presenting the inside of self-contained scene extracts is challenging. therefore, we present an automatic wim generation workflow for arbitrary, realistic in-and outdoor ives in order to support users with meaningfully selected and scaled extracts of the ive as well as corresponding context information. additionally, a 3d user interface is provided to manually manipulate the represented extract.
operating_systems	we describe the main features of the developed software tool, namely plate-motion 2.0 (pem2), which allows inferring the euler pole parameters by inverting the observed velocities at a set of sites located on a rigid block (inverse problem). pem2 allows also calculating the expected velocity value for any point located on the earth providing an euler pole (direct problem). pem2 is the updated version of a previous software tool initially developed for easy-to-use file exchange with the gamit/globk software package. the software tool is developed in matlab(a (r)) framework and, as the previous version, includes a set of matlab functions (m-files), guis (fig-files), map data files (mat-files) and user 's manual as well as some example input files. new changes in pem2 include (1) some bugs fixed, (2) improvements in the code, (3) improvements in statistical analysis, (4) new input/output file formats. in addition, pem2 can be now run under the majority of operating systems. the tool is open source and freely available for the scientific community.
machine_learning	cutting plane algorithm (cpa) is a generalization of iterative first-order gradient method, in which the objective function is approximated successively by supporting hyperplanes. cpa has been tailored to solve regularized loss minimization in machine learning by exploiting the regularization structure. in particular, for linear support vector machine (svm) embedding a line search procedure effectively remedies the fluctuations of function value and speeds up the convergence in practical issue. however, the existing line search strategy based on sorting algorithm takes o(mlogm) time. in this paper, we propose a more effective line search solver which spends only linear time. it can be extended to multiclass svm in which an optimized explicit piecewise linear function finding algorithm is prearranged. the total svm training time is proved to reduce theoretically and experiments consistently confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

data_structures	reaction mechanism generator (rmg) constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction steps using a general understanding of how molecules react. species thermochemistry is estimated through benson group additivity and reaction rate coefficients are estimated using a database of known rate rules and reaction templates. at its core, rmg relies on two fundamental data structures: graphs and trees. graphs are used to represent chemical structures, and trees are used to represent thermodynamic and kinetic data. models are generated using a rate-based algorithm which excludes species from the model based on reaction fluxes. rmg can generate reaction mechanisms for species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. it also has capabilities for estimating transport and solvation properties, and it automatically computes pressure-dependent rate coefficients and identifies chemically-activated reaction paths. rmg is an object-oriented program written in python, which provides a stable, robust programming architecture for developing an extensible and modular code base with a large suite of unit tests. computationally intensive functions are cythonized for speed improvements. program summary program title: rmg catalogue identifier: aezw_v1_0 program summary url: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/aezw_v1_0.html program obtainable from: cpc program library, queen 's university, belfast, n. ireland licensing provisions: mit/x11 license no. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 958681 no. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 9495441 distribution format: tar.gz programming language: python. computer: windows, ubuntu, and mac os computers with relevant compilers. operating system: unix/linux/windows. ram: 1 gb minimum, 16 gb or more for larger simulations classification: 16.12. external routines: rdkit, open babel, dassl, daspk, dqed, numpy, scipy nature of problem: automatic generation of chemical kinetic mechanisms for molecules containing c, h, 0, s, and n. solution method: rate-based algorithm adds most important species and reactions to a model, with rate constants derived from rate rules and other parameters estimated via group additivity methods. additional comments: the rmg software package also includes cantherm, a tool for computing the thermodynamic properties of chemical species and both high-pressure-limit and pressure-dependent rate coefficients for chemical reactions using results from quantum chemical calculations. cantherm is compatible with a variety of ab initio quantum chemistry software programs, including but not limited to gaussian, mopac, qchem, and molpro. running time: from 30 s for the simplest molecules, to up to several weeks, depending on the size of the molecule and the conditions of the reaction system chosen.

network_security	as computer networks are emerging in everyday life, network security has become an important issue. simultaneously, attacks are becoming more sophisticated, making the defense of computer networks increasingly difficult. attack graph is a modelling tool used in the assessment of security of enterprise networks. since its introduction a considerable amount of research effort has been spent in the development of theory and practices around the idea of attack graph. this paper presents a consolidated view of major attack graph generation and analysis techniques.
image_processing	a modified gaussian current density is put forward, which is used to simulate the dynamic process of az31b magnesium alloy double-electrode gas metal arc welding (de-gmaw) droplet transfer. the process of droplet transfer in the az31b magnesium alloy de-gmaw was simulated using fluent software. the influence of different bypass welding currents was investigated with a constant total current. the simulated results revealed that when the bypass current was 0 a, the process was the globular transfer type, the droplet transfer with a bypass current of 80 a was a projected transfer type and the droplet transfer at a bypass current of 170 a was a spray transfer type. the critical current is decreased so that spray transfer would occur at a lower current level in the de-gmaw process. as the bypass current was increased, the shape of droplet changed from oval to round and the transition frequency of the droplet increased in a stepwise fashion. to confirm the accuracy of the simulated results, welding experiments were performed and the image processing method was used to obtain the droplet size. the simulated and experimental results were found to be in good agreement.
parallel_computing	recently the hardware performance of mobile devices have been extremely increased and advanced mobile devices provide multi-cores and high clock speed. in addition, mobile devices have advantages in mobility and portability compared with pc and console, so many games and simulation programs have been developed under mobile environments. physically-based simulation is a one of the key issues for deformable object modeling which is widely used to represent the realistic expression of 3d soft objects with tetrahedrons for game and 3d simulation. however, it requires high computation power to plausibly and realistically represent the physical behaviors and interactions of deformable objects. in this paper, we implemented parallel cloth and mass-spring simulation using graphics processing unit (gpu) with opencl and multi-threaded central processing unit ( cpu) on a mobile device. we applied cpu and gpu parallel computing technique into spring force computation and integration methods such as euler, midpoint, 4th-order runge-kutta to optimize the computational burden of dynamic simulation. the integration methods compute the next step of positions and velocities in each node. in this paper, we tested the performance analysis for the spring force calculation and integration method process using cpu only, multi-threaded cpu, and gpu on mobile device respectively. our experimental results concluded that the calculation using proposed multi-threaded cpu and gpu multi-threaded cpu are much faster than using just the cpu only.
distributed_computing	cloud computing is one of the increasing technology that is connected with grid computing, utility computing, distributed computing. in today 's world, securing of data plays a vital role. in the computing environment, data privacy and data security is popular in fields like government, industry, and business for the future development. these are inter-related to both hardware and software. hence, this paper analyses the data security solutions in cloud computing.
algorithm_design	hadoop is one of the most important big data processing and storage systems. in recent years, a lot of efforts have been put to enhance hadoop 's performance from networking perspectives. however, there are limited tools that can help researchers to verify their networking algorithm design in terms of hadoop 's performance. this paper proposes doopnet which is a framework and toolset for creating hadoop clusters in a virtualized environment and for monitoring/analysing of hadoop 's networking characteristics under different network configurations. doopnet enables users to automatically set up a hadoop cluster over docker containers running inside mininet. the hadoop traffic is collected inside the containers and virtual switches through network flow monitors. the users can easily modify network topologies or configurations through mininet, observe the networking behaviour through network flow monitors, and analyse the effects of different network settings on hadoop 's performance. examples are presented to demonstrate how to setup the doopnet testbed and analyse hadoop traffic.
computer_programming	natural language processing (nlp) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. the idea of using a natural language for computer programming is to make it easier for people to talk to computers in their native tongue and spare them the pain of learning a computer friendly language like assembly, c, c++, java, lisp etc. among all the natural languages, sanskrit in its style is identified to be the best language which has minimum deviation. panini, the creator of sanskrit formulated 3,949 rules. this research paper explores varied distinctive features of al like nlp, semantic net, vibhakti, dual case, inflection based syntax etc. and how sanskrit effectively triumphs over these limitations and fulfills the prerequisites of a natural language processor.
relational_databases	intuitionistic fuzzy databases are used to handle imprecise and uncertain data as they represent the membership, nonmembership, and hesitancy associated with a certain element in a set. this paper presents the intuitionistic fuzzy fourth normal form to decompose the multivalued dependent data. a technique to determine intuitionistic fuzzy multivalued dependencies by working on the closure of dependencies has been proposed. we derive the closure by obtaining all the logically implied dependencies by a set of intuitionistic fuzzy multivalued dependencies, i.e., inference rules. a complete set of inference rules for the intuitionistic fuzzy multivalued dependencies has been given along with the derivation of each rule. these rules help us to compute the dependency closure and we further use the same for defining the intuitionistic fuzzy fourth normal form.
software_engineering	eliciting sufficient high-quality knowledge from individuals to build a robust and useful artificial intelligence or intelligent system solution is a very time-consuming and expensive activity, especially in domains where the knowledge is informal, partial, incomplete, implicit, tacit and unstructured. moreover, in order to develop a solution, a systematic way to incorporate the elicited knowledge into a specification is necessary. the goal of this thesis is to develop a strategy oriented to the transfer and transformation of knowledge with the aim of eliciting and structuring the most quantity of domain knowledge, either tacit or explicit; then incorporate it into a specification that covers the needs and expectations of domain specialists. the application of the strategy in real informally structured domain cases provides empirical insights about its usefulness and value.
bioinformatics	type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is characterized by islet beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance, which leads to an inability to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. circulating micrornas (mirnas) have been suggested as novel biomarkers for t2dm prediction or disease progression. however, mirnas and their roles in the pathogenesis of t2dm remain to be fully elucidated. in the present study, the serum mirna expression profiles of t2dm patients in chinese cohorts were examined. total rna was extracted from serum samples of 10 patients with t2dm and five healthy controls, and these was used in reverse-transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis with the exiqon pcr system of 384 serum/plasma mirnas. a total of seven mirnas were differentially expressed between the two groups (fold change >3 or < 0.33; p < 0.05). the serum expression levels of mir-455-5p, mir-454-3p, mir-144-3p and mir-96-5p were higher in patients with t2dm, compared with those of healthy subjects, however, the levels of mir-409-3p, mir-665 and mir-766-3p were lower. hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that it was possible to separate patients with t2dm and control individuals into their own similar categories by these differential mirnas. target prediction showed that 97 t2dm candidate genes were potentially modulated by these seven mirnas. kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis revealed that 24 pathways were enriched for these genes, and the majority of these pathways were enriched for the targets of induced and repressed mirnas, among which insulin, adipocytokine and t2dm pathways, and several cancer-associated pathways have been previously associated with t2dm. in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that serum mirnas may be novel biomarkers for t2dm and provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of t2dm.
cryptography	we propose an ultra-lightweight, compact, and low power block cipher boron. boron is a substitution and permutation based network, which operates on a 64-bit plain text and supports a key length of 128/80 bits. boron has a compact structure which requires 1939 gate equivalents (ges) for a 128-bit key and 1626 ges for an 80-bit key. the boron cipher includes shift operators, round permutation layers, and xor operations. its unique design helps generate a large number of active s-boxes in fewer rounds, which thwarts the linear and differential attacks on the cipher. boron shows good performance on both hardware and software platforms. boron consumes less power as compared to the lightweight cipher led and it has a higher throughput as compared to other existing sp network ciphers. we also present the security analysis of boron and its performance as an ultra-lightweight compact cipher. boron is a well-suited cipher design for applications where both a small footprint area and low power dissipation play a crucial role.
structured_storage	electronic storage of patient-related data will replace paper-based patient records in the near future. some steps in medical practice can even now not be achieved without electronic data processing. both systems, conventional paper-based and electronic-based records, have advantages and disadvantages which have to be taken into consideration. the advantages of electronic-based records are e.g. good availability of data, structured storage of data, scientific analysis of long-term data and possible data exchange with colleagues in the context of teleconsultation systems. problems have to be solved in the field of data security, initial high investment costs and time consumption in learning to use the system as well as in incompatibility of existing it systems.
