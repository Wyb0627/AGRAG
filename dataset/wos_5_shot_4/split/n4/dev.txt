molecular_biology	changes in the colonic microbiota are critical to the pathogenesis of diverticular complications such as diverticulitis and peridiverticular abscesses. however, more subtle changes in microbiota composition may well be important to the more chronic manifestations of diverticulosis. some studies have shown the presence of bacterial overgrowth in subgroups of patients with diverticular disease and recent studies, using molecular biology techniques, found an increase of proteobacteria and actinobacteria in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (sudd), compared with healthy controls. the use of probiotics to modulate intestinal microecology in sudd appears therefore rational. although several investigations evaluating the clinical efficacy of probiotics have been performed, no definitive results have yet been achieved, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the available studies. most of the studies used probiotics in combination with poorly absorbed antimicrobials or anti-inflammatory drugs. in only 4 studies, there was a harm using probiotics alone, but only 1 was a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. the analysis of the available evidence reveals a poor quality of the published studies, whose design was heterogeneous, with only 2 out of 11 trials being double-blind and randomized. therefore, available data can only suggest a benefit of probiotics in sudd, but do not allow any evidence-based definite conclusion. as a consequence, current guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for symptom relief in patients with diverticular disease.
molecular_biology	this report investigated the possible participation of canine distemper virus (cdv) in an eight-year-old, male, akita dog with neuromuscular disease. clinically, there was tetraparesis, muscular atrophy, generalized weakness, intolerance to exercise, and diminished or absent spinal reflexes. the dog was serologically negative for toxoplasma gondii. necropsy confirmed generalized muscular atrophy. histopathology revealed white matter demyelinating encephalitis, generalized atrophy and fibrosis of skeletal muscle fibers, myocardial atrophy and fibrosis, loss and demyelination of peripheral nerve fibers, axonal degeneration, endoneural fibrosis, and interstitial pneumonia. immunohistochemistry identified cdv antigens within the cerebellum, spinal cord, skeletal muscle, lungs, and spleen. rt-pcr and direct sequencing amplified the cdv nucleoprotein gene from the cerebellum and sciatic nerves. collectively, these findings suggest that this dog demonstrated systemic canine distemper that also affected the muscular system and probably triggered the manifestations of the neuromuscular disease observed in this case.

molecular_biology	lipid biosynthesis and its regulation have been studied mostly in the nonoleaginous yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae that serves as a model for eukaryotic cells. on the other hand, the yeast yarrowia lipolytica has been put forward as a model for oleaginous microorganisms because its genetics is known and tools for its genetic manipulation are becoming increasingly available. a comparison of the lipid biosynthetic pathways that function in these two microorganisms shows many similarities in key biosynthetic and regulatory steps. an example is the enzyme phosphatidic acid phosphatase that controls the synthesis of triacylglycerol (tag) in both yeasts. controlling the tag synthesis is crucial for metabolic engineering efforts that aim to increase the production of microbial lipids (i.e. single cell oils) because tag comprises the final product of these processes. at the same time the comparison reveals fundamental differences (e.g. in the generation of acetyl-coa for lipid biosynthesis) stemming from the oleaginous nature of y. lipolytica. these differences warranty more studies in y. lipolytica where the biochemistry and molecular biology of oleaginicity can be further explored.
molecular_biology	contemporary molecular biology research tools have enriched numerous areas of biomedical research that address challenging diseases, including endocrine cancers (pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, testicular, ovarian, and neuroendocrine cancers). these tools have placed several intriguing clues before the scientific community. endocrine cancers pose a major challenge in health care and research despite considerable attempts by researchers to understand their etiology. microarray analyses have provided gene signatures from many cells, tissues, and organs that can differentiate healthy states from diseased ones, and even show patterns that correlate with stages of a disease. microarray data can also elucidate the responses of endocrine tumors to therapeutic treatments. the rapid progress in next-generation sequencing methods has overcome many of the initial challenges of these technologies, and their advantages over microarray techniques have enabled them to emerge as valuable aids for clinical research applications (prognosis, identification of drug targets, etc.). a comprehensive review describing the recent advances in next-generation sequencing methods and their application in the evaluation of endocrine and endocrine-related cancers is lacking. the main purpose of this review is to illustrate the concepts that collectively constitute our current view of the possibilities offered by next-generation sequencing technological platforms, challenges to relevant applications, and perspectives on the future of clinical genetic testing of patients with endocrine tumors. we focus on recent discoveries in the use of next-generation sequencing methods for clinical diagnosis of endocrine tumors in patients and conclude with a discussion on persisting challenges and future objectives.
molecular_biology	although cancer outcome results from the interplay between genetics and environment, researchers are making a great effort for applying molecular biology in the prognostication of differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc). nevertheless, role of molecular characterisation in the prognostic setting of dtc is still nebulous. among the most common and well-characterised genetic alterations related to dtc, including mutations of braf and ras and ret rearrangements, braf(v600e) is the only mutation showing unequivocal association with clinical outcome. unfortunately, its accuracy is strongly limited by low specificity. recently, the introduction of next-generation sequencing techniques led to the identification of tert promoter and tp53 mutations in dtc. these genetic abnormalities may identify a small subgroup of tumours with highly aggressive behaviour, thus improving specificity of molecular prognostication. although knowledge of prognostic significance of tp53 mutations is still anecdotal, mutations of the tert promoter have showed clear association with clinical outcome. nevertheless, this genetic marker needs to be analysed according to a multigenetic model, as its prognostic effect becomes negligible when present in isolation. given that any genetic alteration has demonstrated, taken alone, enough specificity, the co-occurrence of driving mutations is emerging as an independent genetic signature of aggressiveness, with possible future application in clinical practice. dtc prognostication may be empowered in the near future by non-tissue molecular prognosticators, including circulating braf(v600e) and mirnas. although promising, use of these markers needs to be refined by the technical sight, and the actual prognostic value is still yet to be validated.
enzymology	increased interest in reduced and low sodium dairy foods generates flavor issues for cheeses. sodium is partly replaced with potassium or calcium to sustain the salty flavor perception, but the other cations may also alter metabolic routes and the resulting flavor development in aged cheeses. the effect of some cations on selected metabolic enzyme activity and on lactic acid bacterial physiology and enzymology has been documented. potassium, for example, is an activator of 40 enzymes and inhibits 25 enzymes. currently, we can visualize the effects of these cations only as lists inside metabolic databases such as metacyc. by visualizing the impact of these activating and inhibitory activities as biochemical pathways inside a metabolic database, we can understand their relevance, predict, and eventually dictate the aging process of cheeses with cations that replace sodium. as examples, we reconstructed new metabolic databases that illustrate the effect of potassium on flavor-related enzymes as microbial pathways. after metabolic reconstruction and analysis, we found that 153 pathways of lactic acid bacteria are affected due to enzymes likely to be activated or inactivated by potassium. these pathways are primarily linked to sugar metabolism, acid production, and amino acid biosynthesis and degradation that relate to cheddar cheese flavor.
enzymology	a variety of methods were developed to measure soil biological activity. all these methods are not suited to produce generally accepted results, but they give relative information about the ecological status of soil. soil enzymatic activity assays is only one way to measure the ecosystem status of soils. the technique is quite simple and produces reproducible results, and is nowadays of practical importance because the influence of agro-chemicals, industrial waste, heavy metals, as well as soil fertility management can be measured. especially the search for urease inhibitor is of particular interest in order to reduce ammonia losses from soils. soil enzymes have been reported as useful soil quality indicators due to their relationship to soil biology, being operationally practical, sensitive, integrative, ease to measure and described as ""biological fingerprints"" of past soil management, and relate to soil tillage and structure. the focus of this article is to provide a review of soil enzyme activity as a biological, process-level indicator for impacts of natural and anthropogenic activities on soils. this knowledge of soil enzymology can be applicable as bioindicator to human endeavour of ecosystem perturbation, agricultural practices and xenobiotic pollution.
enzymology	two 4-fluoro-l-glutamine diastereoisomers [(2s,4r)-4-fgln, (2s,4s)-4-fgln] were previously developed for positron emission tomography. label uptake into two tumor cell types was greater with, [f-18(2s,4r)-4-fgln than with [f-18](2s,4s)-4-fgln. in the present work we investigated the enzymology of two diastereoisomers of 4-fgln, two diastereoisomers of 4-fluoroglutamate (4-fglu) (potential metabolites of the 4-fgln diastereoisorners) and another fluoro-derivative of l-glutamine [(2s,4s)-4-(3-fluoropropyl) glutamine (fp-gln)]. the two 4-fglu diastereoisomers were found to be moderate-to-good substrates relative to l-glutamate of glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. additionally, alanine aminotransferase was shown to catalyze an unusual gamma-elimination reaction with both 4-fglu diastereoisomers. both 4-fglu diastereoisomers were shown to be poor substrates, but strong inhibitors of glutamine synthetase. both 4-fgln diastereoisomers were shown to be poor substrates compared to l-glutamine of glutamine transaminase l and alpha-arninoadipate aminotransferase. however, (2s,4r)-4-fgln was found to be a poor substrate of glutamine transaminase k, whereas (25,4s)-4-fgln was shown to be an excellent substrate. by contrast, fp-gln was found to be a poor substrate of all enzymes examined. evidently, substitution of h in position 4 by f in l-glutamine/l-glutamate has moderate-to-profound effects on enzyme-catalyzed reactions. the present results: 1) show that 4-fgin and 4-fglu diastereoisomers may be useful for studying active site topology of glutamate- and glutamine-utilizing enzymes; 2) provide a framework for understanding possible metabolic transformations in tumors of f-18-labeled (2s,4r)-4-fgln, (2s,4s)-4-fgln, (2s,4r)-4-fglu or (2s,4s)-4-fglu; and 3) show that [f-18]fp-gln is likely to be much less metabolically active in vivo than are the [f-18]-fgln diastereoisomers.

enzymology	malignant pleural mesothelioma (mpm) is a rare and aggressive tumor with generally disappointing results in terms of survival, however, there are occasional long-term survivors probably due to the biologic characteristics of the disease. standard uptake value (suv) of [f-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) evaluated by photon emission tomography (pet) is now widely accepted as an indicator of biologic behavior in several malignancies. the aim of this study was to verify whether suvmax and suvmean are inversely associated with the prognosis of patients with mpm and whether there was a correlation between grading/disease stage and suv value. patients with histologically proven mpm underwent integrated pet and computed tomography (ct) scanning. patients fasted and received 5.18 mbq of fdg per kilogram of body weight. based on the maximum chi-square method, a suvmax of 4.21 (range: 2.30-14.74) and a suvmean of 2.78 (range: 1.80-7.00) were used to classify patients as having a good or poor prognosis, respectively. from january 2004 to march 2010, 27 patients were analyzed: median age was 65 years (range: 54-77) and histologic mpm subtypes were epithelioid (23 patients) and biphasic (4 patients). at a median follow-up of 23 months (range: 1-52), there was no difference in median survival for either high or low suvmax [26 months (range: 11-not reached) vs. 19 months (range: 12-not reached); p = 0.811] or for high or low suvmean [26 months (range: 8-not reached) vs.19 months (range: 11-not reached); p = 0.831]. high suvmax (p = 0.018) was statistically correlated with high-stage disease. there was only a trend towards statistical significance between high-grade disease and high suvmean (p = 0.083); no such trend was found between advanced stages and suvmax (p = 0.268). we observed a significant correlation only between high suvmax and high-grade disease. no other relationships between suvmax and suvmean with biologic and clinical parameters were found. this is probably due to the patient characteristics and to the non-routine use of f-18-fdg pet/ct to stage rare tumors such as mpm.
enzymology	the establishment of posttranslational chromatin modifications is a major mechanism for regulating how genomic dna is utilized. however, current in vitro chromatin assays do not monitor histone modifications at individual nucleosomes. here we describe a strategy, nucleosome acetylation sequencing, that allows us to read the amount of modification at each nucleosome. in this approach, a bead-bound trinucleosome substrate is enzymatically acetylated with radiolabeled acetyl coa by the saga complex from saccharomyces cerevisae. the product is digested by restriction enzymes that cut at unique sites between the nucleosomes and then counted to quantify the extent of acetylation at each nucleosomal site. we find that we can sensitively, specifically, and reproducibly follow enzyme-mediated nucleosome acetylation. applying this strategy, when acetylation proceeds extensively, its distribution across nucleosomes is relatively uniform. however, when substrates are used that contain nucleosomes mutated at the major sites of saga-mediated acetylation, or that are studied under initial rate conditions, changes in the acetylation distribution can be observed. nucleosome acetylation sequencing should be applicable to analyzing a wide range of modifications. additionally, because our trinucleosomes synthesis strategy is highly modular and efficient, it can be used to generate nucleosomal systems in which nucleosome composition differs across the array.

southern_blotting	. haemophilia a (ha) is caused by widespread mutations in the factor viii gene. the high spontaneous mutation rate of this gene means that roughly 40% of ha mutations are private. this study aimed to describe the approaches used to confirm private disease-causing mutations in a cohort of belgian ha patients. we studied 148 unrelated ha families for the presence of intron 22 and intron 1 inversion by southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) assay was used to detect large genomic rearrangements. detection of point mutations was performed by dna sequencing. predicting the causal impact of new non-synonymous changes was studied by two general strategies: (i) molecular approaches such as family cosegregation, evaluation of the implicated codon based on phylogenic separated species and absence of the mutation in the general belgian population, and (ii) bioinformatics approaches to analyse the potential functional consequences of missense mutations. among the 148 ha patients, in addition to common intron 22 and intron 1 inversions as well as large deletions or duplications, 67 different point mutations were identified, of which 42 had been reported in the hamsters database, and 25 were novel including 10 null variants for which rna analyses confirmed the causal effect of mutations located in a splice site consensus and 15 missense mutations whose causality was demonstrated by molecular approaches and bioinformatics. this article reports several strategies to evaluate the deleterious consequences of unreported f8 substitutions in a large cohort of ha patients.
southern_blotting	in this article, i describe an animated slideshow of southern blotting that i have made freely available to other instructors. my hope is to provide a clear visualization of the logistics behind the technique so that instructors have a solid basis - as well as time freed up - to discuss its applications with students.
southern_blotting	sweet potato (ipomoea batatas l. cv. lizixiang) is a nutritious arable crop with a low drought tolerance during growth and maturation. the arabidopsis homeodomain glabrous 11 (hdg11) gene can increase drought tolerance in tobacco and tall fescue plants. to determine the effect of hdg11 in the sweet potato, transgenic plants that expressed the hdg11 gene were generated by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. expression of the transgene was confirmed using southern blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and dna sequencing. two independent hdg11 transgenic lines were evaluated and increased drought stress tolerance was observed in both lines, compared to wild-type (wt) plants. under drought stress conditions, net photosynthesis rate (p (n)), the efficiency of excitation energy captured by open psii reaction centers (f (v)/f (m)) and water use efficiency (wue) increased, and transpiration rate (t (r)) decreased in hdg11 transgenic plants compared to wt. hdg11 transgenic plants also had decreased lipid membrane oxidative damage, reduced h2o2 accumulation and increased ros-scavenging enzyme activity during drought stress treatment. this study indicates that overexpression of the arabidopsis hdg11 gene improved drought tolerance in the sweet potato.
southern_blotting	background: sialic acids are negatively charged nine carbon backbone sugars expressed on mammalian cell surfaces. sialic acids are part of a larger family of nonulosonic acid (nulo) molecules that includes pseudaminic and legionaminic acids. microbial expression of sialic acids and other nonulosonic acids has been shown to contribute to host-microbe interactions in a variety of contexts, including participation in colonization, immune subversion, and behaviors such as biofilm formation, autoagglutination and motility. previous research has suggested that some spirochetes may also express these molecules. results: here we use a combination of molecular tools to investigate the presence of nulo biosynthetic gene clusters among clinical and saprophytic isolates of the genus leptospira. polymerase chain reaction and southern blotting suggested that a variety of leptospires encoded nulo biosynthetic pathways. high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses provided biochemical evidence that di-n-acetylated nulo molecules are expressed at relatively high levels by l. interrogans serovar lai strain 55601, and at lower levels by l. alexanderi serovar manhao and l. fainei serovar hurstbridge. endogenous expression of n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac, the most common sialic acid) was documented in l. interrogans serovar copenhageni strain l1-130. neu5ac biosynthesis is also supported by a unique gene fusion event resulting in an enzyme with an n-terminal n-acetylneuraminic acid synthase domain and a c-terminal phosphatase domain. this gene fusion suggests that l. interrogans uses a neu5ac biosynthetic pathway more similar to animals than to other bacteria. analysis of the composition and phylogeny of putative nulo biosynthetic gene clusters in l. interrogans serovar lai and serovar copenhageni revealed that both strains have complete biosynthetic pathways for legionamimic acid synthesis, a molecule with the same stereochemistry as sialic acid. lectin-based affinity purification of nulo-modified molecules, followed by mass spectrometric identification suggests post-translational modification of surface lipoproteins, including loa22. conclusions: leptospira species encode nulo biosynthetic pathways and synthesize multiple nulo molecules including sialic acid. additional studies are needed to clarify the exact context and functional significance of nulo expression. these findings have implications for immune evasion during systemic leptospirosis.
southern_blotting	in order to investigate stability of the cry1ab gene and resistance in the t-1 generation of transgenic cotton (gossypium hirsutum var. coker 100), transgenic seeds were analyzed by pcr, southern and western blotting and bioassayed. seed samples from transgenic lines (t-0) along with seeds from non-transgenic lines s as control were used. pcr analysis showed the presence of cry1ab gene in 63 out of the 150 t-1 plants. integration of the cry1ab gene into the genome of transgenic plants was confirmed by southern blotting. western immunoblot analysis of transgenic plants revealed the presence of a band with mw of 67 kda using anti-cry1ab-polyclonal antiserum. bioassay tests indicated that the cry1ab protein was active and that the larvae died in the first days. significant differences were observed in the mortality rate, growth rate and extent of damage on the leaves between the transgenic and non-transgenic plants. the average mortality of the larvae in line 17 was 100%, in comparison with the control. these results indicated the relative advantage of line 17, which carries one copy of the cry1ab gene in comparison with the other lines.
northern_blotting	in whole cell patch-clamp recordings, we characterized the l-type ca2+ currents in bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (azf) cells and explored their role, along with the role of t-type channels, in acth- and angiotensin ii (ang ii)-stimulated cortisol secretion. two distinct dihydropyridine-sensitive l-type currents were identified, both of which were activated at relatively hyperpolarized potentials. one activated with rapid kinetics and, in conjunction with northern blotting and pcr, was determined to be ca(v)1.3. the other, expressed in approximately one-half of azf cells, activated with extremely slow voltage-dependent kinetics and combined properties not previously reported for an l-type ca2+ channel. the t-type ca2+ channel antagonist 3,5-dichloro-n-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (tta-p2) inhibited ca(v)3.2 current in these cells, as well as acth- and ang ii-stimulated cortisol secretion, at concentrations that did not affect l-type currents. in contrast, nifedipine specifically inhibited l-type currents and cortisol secretion, but less effectively than tta-p2. diphenylbutylpiperidine ca2+ antagonists, including pimozide, penfluridol, and fluspirilene, and the dihydropyridine niguldipine blocked ca(v)3.2 and l-type currents and inhibited acth-stimulated cortisol secretion with similar potency. this study shows that bovine azf cells express three ca2+ channels, the voltage-dependent gating and kinetics of which could orchestrate complex mechanisms linking peptide hormone receptors to cortisol secretion through action potentials or sustained depolarization. the function of the novel, slowly activating l-type channel is of particular interest in this respect. regardless, the well-correlated selective inhibition of t- and l-type currents and acth- and ang ii-stimulated cortisol secretion by tta-p2 and nifedipine establish the critical importance of these channels in azf cell physiology.
northern_blotting	background and objectives the mechanism of glucocorticoid -induced apoptosis is not fully understood and early predictive assays based on apoptotic markers for clinical outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) are scarce. the aim of this study was to characterize the involvement of bcl-2 family members and caspase activation in dexamethasone(dex)induced apoptosis in all. design and methods primary childhood all samples, the pre-b all cell line rs(4;11), and the t-all cell line ccrf-cem were used. the involvement of bcl-2 family members was evaluated by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and western and northern blotting. apoptosis was analyzed by annexin v and tmre staining. caspase activity was evaluated by a fluorometric assay. results dex induced significant down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members bcl-2 and bcl-xl, differential activation of the pro-apoptotic bak and bax, loss of delta psi m and cytochrome c release. dex-induced apoptosis also involved early activation of caspases 2 and -3. inhibition of caspase activity did not, however, protect against dex-induced bak/bax activation, loss of delta psi m or cell death. in 12 primary all samples dex-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of bax (p=0.045) and clown-regulation of bcl-2 (p=0.016) and/or bcl-xl (p=0.004). furthermore, ex vivo dex-sensitivity was associated with an early treatment response to polychemotherapy (p=0.026). interpretation and conclusions the differential regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members appears to be a key event in the execution of dex-induced apoptosis in all cell lines, and also indicates a role for these proteins in primary all cells.
northern_blotting	leptin is an adipocytokine that regulates body weight, and maintains energy homeostasis by promoting reduced food intake and increasing energy expenditure. leptin expression and secretion is regulated by various factors including hormones and fatty acids. butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that acts as source of energy in humans. we determined whether this fatty acid can play a role in leptin expression in fully differentiated human adipocytes. mature differentiated adipocytes were incubated with or without increasing concentrations of butyrate. rna was extracted and leptin mrna expression was examined by northern blot analysis. moreover, the cells were incubated with regulators that may affect signals which may alter leptin expression and analyzed with northern blotting. butyrate stimulated leptin expression, and stimulated mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) and phospho-creb signaling in a time-dependent manner. prior treatment of the cells with signal transduction inhibitors as pertusis toxin, g(i) protein antagonist, pd98059 (a mapk inhibitor), and wortmannin (a pi3k inhibitor) abolished leptin mrna expression. these results suggest that butyrate can regulate leptin expression in humans at the transcriptional level. this is accomplished by: 1) g(i) protein-coupled receptors specific for short-chain fatty acids, and 2) mapk and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (p13k) signaling pathways.
northern_blotting	development of a rapid and accurate quantification method for the detection of micrornas (mirnas) has been desired, in particular, when they are differently expressed in normal and pathological conditions. however, various methods for the quantification of small non-coding rnas as well as mirnas have been described. these methods mainly include hybridization-based approaches such as primer extension, northern blotting, microarray profiling, and reverse transcription (rt) pcr. here, we developed a simple and rapid method based on stem-loop primer-based real-time pcr assay for sensitive and accurate detection of mature mirnas. initially, a mirna-specific stem-loop rt primer is used for rt, which is followed by taqman real-time pcr assay using specific forward primer in combination with universal reverse primer and taqman probe. the assay has shown high sensitivity (a parts per thousand currency sign50 copies/reaction) for mirna detection in two breast cancer cell lines, mcf-7 and mda-mb-231. this assay might be implicated as a rapid and cost effective method for the detection of small non-coding rnas.
northern_blotting	the cdna amphip23,encoding an amphioxus p23, was identified from the gut cdna library of amphioxus branchiostoma belcheri. it contains a 513 bp open reading frame corresponding to a deduced protein of 170 amino acids. phylogenetic analysis shows that vertebrate and invertebrate p23/p23-like proteins are each grouped together, with amphip23 falling at the base of vertebrate p23/p23-like clade, suggesting that the divergence of vertebrate and invertebrate p23 genes probably occurs prior to the split of invertebrate/vertebrate from a common ancestor around 550 million years ago. northern blotting reveals a ubiquitous expression pattern of amphip23 in all adult tissues examined, while whole mount in situ hybridization demonstrates a tissue- and stage-specific expression pattern of amphip23 in developing embryos and larvae. presumably, the ubiquitous expression pattern of amphip23 in adult amphioxus represents the ancestral type of p23 gene prior to its split to human paralogs p23 and tsp23, while the tissue- and stage-specific expression pattern during early embryonic development implicates a role of amphip23 in anterior/posterior patterning.

human_metabolism	to better understand the interactions of the pathways of activation and detoxification on the metabolism of the putative carcinogen, phip, we administered a dose of 70-84 mu g [2-c-14] phip (17.5 mu ci c-14) 48-72 h before scheduled colon surgery. blood and urine collected for the next 48-72 h was evaluated by linear accelerator mass spectroscopy (ams) and scintillation counting lc-ms to identify specific phip metabolites. the thermostable phenol sulfotransferase (sult1a1) phenotype was correlated with the 4'-phip-so4 levels in the urine at 0-4 h (r = 0.86, p = 0.059). the cyp1a2 activity had a negative correlation with phip serum levels at 1 h (r = 0.94, p = 0.06) and a positive correlation with urine n-oh-phip levels at 0-4 h (r = 0.85, p = 0.15). this low level radioisotope method of determining the influence of phenotype on metabolism will significantly improve our understanding of the interrelationships of these pathways and provide a critical foundation for the development of individual risk assessment.

human_metabolism	purpose: to establish the cytochrome p450 (cyp) isozymes involved in the metabolism of the alkylating agent, thiotepa, to the pharmacologically active metabolite, tepa. methods: in vitro chemical inhibition studies were conducted by incubating thiotepa and pooled human hepatic microsomes in the presence of known inhibitors to cyp1a2, cyp2a6, cyp2c8, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, cyp2e1, and cyp3a4. studies were also performed with cloned, expressed cyp3a4, cyp2a6, cyp2e1 and cyp2b6 microsomes, and anti-cyp2b6 monoclonal antibody. results: known cyp3a4 inhibitors reduced tepa production. inhibition with cyp2e1 inhibitors was inconsistent. all other inhibitors produced little or no change in tepa formation. cloned, expressed cyp2b6 and cyp3a4 microsomes catalyzed tepa formation, whereas cyp2a6 and cyp2e1 did not. incubation of thiotepa with anti-cyp2b6 antibody and cloned, expressed cyp2b6 microsomes resulted in reductions in the formation of tepa, but no change in tepa formation occurred in human liver microsomes. conclusions: thiotepa is metabolized in human liver microsomes by cyp3a4 (major) and cyp2b6 (minor). there is a potential for cyp-mediated drug interactions with thiotepa. pharmacokinetic variability of thiotepa may be related to expression of hepatic cyp isozymes.
human_metabolism	background: the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol are produced in the colon by the action of bacteria on the plant precursor secoisolariciresinol diglycoside, which is found in high concentrations in flaxseed. objective: two experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether there is a dose response in urinary lignan excretion with increasing flaxseed intake, 2) whether flaxseed processing affects lignan excretion, 3) peak plasma lignan concentrations, and 4) plasma lignan concentrations after chronic supplementation. design: nine healthy young women supplemented their diets with 5, 15, or 25 g raw or 25 g processed (muffin or bread) flaxseed for 7 d during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycles. twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected at baseline and on the final day of supplementation. as an adjunct to the 25-g-flaxseed arm, subjects consumed the supplement for an additional day and blood and urine samples were collected at specific intervals. all blood and urine samples were analyzed for enterolactone and enterodiol by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. results: a dose-dependent urinary lignan response to raw flaxseed was observed (r = 0.72, p less than or equal to 0.001). the processing of flaxseed as a muffin or bread did not affect the quantity of lignan excretion. plasma lignan concentrations were greater (p less than or equal to 0.05) than baseline by 9 h after flaxseed ingestion (29.35 +/- 3.69 and 51.75 +/- 7.49 nmol/l, respectively). the total plasma area under the curve was higher on the eighth than on the first day (1840.15 +/- 343.02 and 1027.15 +/- 95.71 nmol.h/l, respectively). conclusion: mammalian lignan production from flaxseed precursors is dependent on time and dose but not on processing.
human_metabolism	endovascular stents have proven effective in treating coronary and peripheral arterial occlusions. since the first attempts, metals used to make these devices have been generally selected, and designed to be highly resistant to corrosion. therefore, as almost the totality of metallic biomaterials, they are implanted on a long-term basis. however, complications associated with permanent stents, such as instent restenosis and thrombosis, have often been reported. in order to reduce those complications, it would be clinically useful to develop a new family of degradable stents. an interesting material for fabrication of degradable stents is based on magnesium, an essential element involved in human metabolism. success in using magnesium alloys for the fabrication of endovascular devices is closely related to the properties of the selected alloy. in this context, a test bench was specifically designed to reproduce the physiological conditions to which stents are submitted when implanted in the coronary arteries. then the test bench was validated using a magnesium-based alloy. results showed that the corrosion rate and the corrosion mechanisms vary with the applied shear stress and that corrosion products strongly depend on the composition of the corrosive solution. this test bench will thus be useful in further investigations for the development of metallic alloys as degradable biomaterials.

human_metabolism	anthropogenic heat emissions (ahes) are a contributor to global climate change and may affect the climate and air quality in many ways. to gain a complete picture of ahes in mainland china and to lay the groundwork for modelling of regional climate and the environment, ahes from energy consumption and human metabolism were estimated, and an inventory was established with gridded distributions and profiles of temporal variations. this was based on the top-down inventory approach by using officially published statistical data. results indicated that total ahe of the mainland was 1.2x10(20)ja(-1), of which industry, transportation, buildings and human metabolism contributed 73.0, 11.6, 10.6 and 4.8%, respectively. coal and electricity accounted for approximately 74% of the total emissions from energy consumption. the annual average heat flux of the mainland was 0.4w m(-2), with a sharp difference between the eastern and western regions. fluxes in the eastern regions were mostly between 0.5 and 20w m(-2), and they were between 0 and 0.05w m(-2) in the western regions. in urban or built-up areas of typical cities, the heat fluxes may be much higher than the average for larger areas, typically ranging from 20 to 100w m(-2). region-specific profiles of temporal variations will improve the inventory in the future, which can be applied to climatic and environmental models to obtain in-depth knowledge of the effects of ahes.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the aim of this study was to characterize the ways of spreading of the most common bacterial species isolated from workers as well as from the air and raw materials at the workplaces in power plant utilizing biomass sources. to monitor microbial transmission and identify the source of contamination in the working environment, a combination of molecular and biochemical methods was applied. the study was carried out at workplaces in power plant utilizes biomass as a main fuel source. at each of the studied workplaces, bioaerosol particles were collected on sterile teflon filters using personal conical inhalable samplers (cis), and biomass samples (straw pellets and briquettes, corn briquettes, sunflower pellets and wood chips) were directly taken from their storage places. simultaneously with that, the swab samples from the hands of ten workers and their used respiratory masks (of ffp2 class) were also collected after the work shift to evaluate individual workers' microbial contamination. in all collected samples, total bacterial concentrations were assessed and the most common microbial isolates were identified to the species level using both biochemical (api tests) and molecular polymerase chain reaction (pcr), followed by random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd) typing methods. the mean concentrations of culturable bacteria in the air and in biomass samples at the studied workplaces were high, i.e. 1.2 x 10(6)cfu/m(3) and 3.8 x 10(4)cfu/g, respectively. the number of bacteria in the swab and mask samples also reached a high level of 1.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml and 1.9 x 10(3) cfu/cm(2), respectively. among the most frequently isolated microorganisms from all types of samples were gram-positive bacteria of the genus bacillus and staphylococcus xylosus. 37 bacterial strains belonging to the genus bacillus (b. licheniformis 8, b. pumilus 15 and b. subtilis 4) and staphylococcus (10) were genotyped by the rapd-pcr method. based on rapd-pcr analyses, the genomic similarity among 19 bacillus strains isolated from biomass, air, protective mask and hand samples as well as 6 s. xylosus strains isolated from air, mask and hand samples exceeded 80%. this study demonstrated that biomass is the primary source of bacteria at power plant workplaces. these results also revealed that biomass-associated bacteria can be easily transferred to workers' hands and mask during their routine activities. to improve health protection at the workplaces, adequate training courses on hand hygiene and how to use and remove respiratory masks correctly for workers should be introduced as a key element of the prevention strategy. from the occupational point of view, the pcr-based methods seem to be an efficient tool for a fast and precise typing of bacterial strains isolated from different sources in the occupational environment. such methods may help to implement appropriate prophylactic procedures and minimize transmission of infectious agents at workplaces.
polymerase_chain_reaction	replacement of beef by buffalo and vice versa is frequent in global markets, but their authentication is challenging in processed foods due to the fragmentation of most biomarkers including dna. the shortening of target sequences through use of two target sites might ameliorate assay reliability because it is highly unlikely that both targets will be lost during food processing. for the first time, we report a tetraplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay targeting two different dna regions in beef (106 and 120-bp) and buffalo (90 and 138-bp) mitochondrial genes to discriminate beef and buffalo in processed foods. all targets were stable under boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking conditions. a survey in malaysian markets revealed 71% beef curries contained buffalo but there was no buffalo in beef burgers. the assay detected down to 0.01 ng dna and 1% meat in admixed and burger products.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the objectives of this study were to determine the kinetic parameters of purified recombinant bla(mab) and bla(mmas) by spectrophotometry, analyze the genetic environment of the bla(mab) and bla(mmas) genes in both species by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, furthermore, in silico models of both enzymes in complex with imipenem were obtained by modeling tools. our results showed that bla(mab) and bla(mmas) have a similar hydrolysis behavior, displaying high catalytic efficiencies toward penams, cephalothin, and nitrocefin; none of the enzymes are well inhibited by clavulanate. bla(mmas) hydrolyzes imipenem at higher efficiency than cefotaxime and aztreonam. bla(mab) and bla(mmas) showed that their closest structural homologs are kpc-2 and sfc-1, which correlate to the mild carbapenemase activity toward imipenem observed at least for blammas. they also seem to differ from other class a -lactamases by the presence of a more flexible loop, which could impact in the hydrolysis efficiency against some antibiotics. a -35 consensus sequence (tcgaca) and embedded at the 3 end of mab_2874, which may constitute the bla(mab) and bla(mmas) promoter. our results suggest that the resistance mechanisms in fast-growing mycobacteria could be probably evolving toward the production of -lactamases that have improved catalytic efficiencies against some of the drugs commonly used for the treatment of mycobacterial infections, endangering the use of important drugs like the carbapenems.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: up-regulation of p-gp is an adaptive survival mechanism of cancer cells from chemotherapy. three new phytochemicals including two benzophenones, guttiferone k (gk) and oblongifolin c (oc), and a xanthone, isojacaruebin (iso), are potential anti-cancer agents. however, the capability of these compounds to increase multidrug-resistance (mdr) through p-gp up-regulation in cancer cells has not been reported. purpose: this study was to investigate the effects of gk, oc and iso on p-gp up-regulation in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (caco-2 cells). in addition, the mechanisms underlying their inductive effect were also determined. methods: the inductive effect of gk, oc and iso on p-gp expression at transcription level was measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. the reactive oxygen species production was determined by 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay. the protein content of p-gp and involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) pathway was evaluated by western blot analysis. results: gk, oc and iso (50 mu m, 24 h) were able to increase the amount of mdr1 mrna and protein in caco-2 cells. the presence of n-acetyl-l -cysteine significantly prevented the inductive effect of gk, oc and iso on mdr1 mrna level. moreover, mapk inhibitors including u0126 (an erk1/2/mapk inhibitor) and sb202190 (p38/mapk inhibitor) suppressed an increase of mdr1 mrna levels in the cells treated with benzophenones (gk, oc) and xanthone iso, respectively. these findings were in agreement with the increase of phosphorylated form of either erk1/2 (p-erk1/2) or p38 (p-p38) upon treatment of the cells with these three compounds. in addition, oc and iso, but not gk, increased mrna of c-jun level. conclusion: the benzophenones gk, oc and xanthone iso are likely mdr inducers through up-regulation of p-gp expression at transcription level. their molecular mechanisms involve oxidative stress-mediated activation of mapk signaling pathway.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the multidrug resistance 1 gene (mdr1) encodes for p-glycoprotein (p-gp), which plays a pathophysiological role in the development of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). herein, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mdr1 gene polymorphisms and sle susceptibility in the chinese guangxi population. the genotypes of rs1128503 and rs1045642 in mdr1 gene were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 283 sle patients and 247 healthy controls from guangxi. direct sequencing method was used to verify the results. binary logistic regression analyses adjusting for gender and age indicated that subjects carrying the rs1128503 t-allele and tt genotype were at increased risk of sle when compared to carriers of the c allele and cc genotype, with adjusted ors of 1.36 (95% ci 1.07-1.74; p = 0.014) and 1.77 (95% ci 1.08-2.88; p = 0.022), respectively. in addition, the risk allele t had a recessive effect (or 1.49, 95% ci 1.04-2.14, p = 0.029). subgroup analyses revealed effect modification by age for the presence of the rs1128503 t allele, yielding a significant positive association with sle in older (ae40 years) subjects (t vs. c allele: or 1.41, 95% ci 1.01-1.96; p = 0.041; tt vs. cc genotype: or 1.74, 95% ci 1.07-2.79; p = 0.021). for the first time, we demonstrated that mdr1 rs1128503 polymorphisms were associated with sle susceptibility in chinese guangxi population.
immunology	background: in october 2010, a pharmacist-driven stewardship program was implemented at the brigham and women 's hospital to ensure continued adherence to the prescribing guideline, focusing on indications for intravenous immune globulin (ivig) use and dosing per ideal body weight. objective: the primary objective was to describe an ivig stewardship program at a tertiary academic medical center. methods: this was a prospective, observational study from january 2013 through december 2014. all patients ordered to receive ivig during the defined study period were included. the intervention assessed describes a pharmacist-driven ivig stewardship program for medication approval. the primary end point was guideline compliance based on indication, dose, dosing weight, and frequency. secondary end points included the number of patients receiving ivig, indications, orders discontinued as a result of guideline nonadherence, and total amount dispensed. results: a total of 418 patients were identified during the study time frame. the top indications were: hypogammaglobulinemia in bone marrow transplantation and hematological malignancy (50.7%), acute solid organ rejection (11.8%), and immune thrombocytopenia with bleeding (10.1%). in all, 12 patients (2.9%) received ivig for an indication nonadherent with the ivig prescribing guideline; 9 patients (2.2%) and 2 patients (0.5%), respectively, received a different dose or frequency per the prescribed indication; and 12 orders (2.9%) for indications nonadherent to the guideline were discontinued. a total of 26033 g of ivig were dispensed during the study period. conclusions: an ivig stewardship program, including an institution-specific prescribing guideline and a pharmacist-driven stewardship program, may ensure guideline compliance for appropriateness of indication and dose at an academic medical center.
immunology	neurodegenerative diseases affect the neurons of the human brain and decline the neural activities causing neurocognitive dysfunctions and brain and behavioral disorders. an intensive immunotherapy is used to alter the course of multiple sclerosis, a common form of neurodegeneration, by controlling oxidative stress, recovering mitochondrial injury, and rehabilitating channelopathy dysfunctions. however, little is known about how the epigenetic factors can regulate atrophy genesis at hippocampal region, which prevents neurodegeneration. further, traumatic brain injury leads to neurodegeneration. however, the onset of the later is not yet successfully monitored. simultaneously, discrimination between neurodegeneration due to ageing and traumatic brain injury has not been addressed in the existing literature. therefore, we present different forms of traumatic brain injury that trigger neurotoxicity, leading to the classification of onset stage of neurodegenerative pathways. we discuss how the immune system orchestrates changes in neurogenesis in presence of physiological stimuli. in our view, the epigenetic mode of treatment successfully intervenes all forms of neurodegenerative disease in both ageing and traumatic condition. here, we establish a cross talk between epigenetic factors and neural immunology to balance oxidative stress at hippocampal regions.
immunology	the intestine displays an architecture of repetitive crypt structures consisting of different types of epithelial cells, lamina propia containing immune cells, and stroma. all of these heterogeneous cells contribute to intestinal homeostasis and participate in antimicrobial host defense. therefore, identifying a surrogate model for studying immune response and antimicrobial activity of the intestine in an in vitro setting is extremely challenging. in vitro studies using immortalized intestinal epithelial cell lines or even primary crypt organoid culture do not represent the exact physiology of normal intestine and its microenvironment. here, we discuss a method of culturing mouse colon tissue in a culture dish and how this ex vivo organ culture system can be implemented in studies related to antimicrobial host defense responses. in representative experiments, we showed that colons in organ culture express antimicrobial peptides in response to exogenous il-1 beta and il-18. further, the antimicrobial effector molecules produced by the colon tissues in the organ culture efficiently kill escherichia coli in vitro. this approach, therefore, can be utilized to dissect the role of pathogen-and danger-associated molecular patterns and their cellular receptors in regulating intestinal innate immune responses and antimicrobial host defense responses.
immunology	the widely-distributed north american species peromyscus leucopus and p. maniculatus of cricetine rodents are, between them, important natural reservoirs for several zoonotic diseases of humans: lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis, erhlichiosis, hard tickborne relapsing fever, powassan virus encephalitis, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and plague. while these infections are frequently disabling and sometimes fatal for humans, the peromyscines display little pathology and apparently suffer few consequences, even when prevalence of persistent infection in a population is high. while these peromyscus spp. are unable to clear some of the infections, they appear to have partial resistance, which limits the burden of the pathogen. in addition, they display traits of infection tolerance, which reduces the damage of the infection. research on these complementary resistance and tolerance phenomena in peromyscus has relevance both for disease control measures targeting natural reservoirs and for understanding the mechanisms of the comparatively greater sickness of many humans with these and other infections.

immunology	evidence suggests that exosomes can transfer genetic material between cells. however, their roles in hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection remain unclear. here, we report that exosomes present in the sera of chronic hepatitis b (chb) patients contained both hbv nucleic acids and hbv proteins, and transferred hbv to hepatocytes in an active manner. notably, hbv nucleic acids were detected in natural killer (nk) cells from both chb patients and healthy donors after exposure to hbv-positive exosomes. through real-time fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3', 3',-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfnate salt (did)-labeled exosomes were observed to interact with nk cells and to be taken up by nk cells, which was enhanced by transforming growth factor-beta treatment. furthermore, hbv-positive exosomes impaired nk-cell functions, including interferon (ifn)-gamma production, cytolytic activity, nk-cell proliferation and survival, as well as the responsiveness of the cells to poly (i: c) stimulation. hbv infection suppressed the expression of pattern-recognition receptors, especially retinoic acid inducible gene i (rig-i), on nk cells, resulting in the dampening of the nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappa b) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. our results highlight a previously unappreciated role of exosomes in hbv transmission and nk-cell dysfunction during chb infection. cellular & molecular immunology (2017) published online 30 may 2016
genetics	purpose of review lipoprotein(a) [lp(a)] is the strongest independent genetic risk factor for both myocardial infarction and aortic stenosis. it has also been associated with other forms of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (cvd) including ischemic stroke. its levels are genetically determined and remain fairly stable throughout life. elevated lp(a), above 50 mg/dl, affects one in five individuals worldwide. recent findings herein, we review the recent epidemiologic and genetic evidence supporting the causal role of lp(a) in cvd, highlight recommendations made by european and canadian guidelines regarding lp(a) and summarize the rapidly evolving field of lp(a)-lowering therapies including antisense therapies and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors. summary with novel therapies on the horizon, lp(a) is poised to gain significant clinical relevance and its lowering could have a significant impact on the burden of cvd.
genetics	urban areas are expanding worldwide, yet little is known how anthropogenic landscape fragmentation affects the connectedness and gene flow in urban wildlife. the european hedgehog (erinaceus europaeus) is a ground dwelling mammal which also inhabits variable urban habitats. we investigated habitat connectivity and the spatial genetic structure of urban hedgehogs in the largest swiss city. we addressed the following questions: i) at the city-scale, which prominent landscape elements affect the spatial distribution of genetic clusters? ii) which landscape elements affect gene flow in an urban mammal within the clusters? iii) does individual movement data improve the prediction of landscape-wide gene flow? we used two bayesian methods to examine the influence of water bodies and major traffic routes on genetic hedgehog clusters, using microsatellite data of 147 hedgehogs. further, we used extensive movement data to parameterise single-path and multi-path connectivity models, which were then used to predict genetic distance between hedgehog individuals. first, we found that both bayesian methods consistently showed three distinct genetic clusters, separated by the main rivers and the parallel running transportation axes. second, the best model indicates that gene flow was facilitated by urban green areas and hampered by all other land cover types. third, multi-path models based on detailed gps movement data clearly outperformed models based on a priori assumptions to predict gene flow. multi-path connectivity models based on movement data reveal to be a powerful tool to detect gene flow in highly fragmented habitats and could be a crucial step in implementing effective conservation measures.

genetics	we conducted comparative phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of plestiodon kishinouyei and p. stimpsonii, two sympatric skinks endemic to islands in the southern ryukyus, to explore different factors that have influenced population structure. previous phylogenetic studies using partial mitochondrial dna indicate similar divergence times from their respective closest relatives, suggesting that differences in population structure are driven by intrinsic attributes of either species rather than the common set of extrinsic factors that both presumably have been exposed to throughout their history. in this study, analysis of mtdna sequences and microsatellite polymorphism demonstrate contrasting patterns of phylogeography and population structure: p. kishinouyei exhibits a lower genetic variability and lower genetic differentiation among islands than p. stimpsonii, consistent with recent population expansion. however, historical demographic analyses indicate that the relatively high genetic uniformity in p. kishinouyei is not attributable to recent expansion. we detected significant isolation-by-distance patterns among p. kishinouyei populations on the land bridge islands, but not among p. stimpsonii populations occurring on those same islands. our results suggest that p. kishinouyei populations have maintained gene flows across islands until recently, probably via ephemeral quaternary land bridges. the lower genetic variability in p. kishinouyei may also indicate smaller effective population sizes on average than that of p. stimpsonii. we interpret these differences as a consequence of ecological divergence between the two species, primarily in trophic level and habitat preference.
genetics	megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (mmihs) is a congenital visceral myopathy characterized by severe dilation of the urinary bladder and defective intestinal motility. the genetic basis of mmihs has been ascribed to spontaneous and autosomal dominant mutations in actin gamma 2 (actg2), a smooth muscle contractile gene. however, evidence suggesting a recessive origin of the disease also exists. using combined homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing, a genetically isolated family was found to carry a premature termination codon in leiomodin1 (lmod1), a gene preferentially expressed in vascular and visceral smooth muscle cells. parents heterozygous for the mutation exhibited no abnormalities, but a child homozygous for the premature termination codon displayed symptoms consistent with mmihs. we used crispr-cas9 (crispr-associated protein) genome editing of lmod1 to generate a similar premature termination codon. mice homozygous for the mutation showed loss of lmod1 protein and pathology consistent with mmihs, including late gestation expansion of the bladder, hydronephrosis, and rapid demise after parturition. loss of lmod1 resulted in a reduction of filamentous actin, elongated cytoskeletal dense bodies, and impaired intestinal smooth muscle contractility. these results define lmod1 as a disease gene for mmihs and suggest its role in establishing normal smooth muscle cytoskeletal-contractile coupling.
genetics	translation initiation in eukaryotes and archaea involves a methionylated initiator trna delivered to the ribosome in a ternary complex with e/aif2 and gtp. eukaryotic and archaeal initiator trnas contain a highly conserved a(1)-u-72 base pair at the top of the acceptor stem. the importance of this base pair to discriminate initiator trnas from elongator trnas has been established previously using genetics and biochemistry. however, no structural data illustrating how the a(1)-u-72 base pair participates in the accurate selection of the initiator trnas by the translation initiation systems are available. here, we describe the crystal structure of a mutant e. coil initiator trna(f)(met)a(1)-u-72, aminoacylated with methionine, in which the cl: a(72) mismatch at the end of the trna acceptor stem has been changed to an a(1)-u-72 base pair. sequence alignments show that the mutant e. coli trna is a good mimic of archaeal initiator trnas. the crystal structure, determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution, shows that the a(1)-u-72 pair adopts an unusual arrangement. a(1) is in a syn conformation and forms a single h-bond interaction with u-72. this interaction requires protonation of the n1 atom of a(1). moreover, the 5' phosphoryl group folds back into the major groove of the acceptor stem and interacts with the n-7 atom of g(2). a possible role of this unusual geometry of the a(1)-u-72 pair in the recognition of the initiator trna by its partners during eukaryotic and archaeal translation initiation is discussed.
cell_biology	the generation of axon collateral branches is a fundamental aspect of the development of the nervous system and the response of axons to injury. although much has been discovered about the signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics underlying branching, additional aspects of the cell biology of axon branching have received less attention. this review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of key factors involved in axon branching. this article focuses on how cytoskeletal mechanisms, intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane remodeling (exocytosis and endocytosis) contribute to branch initiation and formation. together this growing literature provides valuable insight as well as a platform for continued investigation into how multiple aspects of axonal cell biology are spatially and temporally orchestrated to give rise to axon branches.

cell_biology	nanovesicles (similar to 100 nm) are ubiquitous in cell biology and an important vector for drug delivery. mechanical properties of vesicles are known to influence cellular uptake, but the mechanism by which deformation dynamics affect internalization is poorly understood. this is partly due to the fact that experimental studies of the mechanics of such vesicles remain challenging, particularly at the nanometer scale where appropriate theoretical models have also been lacking. here, we probe the mechanical properties of nanoscale liposomes using atomic force microscopy (afm) indentation. the mechanical response of the nanovesicles shows initial linear behavior and subsequent flattening corresponding to inward tether formation. we derive a quantitative model, including the competing effects of internal pressure and membrane bending, that corresponds well to these experimental observations. our results are consistent with a bending modulus of the lipid bilayer of similar to 1.4k(b)t. surprisingly, we find that vesicle stiffness is pressure dominated for adherent vesicles under physiological conditions. our experimental method and quantitative theory represents a robust approach to study the mechanics of nanoscale vesicles, which are abundant in biology, as well as being of interest for the rational design of liposomal vectors for drug delivery.
cell_biology	background: recent experiments regarding ndc80/hec1 in force generation at kinetochores for chromosome motions have prompted speculation about possible models for interactions between positively charged molecules at kinetochores and negative charge at and near the plus ends of microtubules. discussion: a clear picture of how kinetochores and centrosomes establish and maintain a dynamic coupling to microtubules for force generation during the complex motions of mitosis remains elusive. the current paradigm of molecular cell biology requires that specific molecules, or molecular geometries, for force generation be identified. however, it is possible to explain several different mitotic motions-including poleward force production at kinetochores-within a classical electrostatics approach in terms of experimentally known charge distributions, modeled as surface and volume bound charges interacting over nanometer distances. conclusion: we propose here that implicating ndc80/hec1 as a bound volume positive charge distribution in electrostatic generation of poleward force at kinetochores is most consistent with a wide range of experimental observations on mitotic motions, including polar production of poleward force and chromosome congression.
cell_biology	multicellular spheroids have been studied in the fields of oncology, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering. in this study, we found a new polymer material for thermo-controlled spheroid/monolayer cell culture switching. the polymers that have pendant ureido groups (ureido polymers) exhibited upper critical solution temperature-type phase separation behavior. cells in monolayer culture were converted to spheroids by the addition of ureido polymers below phase separation temperature (t-p). time-lapse observations indicated that cells began to migrate and aggregate to form the spheroids to avoid contact with phase separated polymer (coacervates) on the surface of the culture dish. we supposed that the coacervates seemingly suppressed interaction between cell and the dish surface or extracellular matrices. by increasing culture temperature above t-p, the spheroids began to collapse into a monolayer of cells due to dissolution of the coacervates. these results indicated that cell morphology could be repeatedly switched by changing the culture temperature in the presence of ureido polymers.
cell_biology	studying cell differentiation and transformation allows a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the initiation and the evolution of cancer. the role of proteins which participate in these processes is dependent on their location within the cell. determining the subcellular localization of proteins or the changes in localization is, therefore, paramount in elucidating their role. using quantitative mass spectrometry, we characterized the protein expression and subcellular localization of nearly 5000 proteins from seven different colorectal cancer (crc) cell lines, as well as normal colon fibroblasts and intestinal epithelial cells. this cellular characterization allowed the identification of colon cancer-associated proteins with differential expression patterns as well as deregulated protein networks and pathways. indeed, our results demonstrate differential expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, and transcription in colon cancer cells compared to normal colon-derived cells. pathway analyses identified different cellular functions, including endocytosis and eif2 signaling, whose deregulation correlates with mutations found in the different crc phenotypes. our results provide an unbiased, quantitative and high-throughput approach to measure changes in protein expression and subcellular protein locations in different crc cell lines.
fluid_mechanics	varicocele has been associated with reduced male reproductive potential. with the advances in biomolecular techniques, it has been possible to better understand the mechanisms involved in testicular damage provoked by varicocele. current evidence suggests the central role of reactive oxygen species (ros) and the resultant oxidative stress (os) in the pathogenesis of varicocele-associated male subfertility although the mechanisms have not yet been fully described and it is likely to be multifactorial. excessive ros is associated with sperm dna fragmentation, which may mediate the clinical manifestation of poor sperm function and fertilization outcome related to varicocele. testing of ros/os and dna fragmentation has the potential to provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information compared to conventional semen analysis and may guide therapeutic management strategies in individual patient.
fluid_mechanics	in water treatment, flocculation creates aggregated particles or flocs large enough to be removed by downstream processes of sedimentation and filtration. fluidized beds of flocs (floc blankets) are sometimes included in upflow sedimentation processes because they can significantly improve sedimentation tank particle removal when plate or tube settlers are used. overall performance of a sedimentation tank containing a floc blanket is influenced by the characteristics of incoming flocs fromthe flocculator. floc blankets provide an additional opportunity for aggregation of colloidal particles that enables a reduction in the size of the flocculators, while improving particle removal efficiency. in this study, laminar flow flocculators varying in velocity gradient (g) and residence time (theta) were tested in a laboratory scale water treatment systemwith a floc blanket. results indicate that increasing g (range of 74-251 s(-1)), while decreasing residence time from 269 to 80 s, and maintaining a constant g theta (similar to 20,000) improved particle removal. these results indicate that velocity gradients greater than existing design recommendations may be used to reduce flocculator residence times (and associated construction costs) when upflow sedimentation with a floc blanket and overlying lamellar plate or tube settlers are employed subsequent to flocculation. further reduction of the residence time to 24 s with a g of 251 s(-1) resulted in a settled water turbidity of 14 nephelometric turbidity unit (ntu). when varying theta at a constant g of 72 s(-1), an apparentminimum in settled effluent turbidity at 0.15 ntu was observed at the middle residence time tested (theta = 211 s), suggesting that long hydraulic flocculator residence times may be suboptimal.
fluid_mechanics	the feasibility of using a thermomagnetically pumped ferrofluid to enhance the performance of a natural convection cooling loop is investigated. first, a simplified analytical estimate for the thermomagnetic pumping action is derived, and then design rules for optimal solenoid and ferrofluid are presented. the design rules are used to set up a medium-scale (1 m, 10-1000 w) case study, which is modeled using a previously published and validated model (aursand et al. [1]). the results show that the thermomagnetic driving force is significant compared to the natural convection driving force, and may in some cases greatly surpass it. the results also indicate that cooling performance can be increased by factors up to 4 and 2 in the single-phase and two-phase regimes, respectively, even when taking into the account the added heat from the solenoid. the performance increases can alternatively be used to obtain a reduction in heat-sink size by up to 75%.

fluid_mechanics	the present contribution is a significant extension of the work by kelbin et al. (j. fluid mech., vol. 721, 2013, pp. 340-366) as a new time-dependent helical coordinate system has been introduced. for this, lie symmetry methods have been employed such that the spatial dependence of the originally three independent variables is reduced by one and the remaining variables are: the cylindrical radius r and the time- dependent helical variable xi = (z/alpha(t)) + b phi, b = const. and time t. the variables z and pi are the usual cylindrical coordinates and alpha(t) is an arbitrary function of time t. assuming alpha = const., we retain the classical helically symmetric case. using this, and imposing helical invariance onto the equation of motion, leads to a helically symmetric system of euler and navier-stokes equations with a time-dependent pitch alpha(t), which may be varied arbitrarily and which is explicitly contained in all of the latter equations. this has been conducted both for primitive variables as well as for the vorticity formulation. hence a significantly extended set of helically invariant flows may be considered, which may be altered by an external time-dependent strain along the axis of the helix. finally, we sought new conservation laws which can be found from the helically invariant euler and navier-stokes equations derived herein. most of these new conservation laws are considerable extensions of existing conservation laws for helical flows at a constant pitch. interestingly enough, certain classical conservation laws do not admit extensions in the new time-dependent coordinate system.
fluid_mechanics	in this paper, we present an overview of the entropy production in fluid dynamics in a systematic way. first of all, we clarify a rigorous derivation of the incompressible limit for the navier-stokes-fourier system of equations based on the asymptotic analysis, which is a very well known mathematical technique used to derive macroscopic limits of kinetic equations (chapman-enskog expansion and hilbert expansion are popular methodologies). this allows to overcome the theoretical limits of assuming that the material derivative of the density simply vanishes. moreover, we show that the fundamental gibbs relation in classical thermodynamics can be applied to non-equilibrium flows for generalizing the entropy and for expressing the second law of thermodynamics in case of both incompressible and compressible flows. this is consistent with the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and it is an essential condition for the design and optimization of fluid flow devices. summarizing a theoretical framework valid at different regimes (both incompressible and compressible) sheds light on entropy production in fluid mechanics, with broad implications in applied mechanics.
hydraulics	the stars project at the paul scherrer institut (psi) has adopted the trace thermal-hydraulic code. for analyses involving interactions between system and core, a coupling of trace with the simulate-3k (s3k) light water reactor (lwr) core simulator has been developed. in this configuration, the codes and associated simulation models play a central role to achieve a comprehensive safety analysis capability. therefore, efforts have now been undertaken to consolidate the validation strategy by implementing a more rigorous and structured assessment approach for trace applications. the principle is to systematically track the evolution of a given set of predicted physical quantities of interest (qois) over a multidimensional parametric space. if properly set up, such environment should provide code developers and code users with persistent (less affected by user effect) and quantified information (sensitivity of qois) on the applicability of a simulation scheme (codes, methodology, and input models) for steady-state and transient analysis of full lwr systems. through this, for each given transient/accident, critical paths of the validation process can be identified that could then translate into defining reference schemes to be applied for downstream predictive simulations. to illustrate this approach, this validation strategy is applied to an inadvertent blowdown event that occurred in a swiss bwr/6. the transient was initiated by the spurious actuation of the automatic depressurization system. here, the validation approach progresses through a number of dimensions: (a) different versions of the trace code; (b) the methodology dimension-in this case imposed power and updated trace core models are investigated; and (c) the nodalization dimension, where changes to the input model are assessed. for each step in each validation dimension, a common set of qois is investigated. for the steady-state results, these include fuel temperature distributions. for the transient part of the present study, the evaluated qois include the system pressure evolution and water carryover into the steam line. it has been seen that the improvements to the model predictions resulted in a small impact on the system pressure gradient, thus confirming a persistency of the downstream mechanical stress estimate, whereas the water carryover could vary by up to 150% as a function of the adopted simulation methodology.
hydraulics	the thermal-hydraulic response of large dry pressurized water reactor containments under loss-of-coolant-accident conditions-particularly with respect to containment pressure and sump pool temperature-is crucial for risk-informed decision making about generic safety issue 191. texas a& m university has developed models with several computer codes including melcor and gothic to model such scenarios. melcor is a best-estimate thermal-hydraulic and severe accident code created and actively maintained by sandia national laboratories for the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission. gothic is a thermal-hydraulic software package meant for design, licensing, and safety calculations for, among other systems, nuclear power plant containments. it was developed and is maintained by numerical applications inc. for the electronic power research institute. the overarching goal of the analyses presented here is twofold: (1) produce best-estimate time profiles of sump pool temperature under double-ended guillotine-break conditions with melcor and gothic and (2) investigate differences between the melcor and gothic code results via a sensitivity study. the sump pool temperature was selected as a key parameter to compare because it has direct implications for sump pool chemistry, residual heat removal during recirculation, and pressure drop across sump screens. aspects of the melcor and gothic modeling strategies are discussed, and best estimates of the containment thermal-hydraulic response are presented. there are significant disagreements between code predictions. hypotheses to explain the differences are tested through a comparative code sensitivity study. in this context, ""sensitivity"" refers to how containment thermal hydraulics respond to differences in code inputs or code phenomenological models. sensitivity calculations are performed to exclude, individually, the model effects on comparative thermal-hydraulic responses of containment fan coolers, containment sprays, thermal surface condensation/films, and break source definition. calculations are also performed with multiple models excluded. using containment sump pool temperature as an indicator, the most impactful physics in terms of code agreement are those of thermal surfaces (condensation, film phenomena) whereas fan cooler models have a minimal effect. containment spray exclusion results in disagreement in parts of the event sequence, while break source definition and/or break effluent flashing models lead to disagreement.
hydraulics	the importance of conceptualizing the dynamics of storage-driven saturation area connectivity in runoff generation has been central to the development of topmodel and similar low parameterized rainfall-runoff models. in this contribution, we show how we developed a 40-year hydrometric data base to simulate storage-discharge relationships in the girnock catchment in the scottish highlands using a simple conceptual model. the catchment is a unique fisheries reference site where atlantic salmon populations have been monitored since 1966. the modelling allowed us to track storage dynamics in hillslopes, the riparian zone and groundwater, and explicitly link non-linear changes of streamflows to landscape storage and connectivity dynamics. this provides a fundamental basis for understanding how the landscape and riverscape are hydrologically connected and how this regulates in-stream hydraulic conditions that directly influence salmonids. we use the model to simulate storage and discharge dynamics over the 40-year period of fisheries records. the modelled storage-driven connectivity provides an ecohydological context for understanding the dynamics in stream flow generation which determine habitat hydraulics for different life stages of salmon population. this new, long-term modelling now sets this variability in the riverscape in a more fundamental context of the inter-relationships between storage in the landscape and stream flow generation. this provides a simple, robust framework for future ecohydrological modelling at this site, which is an alternative to more increasingly popular but highly parameterized and uncertain commercial ecohydrological models. it also provides a wider, novel context that is a prerequisite for any model-based scenario assessment of likely impacts resulting from climate or land use change. copyright (c) 2016 the authors hydrological processes published by john wiley & sons ltd. copyright (c) 2016 the authors hydrological processes published by john wiley & sons ltd.
hydraulics	submerged aquatic vegetation affects flow, sediment and ecological processes within rivers. quantifying these effects is key to effective river management. despite a wealth of research into vegetated flows, the detailed flow characteristics around real plants in natural channels are still poorly understood. here we present a new methodology for representing vegetation patches within computational fluid dynamics (cfd) models of vegetated channels. vegetation is represented using a mass flux scaling algorithm (mfsa) and drag term within the reynolds-averaged navier-stokes equations, which account for the mass and momentum effects of the vegetation, respectively. the model is applied using three different grid resolutions (0.2, 0.1 and 0.05m) using time-averaged solution methods and compared to field data. the results show that the model reproduces the complex spatial flow heterogeneity within the channel and that increasing the resolution leads to enhanced model accuracy. future applications of the model to the prediction of channel roughness, sedimentation and key eco-hydraulic variables are presented, likely to be valuable for informing effective river management.

hydraulics	biofilms are ubiquitous in the pipes of drinking water distribution systems (dwdss), and recent experimental studies revealed that the chlorination of the microbial carbon associated with the biofilm contributes to the total disinfection by-products (dbps) formation with distinct mechanisms from those formed from precursors derived from natural organic matter (nom). a multiple species reactive transport model was developed to explain the role of biofilms in dbps formation by accounting for the simultaneous transport and interactions of disinfectants, organic compounds, and biomass. using parameter values from experimental studies in the literature, the model equations were solved to predict chlorine decay and microbial regrowth dynamics in an actual dwds, and trihalomethanes (thms) formation in a pilot-scale distribution system simulator. the model 's capability of reproducing the measured concentrations of free chlorine, suspended biomass, and thms under different hydrodynamic and temperature conditions was demonstrated. the contribution of bacteria-derived precursors to the total thms production was found to have a significant dependence on the system 's hydraulics, seasonal variables, and the quality of the treated drinking water. under system conditions that promoted fast bacterial re-growth, the transformation of non-microbial into microbial carbon dbp precursors by the biofilms showed a noticeable effect on the kinetics of thms formation, especially when a high initial chlorine dose was applied. these conditions included elevated water temperature and high concentrations of nutrients in the influent water. the fraction of thms formed from microbial sources was found to reach a peak of 12% of the total produced thms under the investigated scenarios. the results demonstrated the importance of integrating bacterial regrowth dynamics in predictive dbps formation models.

computer-aided_design	in thiswork, a molecular dynamics simulationmethodwas introduced to compute the preassembled system of molecular imprinted polymers for sulfamethoxazole monomer. the results revealed that the ratio of sulfamethoxazole as template molecule to 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane as functional monomer to tetraethylorthosilicate as cross-linker of 10: 10: 40 led to themost stable template-functionalmonomer cluster. based on the result of computational simulation, cdte@sio2 core-shell imprinted polymers, a cadmium telluride quantum dots layer on the surface of aminofunctionalized sio2, were synthesized as the fluorescent sensor. then, a series of measures were used to characterize the structure and morphology to get optimal sensors. the concentration range was 5.0-30.0 mu mol/l between molecular imprinted polymers at cdte at sio2, and sulfamethoxazole of the fluorescence intensity. to further verify the reliability and accuracy of the fluorescent sensor, the application was successfully by analyzing sulfamethoxazole in pure milk and lake water. the results showed the recoveries were above 96.89% with a relative standard deviation of 1.25-5.45%, and the fluorescence sensor with selective recognition provides an alternative solution for the determination of sulfamethoxazole.
computer-aided_design	reverse engineering demands a fast and accurate measuring method to obtain the surface model of an object when its computer-aided design (cad) model is not available. blending the advantages of both contact probes and non-contact scanners has been the trend of reverse engineering development for the past 15 years. current research on hybrid reverse engineering system focuses on sensor selection, scanning path planning, and coordinate system registration and unification, but lacks of interaction between the data groups from the touch probe and laser sensor. the objective of this research is directed toward improving data accuracy at a reduced amount of data points without complex instrument integration and is accomplished through combining the advantages of contact probes and non-contact scanners and meanwhile offsetting their disadvantages. in this research, data from the laser sensor is strategically selected based on the local surface variation, and a coordinate measuring machine (cmm) touch probe is used to enhance data accuracy. a cell merging algorithm is implemented to reduce the amount of data based on a newly proposed concept of break points, by which a hermit bicubic relation is maintained among neighboring sampling points while a hybrid reverse engineering process is going on. at the end of the paper, examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the methodology.

computer-aided_design	ingaas (and its variant) appears to be a promising channel material for high-performance, low-power scaled cmos applications due to its excellent carrier transport properties. however, mos transistors made of this suffer from poor electrostatic integrity. in this work, we consider an underlap ultra thin body (utb) inas-on-insulator n-channel mos transistor, and study the effect of varying the gate-source/drain (g-s/d) underlap length on the analog performance of the device with the help of technology computer-aided design (tcad) simulation, calibrated with schrodinger-poisson solver and experimental results. the underlap technique improves the gate electrostatic integrity which in turn improves the analog performance. we develop a non-quasi-static (nqs) small signal equivalent circuit model of the device which is used for study of the rf performance. with increase of the underlap length, the unity gain cut-off frequency degrades and the maximum oscillation frequency improves beyond a certain value of the underlap length. we further study the gain-frequency response of a common source amplifier using the nqs model, through spice simulation and observe that the voltage gain and the gain bandwidth improves.

manufacturing_engineering	the development of computer aided resources in automation of generation of manufacturing routings and operations is being mainly accomplished through the search of similarities between existent ones, resulting standard process routings that are grouped by analysis of similarities between parts or routings. this article proposes the development of manufacturing routings and operations detailment using a methodology which steps will define the initial, intermediate and final operations, starting from the rough piece and going up to the final specifications, that must have binunivocal relationship with the part design specifications. each step will use the so called rules of precedence to link and chain the routing operations. the rules of precedence order and prioritize the knowledge of various manufacturing processes, taking in account the theories of machining, forging, assembly,and heat treatments; also, utilizes the theories of accumulation of tolerances and process capabilities, between others. it is also reinforced the availability of manufacturing databases related to process tolerances, deviations of machine tool- cutting tool- fixturing devices - workpiece,and process capabilities. the statement and application of rules of precedence, linking and joining manufacturing concepts in a logical and structured way, and their application in the methodology steps will make viable the utilization of structured knowledge instead of tacit one currently available in the manufacturing engineering departments, in the generation of manufacturing routing and operations. consequently, the development of computer aided in process planning will be facilitated, due to the structured knowledge applied with this methodology.
manufacturing_engineering	although the system reliability theory has a high capability in quality quantification, while system reliability optimization (sro) has been well developed in manufacturing engineering, seldom can their applications be found in the construction industry. this study aims to develop a system reliability theory based multiple-objective optimization model to conduct sro, and then identify the cost-quality trade-off solution for construction projects. first the whole construction project is treated as a system composed of different work packages. second, the reliability function is employed to quantify the quality performance and the nonlinear cost-reliability function is set up. moreover, according to the physical arrangements among each work package, the system reliability structural function is determined. third, the total construction cost minimization and system reliability maximization are defined as multiple-objectives. the particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to search for the pareto-optimal solutions, from which the final cost-quality trade-off solution can be selected. a real construction case is used to evaluate the workability of the proposed model and the results have fully proven its validity and practicality.

manufacturing_engineering	in manufacturing engineering, especially in machining process, the definition of a reference plane is the first essential step within the overall process. after the reference plane is applied at the component all other features are processed with reference to this basic plane. during any process the component has to be clamped in order to resist the processing forces. there are several clamping systems available, such as pneumatic, magnetic systems or magneto-rheological (mr) systems. depending on its stiffness the component is deformed due to the clamping forces, stresses are introduced. this effect can be neglected for components with a high stiffness and nearly rigid body behaviour. however, the deformation of low stiff components under clamping forces, e.g. sheet metals, is relatively large and is in the same range as the addressed accuracy of machining process. due to the introduced elastic clamping stresses the component will reconfigure after clamping, this phenomenon is known as springback. the focus of this work is the design of a clamping system for flexible bodies in order to reduce the springback and to enable high precision processing. this clamping system consists in a set of supports, which adjust to the surface of the body without introducing stresses and causing no springback after the machining process. the number and the arrangement of the supports are optimized as a function of the intensity and position of the milling force and the geometrical and mechanical properties of the body as well. the functional unit of the clamping system is a cylindrical bodysliding nearly frictionless within a pipe. numerical simulation is used for configuration and optimization. the developed clamping systems can also be used to process freeform shaped bodies.
machine_design	to enable important scientific discoveries, eso has defined a new ground-based telescope: the european extremely large telescope (e-elt). the baseline design features a telescope with a 39-m-class primary mirror (m1), making it the largest and most powerful telescope in the world. the m1 consists of 798 hexagonal segments, each about 1.4 m wide, but only 50 mm thick. in the last stages of the manufacturing process of these m1 segments, a nanometre-accurate metrology method is required for the m1 to be within specifications. the segments have to be measured on their whiffle-tree support structures with a nanometre-level uncertainty, with a total budget on form accuracy of 50 nm rms for any segment assembly. in this paper a measurement machine design is presented based on a non-contact single-point scanning technique, capable of measuring with nanometre accuracy, being universal, fast and with low operational costs, providing suitable metrology for m1 segments. a tactile precision probe is implemented to be able to use the machine in earlier stages of the segment manufacturing process. in particular, this paper describes the design of the air-bearing motion system and the separate metrology system based on a moving sintered silicon carbide tube, a fixed zerodur metrology frame and an interferometric system for a direct and short metrology loop. preliminary calculations show nanometre-level measurement uncertainty after calibration.

machine_design	the design method of initial topology of interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (ipmsm) for hybrid electric vehicle (hev) propulsion is described in this paper. design constraints are selected on the basis of limitations imposed by machine 's manufacturer and application (e.g. maximum copper slot fill factor, air gap length, permanent magnet material, limited space available in drive trains, etc.). design variables are rotor radius, stator slot width and number of turns per phase winding. parametric analysis is performed for various machine topologies. the cost function, which connects the distribution of operating points of hev and the efficiency maps of various topologies of an electrical machine, is defined. obtained parametric results are compared to find the result leading to the extreme value of the cost function. the initial design of ipmsm that corresponds to this result is considered as the best initial design.
machine_design	this paper proposes and implements a new single-phase magnetless flux switching machine (fsm) for rooftop wind power generation. the key is to integrate an outer-rotor fsm and an inner-rotor fsm with shared stator yoke and stator drum windings. in such a way, this proposed machine can not only realize flux switching function to regulate magnetic flux effectively, but also incorporate the field and armature windings within one stator to reduce the copper losses and improve the overall machine efficiency. meanwhile, the structure is compact and rotors can be directly driven by blades to capture the wind power. the machine design guidelines from both magnetic and electric aspects are illustrated, the machine characteristics are analyzed by using time-stepping finite-element method, and the system performances are evaluated based on mathematical modeling. both simulation and prototyping test are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed machine and system.
machine_design	combining biological components, such as cells and tissues, with soft robotics can enable the fabrication of biological machines with the ability to sense, process signals, and produce force. an intuitive demonstration of a biological machine is one that can produce motion in response to controllable external signaling. whereas cardiac cell-driven biological actuators have been demonstrated, the requirements of these machines to respond to stimuli and exhibit controlled movement merit the use of skeletal muscle, the primary generator of actuation in animals, as a contractile power source. here, we report the development of 3d printed hydrogel ""bio-bots"" with an asymmetric physical design and powered by the actuation of an engineered mammalian skeletal muscle strip to result in net locomotion of the bio-bot. geometric design and material properties of the hydrogel bio-bots were optimized using stereolithographic 3d printing, and the effect of collagen i and fibrin extracellular matrix proteins and insulin-like growth factor 1 on the force production of engineered skeletal muscle was characterized. electrical stimulation triggered contraction of cells in the muscle strip and net locomotion of the bio-bot with a maximum velocity of similar to 156 m s(-1), which is over 1.5 body lengths per min. modeling and simulation were used to understand both the effect of different design parameters on the bio-bot and the mechanism of motion. this demonstration advances the goal of realizing forward-engineered integrated cellular machines and systems, which can have a myriad array of applications in drug screening, programmable tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biomimetic machine design.
machine_design	fretting fatigue is a phenomenon which occurs when two parts are contacted to each other and one of those parts or both are subjected to cyclic load. fretting decreases fatigue life of materials drastically by half or even more. therefore, investigation of fretting fatigue life of materials is an important subject. fretting fatigue tests are usually performed using universal hydraulic testing devices. in this work, a rotating bending apparatus for fretting fatigue test is introduced in which the cyclic load is provided by an adjustable eccentric load. the apparatus called rbff machine which is the abbreviation of rotating bending fretting fatigue. the eccentric load is measured by load cell. the coefficient of friction and fretting load are measured by foil strain gauges using a wheatstone bridge configuration. the performance of the machine is verified with doing a comparison between fatigue lives of a number of al7075-t6 alloy samples on a shimadzu rotating bending fatigue testing machine and rbff. the results shows very close assent between the operations of the two testing rigs. the main privileges of rbff are its simplicity with respect to universal devices, cheapness and, coefficient of friction (between pads and specimen) evaluation during the test. the rbff also has the capability of being used for any other soft and hard metals. it can be advanced further for high and low temperature.
thermodynamics	phytochelatins or pcn,(gamma glu-cys),-gly,and their glutathione (gsh) precursor are thiol-rich peptides that play an important role in heavy metal detoxification in plants and microorganisms. complex formation between cd2+ and pb2+ and gsh or pcn (n = 2, 4 and 6) are investigated by microcalorimetry, absorption spectrophotometry and t-jump kinetics. complex formation with pb2+ or cd2+ is exothermic, and induces ligand metal charge transfer bands in uv absorption spectral range, which implies the formation of a coordination bond between the metal and the thiol groups of the phytochelatins. absorption spectra and microcalorimetry experiments allow the determination of the affinity constants and the stoichiometry of the complexes. we show that the three pcn interact with pb2+ to form the 1:1 and 2:1 m:l complexes, with similar affinity constants (log k-11(pb) similar to 4.6 log k-21(pb)similar to 11.4). these affinities are independent of the number of thiols and are, moreover, lower than those determined for complex formation with cd2+. on the other hand, with cd2+, pc2-cd, pc2-cd-2, (pc2)(3)-cd-2, pc4-cd, pc4-cd-2, pc6-cd, (pc6)(2)-cd-3 and pc6-cd-3 complexes are detected. furthermore, for pc4-cd, the 1:1 complex is the most stable: affinity constant (log k-11(cd)similar to 7.5). kinetic studies indicate that complex formation between cd2+ and gsh occurs in the ms range; direct rate constant k(obs) = (6.8 +/- 0.3) 106 m-1 s(-1) and reverse rate constant k(-obs), = 340 +/- 210 s(-1). thus, when encapsulated in a silica matrix, pcn can be good candidates for heavy metal detection.

thermodynamics	the general class of bianchi cosmological models with dark energy in the form of modified chaplygin gas with variable lambda and g and bulk viscosity have been considered. we discuss three types of average scale factor by using a special law for deceleration parameter which is linear in time with negative slope. the exact solutions to the corresponding field equations are obtained. we obtain the solution of bulk viscosity (xi), cosmological constant (lambda), gravitational parameter (g) and deceleration parameter (q) for different equations of state. the model describes an accelerating universe for large value of time t, wherein the effective negative pressure induced by chaplygin gas and bulk viscous pressure are driving the acceleration.
thermodynamics	the specimen size has a significant influence on the flow behavior of zr55cu30al10ni5 bulk metallic glass throughout thermoplastic compression processes in the supercooled liquid region. due to enhanced structural relaxation, the recovery enthalpy increases with specimen size decreasing. based on combined differential scanning calorimetry experiments and finite element modeling simulations, the different free volume annihilations caused by the specific surface area discrepancy are considered as the main cause of size-dependent free volume variation during the pre-heating process. thermodynamics and structural relaxation theory are introduced to provide a reasonable explanation of the size-dependent flow behavior at elevated temperatures. a novel prediction model involving size-induced free volume variations has been established by considering the influences of compression deformation variables. the quantitative theoretical prediction agrees well with experimental data, which indicates that the developed prediction model can accurately describe the size-dependent free volume annihilation and generation during the thermoplastic forming process. furthermore, the reasonable theoretical analysis and size-dependent free volume prediction model provide a profound understanding of the size-dependent flow behavior and its relation to internal structural evolution behaviors of metallic glasses.

thermodynamics	in an effort to screen out the alginolytic and cellulolytic bacteria from the putrefying invasive seaweed sargassum species accumulated off barbados' coast, a potent bacterial strain was isolated. this bacterium, which simultaneously produced alginate lyase and cellulase, was identified as exiguobacterium sp. alg-s5 via the phylogenetic approach targeting the 16s rrna gene. the co-produced alginate lyase and cellulase exhibited maximal enzymatic activity at ph 7.5 and at 40 degrees c and 45 degrees c, respectively. the k-m and v-max values recorded as 0.91 mg/ml and 21.8 u/mg-protein, respectively, for alginate lyase, and 10.9 mg/ml and 74.6 u/mg-protein, respectively, for cellulase. first order kinetic analysis of the thermal denaturation of the co-produced alginate lyase and cellulase in the temperature range from 40 degrees c to 55 degrees c revealed that both the enzymes were thermodynamically efficient by displaying higher activation energy and enthalpy of denaturation. these enzymatic properties indicate the potential industrial importance of this bacterium in algal biomass conversion. this appears to be the first report on assessing the efficacy of a bacterium for the co-production of alginate lyase and cellulase.

thermodynamics	the halogen bond (xb) is a topical noncovalent interaction of rapidly increasing importance. the xb employs a 'soft' donor atom in comparison to the 'hard' proton of the hydrogen bond (hb). this difference has led to the hypothesis that xbs can form more favorable interactions with 'soft' bases than hbs. while computational studies have supported this suggestion, solution and solid-state data are lacking. here, xb soft-soft complementarity is investigated with a bidentate receptor that shows similar associations with neutral carbonyls and heavy chalcogen analogs. the solution speciation and xb soft-soft complementarity is supported by four crystal structures containing neutral and anionic soft lewis bases.

materials_engineering	artificial intelligence (ai) approach has been successfully applied to a wide range of materials engineering problems so far. however, there is no work on incorporation of modeling algorithms based on alto predict the performance of thermoelectric materials. this paper shows how to predict the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit of sr1-xyxtio3 ceramics as the performance symbol of these structures, using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (anfis). moreover, this work investigates the effect of the process parameters including y content, compact pressure, sintering temperature, sintering time and process temperature on the performance of sr1-xyxtio3 thermoelectric ceramics. absolute fraction of variance and root mean square error of 0.99 and 0.008, in training and testing phases of the model were achieved showing the relatively high accuracy of the proposed anfis model. to investigate the effect of the synthesis method (synthesis type) of sr1-xyxtio3 ceramics on the performance of these materials, this parameter was also introduced to the model and the obtained results were shown in 3d graphs. these 3d interaction graphs between some of process variables generated by the proposed model indicated that the combustion synthesis is more effective than other ones to increase the efficiency of the sr1-xyxtio3 thermoelectric ceramics.

strength_of_materials	a dislocation is a topological defect where the atoms are out of position in a crystalline structure. it plays an important role in the theory of plasticity for the stability and the strength of materials and in melting processes. in this paper, we report an experimental and numerical study of the interaction between such a dislocation and a compressional solitary wave in 2-d strongly coupled plasma crystals. complex plasmas consist of micrometer-sized spheres immersed into an ordinary ion-electron plasma. they can exist in solid, liquid, and gaseous states and are model systems to study dynamic phenomena.
strength_of_materials	objective: different biomaterials have been used as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. the purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of bovine bone collagen to the porosity, water retention, degradation rate and biomechanical characteristics of composite scaffolds. methods: bovine bone collagen solution was mixed with cellulose nanofibers solution, and then the mixture was added a certain quality of hydroxyapatite. we divided the mixture into two groups according to the different bovine bone collagen solution mass fraction: no. 1 (0 % bovine bone collagen), no. 2 (50 % bovine bone collagen). the surface structure and the pore size was observed under the scanning electron microscopic. then we calculated the porosity, degradation rate, water content and biomechanical properties. results: two groups of scaffold materials showed a multi-pore structure. the average pore size were 133.4 +/- 13.5 mu m and 221.7 +/- 16.8 mu m. the porosity was (91.65 +/- 1.75) % and (85.42 +/- 1.48) %. statistical analysis showed that two groups of material porosity difference were statistically significant (p<0.05). the degradation rates of two groups of scaffold materials at six weeks were (60.25 +/- 1.81) % and (23.16 +/- 1.027) %. statistical analysis showed that the degradation rate of the material differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p<0.05). water content of two groups of scaffold materials was (97.44 perpendicular to 0.98 % and (91.36 perpendicular to 0.77) %. statistical analysis showed that the water content of the material differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p<0.05). biomechanical properties of the second group increased significantly. conclusion: it could be seen from the experimental data that bovine bone collagen could increase the pore size, improved stability to degradation and the biomechanical strength of materials. therefore, the biocomposite studied has several characteristics considered as ideal for its use as a scaffold for osteoconduction and osteoinduction.
strength_of_materials	masonry walls subjected to in-plane loading exhibit a complex behavior because of the influence of several parameters such as axial load, aspect ratio, and the strength of materials. in high-rise buildings or seismic areas, large tensile stresses may arise in these walls, and vertical and horizontal reinforcement is often used to provide proper resistance, which increases the complexity of the structural behavior. this work presents (1) an overview of the experimental behavior of unreinforced and reinforced masonry walls; (2) an overview of distinct design methods aimed at calculating the in-plane lateral resistance; and (3) a proposal of a new design model for reinforced masonry walls subjected to in-plane loading. the proposed model considers the coupling interaction of the flexural and shear resisting mechanisms and updates the role of the vertical and horizontal reinforcement to the lateral resistance. a database composed of experimental results of the in-plane lateral resistance of 101 masonry walls available in the literature was used to evaluate the performance of existing models and to validate the newly proposed model, which exhibits much better performance. doi: 10.1061/(asce)st.1943-541x.0000636.

strength_of_materials	on the basis of ab initio simulations, the value of strength of interatomic bonds in one-, two- and three-dimensional carbon crystals is obtained. it is shown that decreasing in dimensionality of crystal gives rise to nearly linear increase in strength of atomic bonds. it is ascertained that growth of strength of the crystal with a decrease in its dimensionality is due to both a reduction in coordination number of atom and increase in the angle between the directions of atomic bonds. based on these data, it is substantiated that the one-dimensional (1d) crystals have maximum strength, and strength of carbyne is the absolute upper limit of strength of materials.
strength_of_materials	in recent years, there have been a lot of new developments concerning the use of advanced materials for lightweight structures. examples are long- and short-fibre-reinforced composites, sandwiches, foams, and, last but not least, nanostructures. the analysis of structures made of these materials can be performed on the basis of the mechanics of composites. however, stimulated by new applications, new manufacturing technologies, new material compositions, etc. a review of the mechanics of composites is necessary. in this article, some of the actual trends are discussed, for example developments in the application of long-and short-fibre-reinforced composites, laminates affected by multifield loadings, effective property-based analysis of foams, and the description of nanostructures within the concepts of continuum mechanics. the starting point of the review are the engineering mechanics basics on the level of the bsc program, that means the classical strength of materials. extensions of materials strength foundations (for example, inclusion of anisotropy) are often sufficient as first improved estimates. if it is necessary, elements of continuum mechanics, of material testing or numerical solution techniques can be implied. the every year increasing number of publications in the field of advanced materials for lightweight structures does not allow to give a complete overview over the state of the art. recognizing this fact, the author will give a report only of directions related to his own research group and/or in the surrounding of his team.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper presents a theoretical model and addresses several issues related to life cycle cost analysis to illustrate how time-inconsistent preferences affect consumer choice. the particular case study selects involved consumer choice between a vehicle with high initial acquisition cost but low ownership cost (e.g., an electric vehicle, ev) and one with a low initial acquisition cost but high ownership cost (e.g., a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, icev). to test our theoretical analysis, we conduct an empirical study on how time discounting rates affect consumer choice between icevs and evs with different initial cost ratios. from the survey results, we find that individuals with higher present bias showed irrational purchase behavior even when controlling for wealth level. specifically, people making some ""stronger bias to present' decisions chose higher total cost icevs with lower initial cost but higher ownership cost over lower total cost evs with higher initial cost and lower ownership cost. however, people 's long-term discount is not correlated with irrational vehicle purchase behavior. furthermore, we study the present bias and long-term discount rate in one scenario and found present bias to be correlated with irrational behavior.

internal_combustion_engine	this study aimed to compare the performance of an internal combustion engine fed with blends of biodiesel produced from soybean and diesel, and blends of biodiesel produced from beef tallow and diesel. performance was evaluated in terms of power generated at low loading conditions (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 kw) and emission of organic and inorganic pollutants. in order to analyse inorganic gases (co, so2 and nox), an automatic analyser was used and the organic emissions (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - btex) were carried out using a gas chromatograph. the results indicate that the introduction of the two biodiesels in the fuel caused a reduction in co, so2 and btex emissions. in addition, the reduction was proportional to the increase in loading regime. beef tallow biodiesels presented better results regarding emission than soybean biodiesels. the use of pure biodiesels also presented a net reduction in pollutant gas emissions without hindering the engine generator performance.
internal_combustion_engine	to reduce the fuel consumption of internal combustion engines, more attention has been paid to the tribological performance of the piston ring pack during the cold start and idle operations. in this research, a numerical model considering the cylinder liner deformation and the piston ring conformability is developed to predict the blow-by, lubrication, friction and wear of the piston ring pack under different operating conditions. the gas flow rate, inter-ring gas pressures, minimum oil film thickness, frictional force and wear load during cold start are calculated and compared with those during warm idle operating conditions. the results show that cylinder liner deformation and piston ring conformability together obviously affect blow-by and other tribological performance. meanwhile, it is found that friction loss is larger during cold start than during warm idle operating conditions. however, the wear process is more severe during warm idle operation than during cold start. from this research, the blow-by and tribological performance of the piston ring pack during cold start and warm idle operations are understood more deeply.
internal_combustion_engine	in this two-part paper, a topological analysis of powertrains for refuse-collecting vehicles (rcvs) based on simulation of different architectures (internal combustion engine, hybrid electric, and hybrid hydraulic) on real routes is proposed. in this second part, three different hybrid electric powertrain architectures are proposed and modeled. these architectures are based on the use of fuel cells, ultracapacitors, and batteries. a calculation engine, which is specifically designed to estimate energy consumption, respecting the original performance as the original internal combustion engine (ice), is presented and used for simulations and component sizing. finally, the overall performance of the different architectures (hybrid hydraulic, taken from the first paper part, and hybrid electric, estimated in this second part) and control strategies are summarized in a fuel and energy consumption table. based on this table, an analysis of the different architecture performance results is carried out. from this analysis, a technological evolution of these vehicles in the medium- and long terms is proposed.
internal_combustion_engine	the well-to-wheel (wtw) methodology is widely used for policy support in road transport. it can be seen as a simplified life cycle assessment (lca) that focuses on the energy consumption and co2 emissions only for the fuel being consumed, ignoring other stages of a vehicle 's life cycle. wtw results are therefore different from lca results. in order to close this gap, the authors propose a hybrid wtw+lca methodology useful to assess the greenhouse gas (ghg) profiles of road vehicles. the proposed method (hybrid wtw+lca) keeps the main hypotheses of the wtw methodology, but integrates them with lca data restricted to the global warming potential (gwp) occurring during the manufacturing of the battery pack. wtw data are used for the ghg intensity of the eu electric mix, after a consistency check with the main life cycle impact (lci) sources available in literature. a numerical example is provided, comparing ghg emissions due to the use of a battery electric vehicle (bev) with emissions from an internal combustion engine vehicle. this comparison is done both according to the wtw approach (namely the jec wtw version 4) and the proposed hybrid wtw+lca method. the ghg savings due to the use of bevs calculated with the wtw-4 range between 44 and 56 %, while according to the hybrid method the savings are lower (31-46 %). this difference is due to the gwp which arises as a result of the manufacturing of the battery pack for the electric vehicles. the wtw methodology used in policy support to quantify energy content and ghg emissions of fuels and powertrains can produce results closer to the lca methodology by adopting a hybrid wtw+lca approach. while evaluating ghg savings due to the use of bevs, it is important that this method considers the gwp due to the manufacturing of the battery pack.
