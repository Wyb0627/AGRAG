alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. one of the factors that promotes neurodegeneration is the accumulation of senile plaques formed by a beta peptide. in this paper, it was analyzed that if oxidative stress is cause or consequence of amyloid cascade and the role of antioxidant defense system in this process, using s. cerevisiae (with a multicopy plasmid containing the a beta 1-42 sequence) as experimental model. cells grown on glycerol were more tolerant than when grown on glucose, strengthening the role of the antioxidant defense system against a beta accumulation. antioxidant defense deficiency did not change the pattern of amyloid aggregation. on the other hand, the presence of a beta increased the level of intracellular oxidation and induced the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and aconitase. peroxissomal catalase deficient cells (delta cta1), were more sensitive to a beta toxicity than the wild type strain, while mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (sod2) deficient cells displayed the highest frequency of petites. besides, a beta alters the oxygen consumption and the activity of complex iii and iv. taken together, our results point out that the a beta toxicity mechanism involves an oxidative stress induction by increasing ros production into the mitochondria, where cta1 and sod2 play a crucial role in the regulation of the redox balance.

alzheimer's_disease	the brain 's neocortex is anatomically organized into grey and white matter, which are mainly composed by neuronal and glial cells, respectively. the neocortex can be further divided in different brodmann areas according to their cytoarchitectural organization, which are associated with distinct cortical functions. there is increasing evidence that brain development and function are governed by epigenetic processes, yet their contribution to the functional organization of the neocortex remains incompletely understood. herein, we determined the dna methylation patterns of grey and white matter of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (brodmann area 9), an important region for higher cognitive skills that is particularly affected in various neurological diseases. for avoiding interindividual differences, we analyzed white and grey matter from the same donor using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and for validating their biological significance, we used infinium humanmethylation450 beadchip and pyrosequencing in ten and twenty independent samples, respectively. the combination of these analysis indicated robust grey-white matter differences in dna methylation. what is more, cell type-specific markers were enriched among the most differentially methylated genes. interestingly, we also found an outstanding number of grey-white matter differentially methylated genes that have previously been associated with alzheimer 's, parkinson 's, and huntington 's disease, as well as multiple and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. the data presented here thus constitute an important resource for future studies not only to gain insight into brain regional as well as grey and white matter differences, but also to unmask epigenetic alterations that might underlie neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease is a representative age-related neurodegenerative disease that could result in loss of memory and cognitive deficiency. however, the precise onset time of alzheimer 's disease affecting neuronal circuits and the mechanisms underlying the changes are not clearly known. to address the neuroanatomical changes during the early pathologic developing process, we acquired the neuronal morphological characterization of ad in app/ps1 double-transgenic mice using the micro-optical sectioning tomography system. we reconstructed the neurons in 3d datasets with a resolution of 0.32 x 032 x 1 gm and used the sholl method to analyze the anatomical characterization of the dendritic branches. the results showed that, similar to the progressive change in amyloid plaques, the number of dendritic branches were significantly decreased in 9-month-old mice. in addition, a distinct reduction of dendritic complexity occurred in third and fourth-order dendritic branches of 9-month-old mice, while no significant changes were identified in these parameters in 6-month-old mice. at the branch-level, the density distribution of dendritic arbors in the radial direction decreased in the range of 40-90 gm from the neuron soma in 6-month-old mice. these changes in the dendritic complexity suggest that these reductions contribute to the progressive cognitive impairment seen in app/ps1 mice. this work may yield insights into the early changes in dendritic abnormality and its relevance to dysfunctional mechanisms of learning, memory and emotion in alzheimer 's disease.

alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease is a multifactorial and fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by decline of cholinergic function, deregulation of other neurotransmitter systems, beta-amyloid fibril deposition, and beta-amyloid oligomers formation. based on the involvement of a relevant number of biological systems in alzheimer 's disease progression, multitarget compounds may enable therapeutic efficacy. accordingly, compounds possessing, besides anticholinergic activity and beta-amyloid aggregation inhibition properties, metal chelating and/or nitric oxide releasing properties with additional antioxidant capacity were developed. other targets relevant to alzheimer 's disease have also been considered in the last years for producing multitarget compounds such as beta-secretase, monoamino oxidases, serotonin receptors and sigma 1 receptors. the purpose of this review will be to highlight recent reports on the development of multitarget compounds for alzheimer 's disease published within the last years focusing on multifunctional ligands characterized by tacrine-like and donepezil-like structures.

parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is an insidious onset neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 1% of the population over the age of 65. so far available therapies for pd have only aimed at improving or alleviating symptoms, but not at slowing, preventing, and reversing the course of pd. recently, some studies have indicated that the levels and activation of abelson non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-abl, abl1) were up-regulated in the brain tissue of patients with pd and demonstrated that c-abl inhibitors could improve motor behavior, prevent the loss of dopamine neurons, inhibit phosphorylation of cdk5, regulate alpha-synuclein phosphorylation and clearance, inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of parkin and decrease parkin substrate, for example, paris (zinc finger protein 746), aimp2 (aminoacyl-trna synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein type2), fbp1 (fuse-binding protein 1), and synphilin-1. therefore, we review the mechanism of the c-abl inhibitor in pd and conclude that c-abl inhibitors may be a potential treatment in pd and other neurodegenerative disease.
parkinson's_disease	neural synchrony in the basal ganglia, especially in the beta frequency band (13-30 hz), is a hallmark of parkinson 's disease and considered as antikinetic. in contrast, the healthy basal ganglia show low levels of synchrony. it is currently unknown where synchrony and oscillations arise in the parkinsonian brain and how they are transmitted through the basal ganglia, as well as what makes them dependent on dopamine. the external part of the globus pallidus has recently been identified as a hub nucleus in the basal ganglia, possessing intrinsic inhibitory connections and possibly also gap junctions. in this study, we show that in a conductance-based network model of the basal ganglia, the combination of sparse, high-conductance inhibitory synapses and sparse, low-conductance gap junctions in the external part of the globus pallidus could effectively desynchronize the whole network. however, when gap junction coupling became strong enough, the effect was impeded and activity synchronized. in particular, sustained periods of beta coherence occurred between some neuron pairs. as gap junctions can change their conductance with the dopamine level, we suggest pallidal gap junction coupling as a mechanism contributing to the development of beta synchrony in the parkinsonian basal ganglia.
parkinson's_disease	background: the proteasome catalyzes the degradation of many mis-folded proteins, which are otherwise cytotoxic. there is interest in the discovery of proteasome agonists, but previous efforts to do so have been disappointing. methods: the cleavage of small fluorogenic peptides is used routinely as an assay to screen for proteasome modulators. we have developed follow-on assays that employ more physiologically relevant substrates. results: to demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow, the nih clinical collection (ncc) was screened. while many compounds stimulated proteasome-mediated proteolysis of the pro-fluorogenic peptide substrates, most failed to evince activity in assays with larger peptide or protein substrates. we also show that two molecules claimed previously to be proteasome agonists, oleuropein and betulinic acid, indeed accelerate hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate, but have no effect on the turnover of a mis-folded protein in vitro or in cellulo. however, two small molecules from the ncc, mk-866 and am-404, stimulate the proteasome-mediated turnover of a mis-folded protein in living cells by 3- to 4-fold. conclusion: assays that monitor the proteasome-mediated degradation of larger peptides and proteinscan distinguish bona fide agonists from compounds only able to stimulate the cleavage of short, non-physiologically relevant peptides. general significance: a suite of assays has been established that allows the discovery of bona fide proteasome agonists. am-404 and mk-866 can be useful tools for cell culture experiments, and can serve as scaffolds to generate more potent 20s stimulators.

parkinson's_disease	background: parkinson 's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in the widespread loss of select classes of neurons throughout the nervous system. the pathological hallmarks of parkinson 's disease are lewy bodies and neurites, of which alpha-synuclein fibrils are the major component. alpha-synuclein aggregation has been reported in the gut of parkinson 's disease patients, even up to a decade before motor symptoms, and similar observations have been made in animal models of disease. however, unlike the central nervous system, the nature of alpha-synuclein species that form these aggregates and the classes of neurons affected in the gut are unclear. we have previously reported selective expression of alpha-synuclein in cholinergic neurons in the gut (j comp neurol. 2013; 521: 657), suggesting they may be particularly vulnerable to degeneration in parkinson 's disease. methods: in this study, we used immunohistochemistry to detect alpha-synuclein oligomers and fibrils via conformation-specific antibodies after rotenone treatment or prolonged exposure to high [k+] in ex vivo segments of guinea-pig ileum maintained in organotypic culture. key results: rotenone and prolonged raising of [ k+] caused accumulation of - alpha-synuclein fibrils in the axons of cholinergic enteric neurons. this took place in a time- and, in the case of rotenone, concentration-dependent manner. rotenone also caused selective necrosis, indicated by increased cellular autofluorescence, of cholinergic enteric neurons, labeled by chat-immunoreactivity, also in a concentration-dependent manner. conclusions & inferences: to our knowledge, this is the first report of rotenone causing selective loss of a neurochemical class in the enteric nervous system. cholinergic enteric neurons may be particularly susceptible to lewy pathology and degeneration in parkinson 's disease.
parkinson's_disease	prion-like propagation of abnormal intracytoplasmic proteins, which are the defining features of major neurodegenerative disorders, such as alzheimer 's disease (ad), parkinson 's disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), has been proposed. a growing body of evidence strongly suggests that abnormal tau, alpha-synuclein and tdp-43 have prion-like properties, convert the corresponding normal proteins into abnormal forms, and are transmitted from cell to cell, spreading throughout the brain. this idea is extremely important not only for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, but also for the development of molecular therapies. since the distributions and spreading of the abnormal proteins are closely associated with disease symptoms and progression, gain-of-toxic-function of these proteins may affect the neurons and glial cells either directly or indirectly, or both. it is essential to regulate the aggregation of abnormal intracellular proteins and their cell-to-cell transmission in order to stop, or at least slow, the progression of these diseases.

sprains_and_strains	,background: the objective was to describe the patterns and mechanisms of water tubing related injuries treated in u.s. emergency departments. methods: the national electronic injury surveillance system was used to examine cases of water tubing related injuries. sample weights were used to calculate national estimates of water tubing related injuries. analyses were conducted in 2010. results: from 1991-2009 an estimated 69,471 injuries were treated in us emergency departments for water tubing related injuries. the annual number of cases increased 250% over the 19-year study period (p<.001). sprains and strains accounted for the largest portion of injuries (27.2%). the head was the most frequently injured body part (27.5%). children and adolescents= 20 years, were more likely than individuals 19 years to sustain sprains and strains (or: 2.11; 95% ci = 1.64-2.71) and were most commonly injured by impact with the water (54.6%). conclusions: patterns of water tubing related injuries differ for children and adults. research is needed to determine how best to reduce these injuries.
sprains_and_strains	objective-to determine the type and number of injuries that occur during the training and practice of muay thai kick boxing and to compare the data obtained with those from previous studies of karate and taekwondo. methods-one to one interviews using a standard questionnaire on injuries incurred during training and practice of muay thai kick boxing were conducted at various gyms and competitions in the united kingdom and a muay thai gala in holland. results-a total of 152 people were questioned, 132 men and 20 women. there were 19 beginners, 82 amateurs, and 51 professionals. injuries to the lower extremities were the most common in all groups. head injuries were the second most common in professionals and amateurs. trunk injuries were the next most common in beginners. the difference in injury distribution among the three groups was significant (p less than or equal to0.01). soft tissue trauma was the most common type of injury in the three groups. fractures were the second most common in professionals, and in amateurs and beginners it was sprains and strains (p less than or equal to0.05). annual injury rates were: beginners, 13.5/1000 participants; amateurs, 2.43/1000 participants; professionals, 2.79/1000 participants. for beginners, 7% of injuries resulted in seven or more days off training; for amateurs and professionals, these values were 4% and 5.8% respectively. conclusions-the results are similar to those found for karate and taekwondo with regard to injury distribution, type, and rate. the percentage of injuries resulting in time off training is less.
sprains_and_strains	objective: to characterize the risk of injury associated with 10 popular high school sports by comparing the relative frequency of injury and selected injury rates among sports, as well as the participation conditions within each sport. design and setting: a cohort observational study of high school athletes using a surveillance protocol whereby certified athletic trainers recorded data during the 1995-1997 academic years. subjects: players listed on the school 's varsity team rosters for football, wrestling, baseball, field hockey, softball, girls' volleyball, boys' or girls' basketball, and boys' or girls' soccer. measurements: injuries and opportunities for injury (exposures) were recorded daily. the definition of reportable injury used in the study required that certified athletic trainers evaluate the injured players and subsequently restrict them from participation. results: football had the highest injury rate per 1000 athlete-exposures at 8.1, and volleyball had the lowest rate at 1.7. only boys' (59.3%) and girls' (57.0%) soccer showed a larger proportion of reported injuries for games than practices, while volleyball was the only sport to demonstrate a higher injury rate per 1000 athlete-exposures for practices than for games. more than 73% of the injuries restricted players for fewer than 8 days. the proportion of knee injuries was highest for girls' soccer (19.4%) and lowest for baseball (10.5%). among the studied sports, sprains and strains accounted for more than 50% of the injuries, except in field hockey (45.7%). of the injuries requiring surgery, 60.3% were to the knee. conclusions: an inherent risk of injury is associated with participation in high school sports based on the nature of the game and the activities of the players. therefore, injury prevention programs should be in place for both practices and games. preventing reinjury through daily injury management is a critical component of an injury prevention program. although sports injuries cannot be entirely eliminated, consistent and professional evaluation of yearly injury patterns can provide focus for the development and evaluation of injury prevention strategies.
sprains_and_strains	myer, gd, quatman, ce, khoury, j, wall, ej, and hewett, te. youth versus adult ""weightlifting"" injuries presenting to united states emergency rooms: accidental versus nonaccidental injury mechanisms. j strength cond res 23(7): 2054-2060, 2009-resistance training has previously been purported to be unsafe and ineffective in children. the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate resistance training-related injuries presenting to u. s. emergency rooms by age, type, and mechanism of injury. we hypothesized that older athletes would sustain greater percentages of joint sprains and muscle strains, whereas younger athletes would sustain a greater percentage of accidental injuries that would result in an increased percentage of fractures in youths. the u. s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc) national electronic injury surveillance system was queried from 2002 to 2005 using the cpsc code for ""weightlifting."" subjects between the ages of 8 and 30 were grouped by age categories 8 to 13 (elementary/middle school age), 14 to 18 (high school), 19 to 22 (college), and 23 to 30 (adult). injuries were classified as ""accidental'' if caused by dropped weight or improper equipment use. multiple logistic regression was used to compare accidental injuries between age groups. the sample consisted of 4,111 patients. accidental injuries decreased (p14 to 18 >19 to 22 years = 23 to 30 years. conversely, sprain/strain injuries increased in each successive age group (p < 0.05). evaluation of only the nonaccidental injuries (n = 2,565) showed that the oldest categories (19-22 and 23-30 yr) demonstrated a greater percentage of sprains and strains relative to younger age categories (p < 0.001). two thirds of the injuries sustained in the 8 to 13 group were to the hand and foot and were most often related to ""dropping"" and ""pinching"" in the injury descriptions, and there was an increased percentage of fractures in the 8 to 13 group relative to all other groups (p < 0.001). the study findings indicate that children have lower risk of resistance training-related joint sprains and muscle strains than adults. the majority of youth resistance training injuries are the result of accidents that are potentially preventable with increased supervision and stricter safety guidelines.
sprains_and_strains	incidence and types of injuries were investigated among 180 nigerian soccer players selected from 6 clubs by a stratified random technique on the basis of somatotypes. the purpose was to identify physique types that are most prone to common injuries in soccer, in the groups during an 8-week duration of intensive training. a total of 552 injuries: sprains and strains (45%), bruises and cuts (30%), dislocations (15%), fractures (5%) and concussion (5%) were recorded sustained by players who participated in the 8-week period of vigorous daily training. the study found that 45% of the meso-ectomorphs (n = 65) and 44% of the mesomorphs (n = 50) sustained injuries while 85% of the ectomorphs (n = 25) and 50% of the ectomesomorphs (n = 40) were injured. the study concluded that soccer players whose somatotypes range between meso-ectomorphic to the mesomorphic builds are less prone to injuries than their more fragile linear counterparts. it recommended that soccer players should be preselected on the basis of somatotypes and in most cases, mesomorphic and meso-ectomorphic types should be finally considered. it proposed that match referees should endeavour to enforce the soccer rules and escbew prejudice to prevent frustration-aggression reactions which are good causes of injuries to players.
cancer	although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) have dramatically improved clinical outcome in chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), cure rarely occurs. this may be due to bcr-abl-independent, aberrant signaling pathways, one of which leads to leukotriene (lt) formation. well-recognized as inflammatory mediators, lt can also affect oncogenic mechanisms of several tumors. we have previously discovered elevated lt-synthesis and up-regulated cysteinyl-lt-inducing enzyme in cml. here we report on dose-dependent inhibition of cml cell growth exerted by specific blockers of lt-signaling. thus, the cysteinyl-lt1-receptor-antagonist montelukast significantly reduced the growth of k562, kcl22, and ku812 cells, as well as primary cd34(+)blood cells from two cml patients. adding montelukast to the tki imatinib caused combined inhibition. no effect was seen on normal bone marrow cells. similarly, growth inhibition was also observed with the 5-lipoxygenase (lo)-inhibitor bwa4c, the 5-lo-activating-protein-(flap)-inhibitor licofelone and the ltb4(blt1)-receptor-antagonist ly293111. thus, blocking of aberrant lt-signaling may provide an additional, novel therapeutic possibility in cml.
cancer	muff homolog 1 (mth1), a nudix phosphohydrolase enzyme participates in the process of repairing of dna damage by hydrolyzing oxidized deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate in cancer cells, is regarded as a potential target for anticancer therapy. in order to seek for promising inhibitor of mth1, structured based pharmacophore and 3d-qsar pharmacophore hypotheses combine with the admet analysis and lipinski 's rule of five were used for screening the public molecules libraries (asinex, ibscreen and natural). then molecular docking studies were performed on screened hits via various docking programs (glide sp, gold and glide xp), five molecules with three scaffolds were picked out as potential inhibitors against mth1. eventually, 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation was implemented on the potential inhibitors. the rmsd (root mean square deviation) values were used to illustrate bind stability between potential molecules and mth1. therefore, the five hits may be considered as promising mth1 inhibitors by all above studies.

cancer	this study aimed to evaluate the isoflavone and total phenolic contents in kefir-fermented soymilk storage and after the in vitro digestive system simulation (dss). soymilk was fermented with kefir culture (0.02 uc/l) at 25 degrees c for 15 h and stored at 4 degrees c for 4 days. after the fermentation and storage, the isoflavone and total phenolic contents were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry, respectively. the cell viability of lactic acid bacteria and yeast was evaluated. fermentation promoted an increase of approximately 3 log cfu/g cycles of the microorganisms and the storage process did not alter the aglycone isoflavones and total phenolic contents. the content of aglycone isoflavones increased 2-fold, and the total phenolic content increased 9-fold. therefore, kefir-fermented soymilk is a good source of aglycone isoflavones and phenolics, since the content of these substances was increased significantly after the in vitro digestive system simulation of the product.

cancer	the core components of the hippo signaling pathway are a cascade of kinases that govern the phosphorylation of downstream transcriptional co-activators, namely, yes-associated protein (yap) and ww domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (wwtr1, also known as taz). the hippo signaling pathway is considered an important tumor-suppressor pathway, and its dysregulation has been noted in a variety of human cancers, in which yap/wwtr1 enable cancerous cells to overcome contact inhibition, and to grow and spread uncontrollably. interestingly, however, recent studies have told a somewhat different but perhaps more intriguing yap/wwtr1 story, as these studies found that yap/wwtr1 function as a central hub that integrates signals from multiple upstream signaling pathways, cell cell interactions and mechanical forces and then bind to and activate different downstream transcriptional factors to direct cell social behavior and cell-cell interactions. in this review, we present the latest findings on the role of yap/wwtr1 in skin physiology, pathology and tumorigenesis and discuss the statuses of newly developed therapeutic interventions that target yap/wwtr1 in human cancers, as well as their prospects for use as skin cancer treatments.

cancer	acoustophoresis, the ability to acoustically manipulate particles and cells inside a microfluidic channel, is a critical enabling technology for cell-sorting applications. however, one of the major impediments for routine use of acoustophoresis at clinical laboratory has been the reliance on the inherent physical properties of cells for separation. here, we present a microfluidic-based microbubble-activated acoustic cell sorting (baacs) method that rely on the specific binding of target cells to microbubbles conjugated with specific antibodies on their surface for continuous cell separation using ultrasonic standing wave. in acoustophoresis, cells being positive acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure nodes. on the contrary, air-filled polymer-shelled microbubbles being strong negative acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure antinodes and can be used to selectively migrate target cells. as a proof of principle, we demonstrate the separation of cancer cell line in a suspension with better than 75% efficiency. moreover, 100% of the microbubble-cell conjugates migrated to the anti-node. hence a better upstream affinity-capture has the potential to provide higher sorting efficiency. the baacs technique expands the acoustic cell manipulation possibilities and offers cell-sorting solutions suited for applications at point of care.
sports_injuries	objectives: to determine the immediate pain relief effect of low-level laser therapy on sports injuries in athletes and degree of pain relief by the therapy. design: double-blind, randomized, comparative clinical study. methods: participants were 32 college athletes with motion pain at a defined site. participants were randomized into two groups in which the tested or placebo laser therapy was administered to determine pain intensity from painful action before and after laser irradiation, using the modified numerical rating scale. the post-therapeutic modified numerical rating scale score was subtracted from the pre-therapeutic modified numerical rating scale score to determine pain intensity difference, and the rate of pain intensity difference to pre-therapeutic modified numerical rating scale was calculated as pain relief rate. results: low-level laser therapy was effective in 75% of the laser group, whereas it was not effective in the placebo group, indicating a significant difference in favor of the laser group (p < 0.001). pain relief rate was significantly higher in the laser group than in the placebo group (36.94% vs. 8.20%, respectively, p <0.001), with the difference in pain relief rate being 28.74%. conclusions: low-level laser therapy provided an immediate pain relief effect, reducing pain by 28.74%. it was effective for pain relief in 75% of participants.

sports_injuries	background: excessive stiffness of lower limb muscles is associated with sports injuries. therefore, the identification of a reliable measurement of the shear elastic modulus of various ankle plantar flexion muscles is required to evaluate lower leg sports injuries. this study investigated the reliable measurement of the shear elastic modulus of the ankle plantar flexion muscles at different ankle positions. methods: twenty-three healthy young men (25.3 +/- 3.6 years, 172.9 +/- 5.0 cm, 67.2 +/- 7.2 kg) participated in this study. the shear elastic moduli of the ankle plantar flexion muscles including the lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, soleus, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum longus and tibialis posterior were measured using ultrasonic shear wave elastography at 0, 10 and 20 degrees dorsiflexion. results: the reliability of the shear elastic modulus measurements for each ankle position was assessed. the results showed that the interday reliability of the measurements differed between ankle positions and that the reliability of the shear elastic modulus measurements at 20 degrees dorsiflexion was higher than that at 10 degrees or 0 degrees. conclusion: our results suggest that measurements at 20 degrees dorsiflexion may provide a more reliable measurement of the shear elastic modulus of ankle plantar flexion muscles.
sports_injuries	background: sports injuries are often described as overuse or traumatic. little is known about the frequency of overuse injuries and, in particular, if they vary between different types of sporting activities. purpose: to identify any differences between sports in relation to diagnoses of overuse injuries of the extremities ( oie) and anatomical areas most likely to be injured in adults and to compare these findings with those reported in youngsters, as identified in a previous review. methods: a search was made in may 2015 and again in april 2016 in pubmed, sportdiscus, psycinfo, and web of sciences. search terms were "" overuse injuries or cumulative trauma disorders or musculoskeletal injuries "" and "" extremity or limb "" and "" physical activity or sport or risk factor or exercises "". inclusion criteria were: 1) prospective, or cross-sectional study design; 2) at least 1/3 of the population should be >= 19 years; 3) articles must clearly state if reported cases were classified as traumatic or overuse injuries in relation to a particular sports type, 4) sample size >50, and 5) articles must not deal with specific occupational subpopulations nor with clinical populations. a blinded systematic review was conducted and results reported per anatomical site of injury and diagnosis for the different sports. results: in all, 10 of 1435 identified articles were included, studying soccer, beach-volleyball and triathlon. in general, the incidence estimates were low, never above 2.0/1000 h of practice, similar to results seen in children/adolescents. the incidence estimates and the diagnoses of oie were given only in 4 articles on soccer, making comparisons between sports impossible. as in children/adolescents, the lower limb is more often affected than the upper but contrary to young people the injured site in adults is more often the knee and above, and there were also differences in the diagnoses for the two age groups. conclusion: the literature does not permit to identify clearly the difference in the incidence of oie for different sports showing that more but well-designed surveillance studies are needed.
sports_injuries	objectives: the majority of football injuries are caused by trauma to the lower extremities. shinguards are considered an important measure in preventing lower leg impact abrasions, contusions and fractures. given these benefits, federation internationale de football association introduced the shinguard law in 1990, which made wearing shinguards during matches mandatory. this study evaluated the effect of the introduction of the shinguard law for amateur players in the netherlands in the 1999/2000-football season on the incidence of lower leg injuries. design: time trend analyses on injury data covering 25 years of continuous registration (1986-2010). methods: data were retrieved from a system that records, all emergency department treatments in a random, representative sample of dutch hospitals. all injuries sustained in football by patients aged 6-65 years were included, except for injuries of the achilles tendon and weber fractures. time trends were analysed with multiple regression analyses; a model was fitted consisting of multiple straight lines, each representing a 5-year period. results: patients were predominantly males (92%) and treated for fractures (48%) or abrasions/contusions (52%) to the lower leg. the incidence of lower leg football injuries decreased significantly following the introduction of the shinguard law (1996-2000: -20%; 2001-2005: -25%), whereas the incidence of all other football injuries did not. this effect was more prominent at weekends/match days. no gender differences were found. conclusions: the results significantly show a preventive effect of the shinguard law underlining the relevance of rule changes as a preventive measure and wearing shinguards during both matches and training sessions.

sports_injuries	in the pediatric shoulder, injury and pathology can disrupt the muscle force balance, resulting in severe functional losses. as little data exists pertaining to in vivo pediatric shoulder muscle function, musculoskeletal data are crucially needed to advance the treatment of pediatric shoulder pathology/injury. therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a pediatric database of in vivo volumes for the major shoulder muscles and correlate these volumes with maximum isometric flexion/extension, internal/external rotation, and abduction/adduction joint moments. a methodology was developed to derive 3d shoulder muscle volumes and to divide the deltoid into sub-units with unique torque producing capabilities, based on segmentation of three-dimensional magnetic resonance images. eleven typically developing children/adolescents (4f/7m, 12.0 +/- 3.2 years, 150.8 +/- 16.7 cm, 49.2 +/- 16.4 kg) participated. correlation and regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between volume and maximum, voluntary, isometric joint torques. the deltoid demonstrated the largest (30.4 +/- 1.2%) and the supraspinatus the smallest (4.8 +/- 0.5%) percent of the total summed volume of all six muscles evaluated. the anterior and posterior deltoid sections were 43.4 +/- 3.9% and 56.6 +/- 3.9% of the total deltoid volume. the percent volumes were highly consistent across subjects. individual muscle volumes demonstrated moderate-high correlations with torque values (0.70-0.94, p<0.001). this study presents a comprehensive database documenting normative pediatric shoulder muscle volume. using these data a clear relationship between shoulder volume and the torques they produce was established in all three rotational degrees-of-freedom. this study furthers the understanding of shoulder muscle function and serves as a foundation for evaluating shoulder injury/pathology in the pediatric/adolescent population.

senior_health	background. the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes) in nursing home residents (nhrs) is increasing, concurrently with obesity and other comorbid conditions. nhr would benefit greatly from antidiabetic medications that would improve glycemic control and give a lower risk of hypoglycemia but that do not contribute to weight gain in obese individuals. objective. to examine the prescription patterns to nhrs with diabetes, including the use of newer injectable therapies such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) receptor agonists. methods. treatment patterns of diabetes in nhr were analyzed using minimum data set records and prescription claims from the omnicare senior health outcomes data repository (may 2011-september 2012). results. the prevalence of diabetes in this population of 229,283 nhrs was 35.4%. among the 44,665 nhrs with diabetes and prescription claims data, the prevalence of obesity (40.3%) and multiple comorbidities (100%) was high. approximately 20% of the nhrs with diabetes were aged80%), followed by oral agents (54%). glp-1 receptor agonist use was low (0.5%) and associated with poor treatment persistence. conclusion. considerations other than glycemic control may drive prescribing decisions, contrary to recommendations from the american diabetes association, american medical directors association, and european association for the study of diabetes.
senior_health	methods the study is based on semi-structured qualitative interviews with policy-makers and senior health care managers in two russian regions, and a review of published and unpublished sources on health systems and hiv in russia. findings we identified a number of factors associated with the system 's failure to address the epidemic. we argue that these factors are not unique to hiv/aids. the features of the wider health system within which the hiv response was set up influenced the structure and capacities of the programme, particularly its regulatory and clinical orientation; the discrepancy between formal commitments and implementation; the focus on screening services; and problems with scaling up interventions targeting high-risk groups. discussion the system-programme interplay is as important in middle-income countries as in poorer settings. an advanced health care infrastructure cannot protect health systems from potential failures in the delivery of vertical programmes. the hiv response cannot be effective, efficient and responsive to the needs of the population if the broader health system does not adhere to the same principles. strengthening hiv responses in post-soviet societies will require improvements in their wider health systems, namely advocacy of prevention for high-risk populations, reallocation of resources from curative towards preventive services, building decision-making capacities at the local level, and developing better working environments for health care staff.
senior_health	the senior consultant and senior health adviser in all genitourinary medicine clinics in the uk were sent a questionnaire on hiv testing practice in seven clinical scenarios. for each scenario the recommended time interval between possible exposure and final hiv antibody test varied from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of over 5 years. the results show 2 broad patterns: when the contact was not someone known to be hiv positive the commonest recommended time interval was 3 months; for a known exposure to hiv the commonest recommendation was 6 months. only 16 out of the 151 clinics replying had a written policy setting out the interval to elapse between possible exposure to hiv and the final test for hiv antibodies. variation of practice within clinics is less where written policies exist. some staff in clinics are recommending inappropriately long intervals before the final hiv test.
senior_health	objective: to examine the extent to which local health department (lhd) assurance of select services known to promote and protect the health of older adults is associated with more favorable population health indicators among seniors. design: data from the california health interview survey (chis: 2003, 2005, and 2007) were linked with the 2005 wave of the national association of county and city health officials profile survey and the area resource file to assess the association of lhd assurance and senior health indicators. assurance was measured by an index of 5 services, either directly provided or contracted by lhds: cancer screening, injury prevention, comprehensive primary care, home health care, and chronic disease prevention. multilevel regression models estimated the association of lhd assurance of services and each of 6 older adult health indicators, controlling for individual, lhd, and county characteristics that included key social determinants of health, such as poverty. setting: fifty-seven california counties. participants: 33,154 older adults (age 65 and older). main outcome measures: colorectal cancer screening, mammography, healthy eating, physical activity, and multiple falls among older adults. results: local health departments provided or contracted a median of 2 of the 5 services. in adjusted analyses, lhd assurance of services was generally unassociated with the seniors' health behaviors, screening, and falls. greater lhd expenditures per capita were associated with significantly better mammography screening rates (adjusted odds ratio [aor] = 1.22, p < 0.01) compared to jurisdictions in the bottom one-third of per capita lhd spending. greater county-level poverty (a social determinant of health) was associated with greater junk food consumption (aor = 1.14, p < 0.01) and worse fruit and vegetable consumption (aor = 0.97, p < 0.01). highly impoverished counties were consistently in the bottom quartile of performance across all indicators. conclusions: the lhd 's assurance of select services known to promote and protect the health of older adults does not appear to translate into higher rates of colorectal cancer screening, mammography, healthy eating, physical activity, and fewer falls among seniors. county-level poverty is most strongly associated with older adult health, underscoring a key barrier to address in local senior health improvement efforts.
senior_health	most approaches to the detection of presymptomatic or prodromal alzheimer 's disease require the costly collection and analysis of biological samples or neuroimaging measurements. the dementia risk assessment (dra) was developed to facilitate this detection by collecting self-report and proxy-report of dementia risk variables and episodic memory performance on a free internet website. we now report two validation studies. in study 1, 130 community-residing older adults seeking memory screening at senior health fairs were tested using the mini-cog, and were then observed while taking the dra. they were compared to a demographically-matched subsample from our anonymous internet sample. participants seeking memory screening had more dementia risk factors and obtained lower scores on the dra 's recognition memory test (rmt) than their internet controls. in addition, those who failed the mini-cog obtained much lower scores on the rmt than those who passed the mini-cog. in study 2, 160 older adults seeking evaluation of cognitive difficulties took the dra prior to diagnostic evaluations at outpatient dementia clinics. patients who ultimately received the diagnosis of a dementia syndrome scored significantly lower on the rmt than those diagnosed with other conditions or deemed normal. lower education, family history of dementia, presence of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, and memory test score distinguished the dementia and no-dementia groups with around 82% accuracy. in addition, score on the rmt correlated highly with scores on other instruments widely used to detect cognitive decline. these findings support the concurrent validity of the dra for detecting prevalent cognitive impairment. prospective studies of cognitively normal persons who subsequently develop dementia will be necessary to establish its predictive validity.
multiple_sclerosis	objective direct stimulation of the peroneal nerve by the actigait implantable drop foot stimulator is a potent therapy that was described previously for stroke-related drop foot. the authors report here successful long-term application of the actigait implantable drop foot stimulator in patients with multiple sclerosis (ms). methods six patients with ms and 2 years of persisting central leg paresis received an implantable actigait drop foot stimulator after successful surface test stimulation. ten weeks and 1 year after surgery, their gait speed, endurance, and safety were evaluated. patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. results in the 20-m gait test, stimulation with the actigait stimulator significantly reduced the time needed, on average, by approximately 23.6% 10 weeks after surgery, and the time improved further by 36.3% after 1 year. the median distance covered by patients with the stimulator after 6 minutes of walking increased significantly from 217 m to 321 m and remained stable for 1 year; the distance covered by patients after surface stimulation was 264 m. patients with an implanted actigait stimulator noticed pronounced improvement in their mobility, social participation, and quality of life. conclusions the actigait implantable drop foot stimulator improved gait speed, endurance, and quality of life in all patients over a period of 1 year. it may serve as a new therapeutic option for patients with ms-related drop foot.
multiple_sclerosis	backgrounda 30-item qualiveen questionnaire was developed to measure the impact of urinary problems on everyday living in spinal cord injury, and subsequently an 8-item sf-qualiveen was developed for those with multiple sclerosis (ms). the validity of this short form has not been previously examined using modern psychometric techniques, such as the rasch measurement model. objectivethe aim of this study is to test if the short form meets the requirements of the rasch model. methodsa total of 401 patients with clinically definite ms were given the questionnaire at three neuroscience centres in the uk. resultsa total of 258 patients (64.3% response) completed the questionnaire. the original scale failed to meet the expectations of the rasch model. a two-testlet solution was sought to account for local dependence, differential item functioning and disordered thresholds. after the modifications were made the scale fitted the model ((2)=5.93 p=0.4305), had high internal consistency (=0.88) and was unidimensional. conclusionssf-qualiveen is a simple and valid measure of the impact of urinary problems in multiple sclerosis, which meets the requirements of the rasch measurement model. summed ordinal scores can be converted to interval-level using the transformation table provided.
multiple_sclerosis	despite continuous interest in multiple sclerosis (ms) research, there is still a lack of neuroprotective strategies, because the main focus has remained on modulating the immune response. here we performed in-depth analysis of neurodegeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) and in in vitro studies regarding the effect of the well-established l-type calcium channel antagonist nimodipine. nimodipine treatment attenuated clinical eae and spinal cord degeneration and promoted remyelination. surprisingly, we observed calcium channel-independent effects on microglia, resulting in apoptosis. these effects were cell-type specific and irrespective of microglia polarization. apoptosis was accompanied by decreased levels of nitric oxide (no) and inducible no synthase (inos) in cell culture as well as decreased inos and reactive oxygen species levels in eae. in addition, increased numbers of olig2(+) apc(+) oligodendrocytes were detected. overall, nimodipine application seems to generate a favorable environment for regenerative processes and therefore could be a treatment option for ms, because it combines features of immunomodulation with beneficial effects on neuroregeneration.
multiple_sclerosis	background & purposeto describe methodology, interim baseline, and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (mri) acquisition parameter characteristics of the multiple sclerosis clinical outcome and mri in the united states (ms-mrius). material & methodsthe ms-mrius is an ongoing longitudinal and retrospective study of ms patients on fingolimod. clinical and brain mri image scan data were collected from 600 patients across 33 ms centers in the united states. mri brain outcomes included change in whole-brain volume, lateral ventricle volume, t2- and t1-lesion volumes, and new/enlarging t2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions. resultsinterim baseline and longitudinal mri acquisition parameters results are presented for 252 patients. mean age was 44 years and 81% were female. forty percent of scans had 3-dimensional (3d) t1 sequence in the preindex period, increasingto 50% in the postindex period. use of 2-dimensional (2d) t1 sequence decreased over time from 85% in the preindex period to 65% in the postindex. about 95% of the scans with flair and 2d t1-wi were considered acceptable or good quality compared to 99-100% with 3d t1-wi. there were notable changes in mri hardware, software, and coil (39.5% in preindex to index and 50% in index to postindex). mri sequence parameters (orientation, thickness, or protocol) differed for 36%, 29%, and 20% of index/postindex scans for flair, 2d t1-wi, and 3d t1-wi, respectively. conclusionsthe ms-mrius study linked the clinical and brain mri outcomes into an integrated database to create a cohort of fingolimod patients in real-world practice. variability was observed in mri acquisition protocols overtime.
multiple_sclerosis	aims: to better understand the impact of the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (ms) and disability on employment, absenteeism, and related factors. materials and methods: this study included respondents to the north american research committee on multiple sclerosis registry spring 2015 update survey who were us or canadian residents, aged 18-65 years and reported having relapsing-remitting ms (rrms), secondary progressive ms (spms), or primary progressive ms (ppms). the rrms and spms participants were combined to form the relapsing-onset ms (rms) group and compared with the ppms group regarding employment status, absenteeism, and disability. multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between employment-related outcomes and factors that may affect these relationships. results: of the 8004 survey respondents, 5887 (73.6%) were 18-65 years of age. the ppms group (n=344) had a higher proportion of males and older mean age at the time of the survey and at time of diagnosis than the rms group (n=4829). female sex, age, age at diagnosis, cognitive and hand function impairment, fatigue, higher disability levels, >= 3 comorbidities, and a diagnosis of ppms were associated with not working. after adjustment for disability, the employed ppms sub-group reported similar levels of absenteeism to the employed rms sub-group. limitations: limitations of the study include self-report of information and the possibility that participants may not fully represent the working-age ms population. conclusions: in ms, employment status and absenteeism are negatively affected by disability, cognitive impairment, and fatigue. these findings underscore the need for therapies that prevent disability progression and other symptoms that negatively affect productivity in persons with ms to enable them to persist in the workforce.
hepatitis_c	background: hepatitis c is an infectious liver disease with high mortality rate which is caused by hepatitis c virus. several treatment methods have been applied to combat this deadly virus including interferons, vaccine and direct acting antivirals (daas). however, the later shows promising effects in hcv treatment with lower adverse effect. specifically, the daas target the non-structural proteins (ns3 and ns5b). purpose: the objective of the present study is to hypothesize an alternative antiviral inhibitor for hcv from the available other antivirals. methods: computation of 2d molecular descriptors for the selected antiviral inhibitors followed by clustering the descriptor features. the closely clustered compounds were subjected to the interaction studies against the hcv target protein to validate the cluster result. results and discussion: the clustering result showed that indinavir (hiv inhibitor) and at130 (hbv inhibitor) molecule are close to the hcv inhibitor. the indinavir complexed with ns3 protein shows -5.33 kcal/mol and at-130 complexed with ns5b protein possess the binding energy of -8.87 kcal/mol. the docking interaction study indicated a better binding affinity than other viral inhibitors. conclusion: from the descriptor based feature similarity analysis and the interaction study, it can be concluded that indinavir and at-130 could be a potential alternative agent for hcv treatment.

hepatitis_c	background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections have increased during the past decade but little is known about geographic clustering patterns. methods: we used a unique analytical approach, combining geographic information systems (gis), spatial epidemiology, and statistical modeling to identify and characterize hcv hotspots, statistically significant clusters of census tracts with elevated hcv counts and rates. we compiled sociodemographic and hcv surveillance data (n = 99,780 cases) for massachusetts census tracts (n = 1464) from 2002 to 2013. we used a five-step spatial epidemiological approach, calculating incremental spatial autocorrelations and getis-ord gi* statistics to identify clusters. we conducted logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with the hcv hotspots. results: we identified nine hcv clusters, with the largest in boston, new bedford/fall river, worcester, and springfield (p < 0.05). in multivariable analyses, we found that hcv hotspots were independently and positively associated with the percent of the population that was hispanic (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 1.07; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.04, 1.09) and the percent of households receiving food stamps (aor: 1.83; 95% ci: 1.22, 2.74). hcv hotspots were independently and negatively associated with the percent of the population that were high school graduates or higher (aor: 0.91; 95% ci: 0.89, 0.93) and the percent of the population in the ""other"" race/ethnicity category (aor: 0.88; 95% ci: 0.85, 0.91). conclusion: we identified locations where hcv clusters were a concern, and where enhanced hcv prevention, treatment, and care can help combat the hcv epidemic in massachusetts. gis, spatial epidemiological and statistical analyses provided a rigorous approach to identify hotspot clusters of disease, which can inform public health policy and intervention targeting. further studies that incorporate spatiotemporal cluster analyses, bayesian spatial and geostatistical models, spatially weighted regression analyses, and assessment of associations between hcv clustering and the built environment are needed to expand upon our combined spatial epidemiological and statistical methods.
hepatitis_c	we previously generated an oral hepatitis c virus (hcv) vaccine using bifidobacterium displaying the hcv nonstructural protein 3 (ns3) polypeptide. ns3-specific cellular immunity is important for viral clearance and recovery from hcv infection. in this study, we enhanced the cellular immune responses induced by our oral hcv vaccine, bifidobacterium longum 2165 (b. longum 2165), by combining interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) as an adjuvant with the vaccine in a mouse experimental model. ifn-alpha is a widely used cytokine meeting the standard of care (soc) for hcv infection and plays various immunoregulatory roles. we treated c57bl/6n mice with b. longum 2165 every other day and/or ifn-alpha twice a week for a month and then analyzed the immune responses using spleen cells. we determined the induction of ns3-specific cellular immunity by cytokine quantification, intracellular cytokine staining, and a cytotoxic t lymphocyte (ctl) assay targeting el4 tumor cells expressing ns3/4a protein (el4-ns3/4a). we also treated mice bearing el4-ns3/4a tumor with the combination therapy in vivo. the results confirmed that the combination therapy of b. longum 2165 and ifn-a induced significantly higher ifn-gamma secretion, higher population of cd4(+)t and cd8(+)t cells secreting ifn-gamma, and higher ctl activity against el4-ns3/4a cells compared with the control groups of phosphate-buffered saline, b. longum 2165 alone, and ifn-alpha alone (p < 0.05). we also confirmed that the combination therapy strongly enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effects in vivo with no serious adverse effects (p < 0.05). these results suggest that the combination of b. longum 2165 and ifn-alpha could induce a strong cellular immunity specific to ns3 protein as a combination therapy augmenting the current soc immunotherapy against chronic hcv infection.
hepatitis_c	aim/objectives/backgroundchronic hepatitis c (chc) virus infection is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. in germany, as in many other countries, there is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological data. routine data from sickness funds can support the estimation of the true prevalence and incidence of chc.methodsin this article, the results of annual and quarterly analyses of prevalence and incidence for the years 2007-2013 are presented using data of several german sickness funds.resultsoverall, the prevalence rate remained relatively stable at 0.2%, which is lower than the general assumption for germany of 0.3%.conclusionwe found that despite the introduction of the breakthrough designated triple therapies with telaprevir or boceprevir in 2011, there was no increase of prevalence or incidence between 2010 and 2011. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
hepatitis_c	introduction: with thewidespread introduction of the integrase (in) inhibitors into clinical practice, transmission of drug resistance to this class of antiretroviralmedications may expand. the aimof this studywas to analyze the recent patterns of in resistance in treatment naive individuals in northern poland and its association with transmitted protease (pr) and reverse transcriptase (rt) mutations. methods: study included 172 pr, rt and ini sequences from antiretroviral treatment naive hiv-1 infected patients linked to care in northern poland from 2010 to 2015. drug resistance was interpreted based on the who surveillance and ias-usa mutation lists. for phylogeny maximum likelihood and bayesian monte carlo markov chain analyses were used. results: overall rate of transmitted drug resistancewas 12.21%. nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nrti) resistance associated substitutionswere found in 11.05% of cases and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance variants in 1.16%. in multivariate models transmitted resistance strongly associated with subtype d infections [66.67% compared to the 3.84% for subtype b (p = 0.001)]. no transmission of major protease or integrasemutationswere observed. polymorphisms associatedwith resistance against integrase inhibitor, mostly e157q, were found in 21.5% sequences and associated with female (31.91% vs. 15.2% for male, p = 0.01), injection drug use (84.21% compared to 22.08% for heterosexual and 1.39% for men-who-have-sex-with-men transmissions, p<0.0001) as well as hepatitis c coinfection [63.64% for positive, versus 8.57% for hcv antibody negative, p<0.0001]. clusters of nucleoside reverse transcriptase mutations in subtype d and integrase e157q variants in subtype b were observed. conclusions: transmitted drug resistance frequency was high in subtype d but limited to clustered nrti mutations, being infrequent among subtype b infected cases. despite lack of major integrase resistance in treatment naive patients, variants potentially affecting susceptibility to this classwere common, which indicates the potential need for extended surveillance in the near future.

weight_loss	the transport of nano-scale particles has become increasingly important, but the knowledge base available is limited. this study aims to bridge the knowledge gap between the nano-and micro-scales for pneumatic conveying. a key parameter is the minimum pickup velocity (u-pu), which is the minimum fluid velocity required to initiate motion in a particle originally at rest. the u-pu values of nine alumina particles with particle diameters (d(p)) ranging from 5 to 110,000 nm were determined using the weight loss method, then compared against the established pickup zones (analogous to the geldart groups). results indicated that: (1) u-pu varied non-monotonically with increasing d(p), thus revealing the missing link between the nano- and micro-scales; (2) the intermediate particle diameters surprisingly did not agree with any pickup zone; (3) zone iii (analogous to geldart group c) is inadequate for all the nano-scale particles, so new boundaries and a new zone are proposed.

weight_loss	background: neonates are expected to have weight loss in the first few days of life. many factors are considered to affect newborn weight loss such as breastfeeding adequacy, maternal parity, intravenous fluids administered during labor, and environmental factors. most of the studies have yielded variable results. the primary objective of this study was to assess the pattern of newborn weight loss in initial 72 h after birth and the factors affecting it. the secondary objective was to assess the impact of initial weight loss on neonatal jaundice beyond 72 h and regaining birth weight at the 10(th) day of life. materials and methods: a study was carried out on 250 term exclusively breastfed newborn babies. neonates were weighed initially at birth and then regularly at 12 hourly intervals for 72 h. data pertaining to various maternal factors affecting neonatal weight loss, birth weight of newborns, and adequacy of breastfeeding were recorded. the weight of the neonates on the 10(th) day was also recorded. results: about 79.2% of babies lost 5%u10% of birth weight and 12.8% of babies lost more than 10%. the maximum weight loss occurred between 60 and 72 h of life. the mean (standard deviation [sd]) percentage of weight loss in babies with inadequate breastfeeding was 9.01 (2.58) compared to 7.31 (1.82) in the adequately breastfed babies (p < 0.001). the mean (sd) percentage of weight loss in babies born to primipara was 8.31 (1.77) and in multipara it was 7.51 (2.43) (p = 0.005). neonates who developed significant jaundice had a mean (sd) percentage weight loss of 9.87 (3.40) compared to the rest in whom it was 7.59 (1.92) (p < 0.001). in the subgroup of babies who lost 10% of birth weight at 72 h, 88.2% did not regain birth weight on day 10 of life as compared to 55% of babies in the subgroup with weight loss <10% (p < 0.003). conclusion: regular monitoring of weight in exclusively breastfed babies is potentially useful. particular attention may need to be given to primipara mothers and babies who lose more than 10% weight by 72 h.
weight_loss	background: general health promoting campaigns are often not targeted at the people who need them the most. web- and app-based tools are a new way to reach, motivate, and help people with poor health status. objective: the aim of our study was to test a web- and mobile app-based tool(""sosu-life"") on employees in the social welfare and health care sector in denmark. methods: a randomized controlled trial was carried out as a workplace intervention. the tool was designed to help users make healthy lifestyle changes such as losing weight, exercise more, and quit smoking. a team competition between the participating workplaces took place during the first 16 weeks of the intervention. twenty nursing homes for elderly people in 6 municipalities in denmark participated in the study. the employees at the nursing homes were randomized either 1: 1 or 2: 1 on a municipality level to use the sosu-life tool or to serve as a control group with no intervention. all participants underwent baseline measurements including body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol level and they filled in a questionnaire covering various aspects of health. the participants were measured again after 16 and 38 weeks. results: a total of 566 (sosu-life: n = 355, control: n = 211) participants were included in the study. at 16 weeks there were 369 participants still in the study (sosu-life: n = 227, control: n = 142) and 269 participants completed the 38 week intervention (sosu-life: n = 152, control: n = 117). at 38 weeks, the sosu-life group had a larger decrease in body weight (-1.01 kg, p =. 03), body fat percentage (-0.8%, p =. 03), and waist circumference (-1.8 cm, p =. 007) compared with the control group. conclusions: the sosu-life web- and app-based tool had a modest yet beneficial effect on body weight and body fat percentage in the health care sector staff.
weight_loss	corrosion tests were conducted under static conditions at 450 and 550 a degrees c for various oxygen contents and durations with single crystal and sintered alumina regarded as model materials for ceramics. extremely pure and dense sintered alumina exhibited no intergranular corrosion and identical behavior as single crystal. corrosion appeared to proceed by reaction of al2o3 with dissolved oxygen (na2o) to form sodium aluminate (naalo2). then, sodium aluminate was dissolved in liquid sodium by a mechanism that is still to be elucidated. the corrosion morphology was equivalent to dissolution. from weight loss measurement, linear kinetics were found with a constant dissolution rate of (61 +/- 2)10(-4) mg dm(-2) h(-1) at 550 a degrees c and low oxygen content (< 1 ppm). no significant corrosion rate could be measured at 450 a degrees c and low oxygen content. an order reaction kinetics with respect to dissolved oxygen content of 0.6 +/- 0.2 was found.
weight_loss	we aim to review the available literature on obese patients treated with bariatric procedures, in order to assess their effect on the metabolic and gut microbiota profiles. a systematic literature search was performed in pubmed, cochrane library, and scopus databases, in accordance with the prisma guidelines. twenty-two studies (562 patients) met the inclusion criteria. this study points to significant amelioration of postoperative levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, ldl, hdl, homa-ir, food intake, and diabetes remission. branched-chain amino acids (bcaas) decreased, while trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao); glucagon-like peptide 1, 2 (glp-1, glp-2); and peptide yy (pyy) increased postoperatively. postoperative gut microbiota was similar to that of lean and less obese objects. well-designed randomized trials are necessary to further assess the host metabolic-microbial cross-talk after bariatric procedures.
low_testosterone	objective: obesity-associated hypogonadism is hypothesized to be due to the suppressive effect of high estradiol (from an increase in aromatase activity present in the abundant adipose tissue) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal unit resulting in low testosterone production. although weight loss has been found to be effective in reducing estradiol and raising testosterone levels in studies of younger men, its effect in frail, obese older men is understudied. thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of lifestyle intervention on hormone levels in frail, obese older men. design: randomized controlled trial of lifestyle intervention in frail, obese older men (>= 65 yo) for 1 year. setting: university hospital. methods: forty frail, obese elderly men were randomized, for a 52-week study, to any of the following treatment groups: (1) control group, (2) diet-induced weight loss group (diet group), (3) exercise training group (exercise group), and (4) diet-induced weight loss and exercise training group (diet-exercise group). the objective was to achieve a similar to 10 % weight loss at 6 months and maintain this weight for an additional 6 months. physical function was assessed by the modified physical performance testing (modified ppt). estradiol was measured by radioimmunoassay, testosterone by automated immunoassay, and sex hormone-binding globulin by enzyme-linked immunoassay. results: after 12 months of intervention, diet alone resulted in a weight loss of -10.1 +/- 1.9 kg in the diet group and -9.1 +/- 0.9 kg in the diet-exercise group. this resulted in a significant decrease (both p<0.05) in total estradiol compared to baseline among subjects in the diet (-2.5 +/- 1.3 pg/ml) and diet-exercise group (-2.2 +/- 4.0 pg/ml). free estradiol index also significantly decreased (both p<0.05) in both the diet (-0.39 +/- 0.14 pmol/nmol) and diet-exercise (-0.52 +/- 0.12 pmol/nmol) group. total testosterone significantly increased (p<0.05) in response to diet (71.0 +/- 21.0 ng/dl) and diet-exercise (49.9 +/- 15.5 pg/ml) resulting in values of 287.0 +/- 28.1 ng/dl in the diet and 317.6 +/- 33.1 ng/dl in the diet-exercise group. however, because there was a significant increase in sex hormonebinding globulin levels in both the diet and diet-exercise groups, free testosterone index and the changes in free testosterone index were not significant compared to baseline. regardless of changes in hormonal levels, patients in the diet, exercise, and diet-exercise groups experienced significant improvements in the modified ppt from baseline. conclusion: weight loss from lifestyle intervention resulted in significant decreases in total and free estradiol levels in frail, obese older men, but this did not result in a clinically important increase in total testosterone nor a significant increase in free testosterone. thus, alternative forms of treatment in addition to lifestyle intervention may be necessary to improve the hormonal profile among these patients. nevertheless, whether further improvement in hormonal profile would result in better physical performance than what can be achieved by lifestyle alone in these subjects remains uncertain.
low_testosterone	background. we describe the recruitment of men for the testosterone (t) trials, which were designed to determine the efficacy of t treatment. methods. men were eligible if they were >= 65 years, had an average of two morning total t values300 ng/ml, and had symptoms and objective evidence of mobility limitation, sexual dysfunction, and/or low vitality. men had to be eligible for and enroll in at least one of these three main trials (physical function, sexual function, vitality). results. men were recruited primarily through mass mailings in 12 u.s. communities: 82% of men who contacted the sites did so in response to mailings. men who responded were screened by telephone to ascertain eligibility. of 51,085 telephone screens, 53.5% were eligible for further screening. of 23,889 initial screening visits (sv1), 2,781 (11.6%) men were eligible for the second screening visit (sv2), which 2,261 (81.3%) completed. at sv2, 931 (41.2%) men met the criteria for one or more trials, the t level criterion and had no other exclusions. of these, 790 (84.6%) were randomized; 99 (12.5%) in all three trials and 348 (44%) in two trials. their mean age was 72 years and mean body mass index (bmi) was 31.0 kg/m(2). mean (standard deviation) total t (ng/dl) was 212.0 (40.0). conclusion: despite the telephone screening to enrollment ratio of 65 to 1, we met the recruitment goals for each trial. recruitment of symptomatic older men with low testosterone levels is difficult but feasible.
low_testosterone	prediabetes represents an elevation of plasma glucose above the normal range but below that of clinical diabetes. prediabetes includes individuals with ifg, igt, ifg with igt and elevated hba1c levels. insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction are characteristic of this disorder. the diagnosis of prediabetesis is vital as both ifg and igt are indeed well-known risk factors for type 2 diabetes with a greater risk in the presence of combined ifg and igt. furthermore, as will be illustrated in this review, prediabetes is associated with associated disorders typically only considered in with established diabetes. these include cardiovascular disease, periodontal disease, cognitive dysfunction, microvascular disease, blood pressure abnormalities, obstructive sleep apnea, low testosterone, metabolic syndrome, various biomarkers, fatty liver disease, and cancer. as the vast majority of individuals with prediabetes are unaware of their diagnosis, it is therefore vital that the associated conditions are identified, particularly in the presence of mild hyperglycemia, so they may benefit from early intervention.
low_testosterone	we report two newborns with female external genitalia and bilateral inguinal swelling who were diagnosed with 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency, a rare cause of 46,xy disorder of sexual development. the first case had normal clitoral size and vaginal and urethral openings, palpable gonads in the inguinal region, low testosterone, and low levels of basal and gnrh-stimulated gonadotropin. the second case had similar external genitalia, low testosterone but borderline basal and normal stimulated gonadotropin levels. low testosterone/androstenedione ratios (0.22 and 0.24, respectively; normal, >0.8) after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation indicated 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency. hsd17b3 sequencing revealed a homozygous novel mutation (c.464a>c, p.h155p) in exon 6 in the first case and homozygous c.239g>a (p.r80q) in exon 3 in the second.
low_testosterone	hypogonadism is common throughout the illness trajectory of patients with cancer. about two thirds of male patients with advanced cancer have hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction and low testosterone levels. chronic inflammation, comorbidities, cachexia, chemotherapy, and medications such as opioids, megestrol acetate, and corticosteroids contribute to primary and secondary hypogonadism. studies have reported increased symptom burden, diminished quality of life, and poor prognosis associated with low testosterone levels in males with cancer. the endocrine society has published clinical practice guidelines for replacing testosterone in symptomatic patients with chronic illness and in patients receiving opioids; however, the role of testosterone therapy specifically in patients with cancer is not addressed. this review explores the potential benefits and limitations of testosterone replacement on the basis of current evidence.
fungal_infection	granulocyte transfusions have a long history of being used in patients with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction to prevent and treat invasive fungal infections. however, there are limited and conflicting data concerning its clinical effectiveness, considerable variations in current granulocyte transfusion practices, and uncertainties about its benefit as an adjunct to modern antifungal therapy. in this review, we provide an overview on granulocyte transfusions and summarize the evidence on their role in the prevention and treatment of invasive fungal infections.
fungal_infection	background. solid organ transplant (sot) recipients are at risk of nocardiosis, a rare opportunistic bacterial infection, but prognosis and outcome of these patients are poorly defined. our objectives were to identify factors associated with 1-year mortality after nocardiosis and describe the outcome of patients receiving short-course antibiotics (<= 120 days). methods. we analyzed data from a multicenter european case-control study that included 117 sot recipients with nocardiosis diagnosed between 2000 and 2014. factors associated with 1-year all-cause mortality were identified using multivariable conditional logistic regression. results. one-year mortality was 10-fold higher in patients with nocardiosis (16.2%, 19/117) than in control transplant recipients (1.3%, 3/233, p<.001). a history of tumor (odds ratio [or], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-1.8), invasive fungal infection (or, 1.3; 95% ci, 1.1-1.5), and donor age (or, 1.0046; 95% ci, 1.0007-1.0083) were independently associated with 1-year mortality. acute rejection in the year before nocardiosis was associated with improved survival (or, 0.85; 95% ci, 0.73-0.98). seventeen patients received short-course antibiotics (median duration 56 [24-120] days) with a 1-year success rate (cured and surviving) of 88% and a 5.9% risk of relapse (median follow-up 49 [6-136] months). conclusions. one-year mortality was 10-fold higher in sot patients with nocardiosis than in those without. four factors, largely reflecting general medical condition rather than severity and/or management of nocardiosis, were independently associated with 1-year mortality. patients who received short-course antibiotic treatment had good outcomes, suggesting that this may be a strategy for further study.
fungal_infection	fungal infections like paecilomyces keratitis have emerged in childhood recently. the diagnosis and treatment of paecilomyces keratitis is difficult and the outcome is usually poor. corneal culture should be performed on fungal media such as sabouraud glucose neopeptone agar (sda) as soon as possible for diagnosis. we report a rare case of paecilomyces keratitis in an immunocompetent child, which was unresponsive to amphotericin b. the case was managed by a multidisciplinary approach involving the departments of ophthalmology, microbiology and pediatric infectious diseases. we want to draw attention once again that fungal keratitis caused by unusual agents are increasing. physicians should consider fungal causes of keratitis, in patients with some predisposing factors like ocular surgery and prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.
fungal_infection	objective. to investigate the spectrum, antibiotic-resistant pattern, risk factors, and outcomes of infection in patients hospitalized with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). methods. we collected the clinical and microbiological data from hospitalized patients with sle with infection between june 2005 and june 2015, and then conducted retrospective analyses. results. among our sample of 3815 hospitalized patients, 1321 (34.6%) were diagnosed with infection. the majority (78.3%) of infection occurred within 5 years of sle onset. bacterial infection was predominant (50.6%), followed by viral infection (36.4%) and fungal infection (12.5%). the lungs (33.7%) and upper respiratory tracts (26.3%) were most commonly affected. gram-negative bacteria (gnb) were predominant over gram-positive bacteria (178 isolates vs 90 isolates). the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli (24.6%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (13.4%) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (13.4%). multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains were detected in 26.9% of bacterial isolates. the most common fungus was candida spp. (99 episodes), followed by aspergillus (24 episodes) and cryptococcus neoformans (13 episodes). the overall mortality rate for this cohort was 2.2%; 48 patients died of infection. factors associated with bacterial and viral infection were higher systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index, renal involvement, thrombocytopenia, accumulated dose of glucocorticoids (gc), and treatment with cyclophosphamide (cyc). renal involvement, accumulated dose of gc, and treatment with cyc were associated with fungal infection. conclusion. infection was the leading cause of mortality in patients hospitalized with sle. there were some notable features of infection in chinese patients including early onset, higher proportion of respiratory tract involvement, predominance of gnb with emergence of mdr isolates, and a variety of pathogens.
fungal_infection	background: invasive fungal infection (ifi) is a fatal infection in haematology patients. there is an urgent need for reliable screening methods facilitating timely diagnosis and treatment. a real-time panfungal polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay based on taqman technology targeting 18s ribosomal rna gene was used to screen whole blood specimen obtained from series of haematology malignancy patients for ifis. materials and methods: the panfungal (pan-acf) assay was employed to investigate specimen from 133 patients in duplicate with suspected ifi. in addition twenty healthy subjects and twenty patients with bacterial infections were taken as control. the patients with suspected ifi were also diagnosed by conventional methods including direct microscopy, culture techniques and antigen detection (galactomannan antigen elisa and latex agglutination for cryptococcal antigen). the results of molecular testing were evaluated in relation to the criteria proposed by the european organization for research and treatment of cancer and patients were classified as having proven and probable ifd. results: of 133 patients, 89 had proven, 18 had probable and 26 had possible ifi. one hundred four samples were reverse transcription-pcr positive. of 89 proven cases, 84 were panfungal pcr positive. these 84 cases included 82 cases which revealed growth on fungal blood culture and two cases were negative on fungal blood culture. of the 82 cases which revealed growth on culture: 74 grew candida in culture, 3 grew fusarium solani, 5 grew aspergillus species on blood culture. the later five were also galactomannan antigen positive. the five specimen which were negative on panfungal pcr, two grew trichosporon asahii, one grew candida rugosa and two grew as cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. of the 18 probable cases, 18 were panfungal pcr positive. these were also galactomannan antigen positive. the sensitivity and specificity of panfungal pcr in proven cases were 94.3% and 95.2%, respectively. the positive and negative predictive values proven cases were 97.6% and 88.9%, respectively. conclusions: the panfungal (pan-acf) real-time pcr assay can detect common fungal genera and it may be used as an adjunct to conventional methods for screening of ifi.
diabetes	autoimmune diseases have a high prevalence in the population, and autoimmune thyroid disease (aitd) is one of the most common representatives. thyroid autoantibodies are not only frequently detected in patients with aitd but also in subjects without manifest thyroid dysfunction. the high prevalence raises questions regarding a potential role in extra -thyroidal diseases. this review summarizes the etiology and mechanism of aitd and addresses prevalence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, thyroid -stimulating hormone receptor (tshr), and anti-thyroglobulin and their action outside the thyroid. the main issues limiting the reliability of the conclusions drawn here include problems with different specificities and sensitivities of the antibody detection assays employed, as well as potential confounding effects of altered thyroid hormone levels, and lack of prospective studies. in addition to the well-known effects of tshr antibodies on fibroblasts in graves' disease (gd), studies speculate on a role of anti -thyroid antibodies in cancer. all antibodies may have a tumor -promoting role in breast cancer carcinogenesis despite anti -thyroid peroxidase antibodies having a positive prognostic effect in patients with overt disease. cross -reactivity with lactoperoxidase leading to induction of chronic inflammation might promote breast cancer, while anti -thyroid antibodies in manifest breast cancer might be an indication for a more active immune system. a better general health condition in older women with anti -thyroid peroxidase antibodies might support this hypothesis. the different actions of the anti -thyroid antibodies correspond to differences in cellular location of the antigens, titers of the circulating antibodies, duration of antibody exposure, and immunological mechanisms in gd and hashimoto 's thyroiditis.
diabetes	infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii (ab), an increasingly prevalent nosocomial pathogen, have been associated with high morbidity and mortality. we conducted this study to analyze the clinical features, outcomes, and factors influencing the survival of patients with ab bacteremia. we retrospectively examined the medical records of all patients developing ab bacteremia during their hospital stay at a tertiary care hospital in beirut between 2010 and 2015. ninety episodes of ab bacteremia were documented in eighty-five patients. univariate analysis showed that prior exposure to high dose steroids, diabetes mellitus, mechanical ventilation, prior use of colistin and tigecycline, presence of septic shock, and critical care unit stay were associated with a poor outcome. high dose steroids and presence of septic shock were significant on multivariate analysis. crude mortality rate was 63.5%. 70.3% of the deaths were attributed to the bacteremia. on acquisition, 39 patients had septicemia. despite high index of suspicion and initiation of colistin and/or tigecycline in 18/39 patients, a grim outcome could not be averted and 37 patients died within 2.16 days. seven patients had transient benign bacteremia; three of which were treated with removal of the line. the remaining four did not receive any antibiotics due to withdrawal of care and died within 26.25 days of acquiring the bacteremia, with no signs of persistent infection on follow up. a prolonged hospital stay is frequently associated with loss of functionality, and steroid and antibiotic exposure. these factors seem to impact the mortality of ab bacteremia, a disease with high mortality rate and limited therapeutic options.
diabetes	background and purpose it is now known that post-transplant graft function after deceased-donor liver transplantation and living-donor liver transplantation (ldlt) differ; however, there is no report assessing the relationship between graft function and the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (nodat). we conducted this study to identify the predictive risk factors for nodat, including graft function after ldlt. methods the subjects of this study were 175 adult recipients who underwent ldlt at kyoto university hospital between 2006 and 2010, and survived for more than 3 months (median observation period, 1046 days). results the 1-, 2-, and 3-year incidences of nodat after ldlt were 26.1, 32.0, and 33.4%, respectively. pre-transplant diabetes was associated with poor survival (p = 0.0048), whereas nodat was not associated with patient survival. in the multivariate analysis, recipient age >= 40, a tacrolimus trough level >= 8 ng/ml 3 months after ldlt, and cholinesterase (che) < 185 iu/l 3 months after ldlt were the independent risk factors for nodat. conclusions poor graft synthetic function 3 months after ldlt as well as older age of the recipient and a higher tacrolimus concentration were strongly associated with nodat development after ldlt.
diabetes	non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and can be considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. nafld represents a spectrum of disease, from the relatively benign simple steatosis to the more serious non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver failure, necessitating liver transplantation. although the increasing prevalence of nafld in developed countries has substantial implications for public health, many of the precise mechanisms accounting for the development and progression of nafld are unclear. the environment in early life is an important determinant of cardiovascular disease risk in later life and studies suggest this also extends to nafld. here we review data from animal models and human studies which suggest that fetal and early life exposure to maternal under- and overnutrition, excess glucocorticoids and environmental pollutants may confer an increased susceptibility to nafld development and progression in offspring and that such effects may be sex-specific. we also consider studies aimed at identifying potential dietary and pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing this risk. we suggest that further human epidemiological studies are needed to ensure that data from animal models are relevant to human health.
diabetes	endogenous alcohol has been applied for spontaneous ethanol production via different metabolic pathways of the human body. auto-brewery syndrome describes the patients with alcohol intoxication after ingesting carbohydrate-rich meals. the main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus (dm), liver cirrhosis (lc) and presence of both (dm and lc) on blood alcohol concentration (bac) especially after carbohydrate ingestion. bac has been measured by headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in three groups of humans namely control, dm, lc and both (dm and lc) groups. the results showed that bac in control group was 0.01-.3 mg/dl with mean 0.3 +/- 0.41 mg/dl. in patients with dm, bac is significantly higher than that of control group 4.85 +/- 3.96 mg/dl. in patients with lc, bac was 3.45 +/- 2.65 mg/dl. in patients with both dm and lc, bac increases to reach 10.88 +/- 5.36 mg/dl. endogenous ethanol production appears to increase in dm and lc. also, it increased much more in patients with both diseases, but it did not reach toxic levels. on comparing bac and blood glucose level in each group, all groups show insignificant correlations (p >0.05).
parenting	the increase in fathers' involvement in childrearing, particularly beyond infancy, warrants research exploring factors influencing the quality of child-father attachment relationships, and the impact of these relationships on children 's social development. the current investigation explored various correlates of preschoolers' child-father attachment security to both parents, including contextual factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, child temperament, parenting stress), parental play sensitivity, and child social adaptation. participants included 107 preschool-aged children (59 girls; m = 46.67 months, sd = 8.57) and their fathers and mothers. results revealed that both mothers' and fathers' play sensitivity were associated with child attachment security after controlling for different contextual factors. furthermore, the magnitude of the association between child conduct problems and child-father attachment insecurity was stronger than the corresponding association with child-mother attachment insecurity. findings provide important information on caregiving factors associated with child-father attachment security in the preschool years and the importance of this bond to children 's social adaptation.
parenting	this article explores pre-school reform and shifting norms of parenthood in singapore. whereas current education reforms in many western countries focus on improving academic performance, pre-school reform in singapore de-emphasises academic learning and urges parents to adopt 'relaxed' parenting practices. analysing the position of parents in this process, we show, however, that the outcomes of this reform project are highly ambivalent. reform makers view parents' mindset as the main obstacle to reform, while parents experience pre-school reform itself as prompting inconsistent messages. to account for the disorientation that this creates among parents, we draw on bateson 's concept of double bind.

parenting	aims: developing and evaluating an email-based intervention (ebi) to enhance alcohol-related parenting skills and reduce alcohol consumption among adolescents. methods: over four weeks, participating parents received a weekly email containing scientific findings, practical advice and exercises in relation to such topics as alcohol-related rule-setting and communication. using a randomised controlled trial (id: drks00007763), data from 467 parents and 173 adolescents were collected via self-report online questionnaires and analysed by means of repeated measures analysis of variance. findings: controlling for baseline, parents in the intervention group (ig) scored higher for being informed (parents of girls: f=19.023, p=0.000; parents of boys: f=30.294, p=0.000) and for self-efficacy (parents of girls: f=6.122, p=0.014; parents of boys: f=10.195, p=0.002) at follow-up and, in the case of boys, were more successful in maintaining strict rules on alcohol consumption (f=13.704, p=0.000) than parents in the control group (cg) (girls: f=1.627; p=0.204). boys whose parents were in the ig reported less heavy episodic drinking at follow-up (f=4.192, p=0.043), controlled for baseline, than those with parents in the cg (girls: f=0.567; p=0.454). conclusions: the ebi has positive effects on alcohol-related parenting and may reduce heavy episodic drinking among boys. since it is delivered via email, the programme has considerable potential to reach many parents at low cost.
parenting	one of the most important considerations in designing clinical infant research studies is the selection of reliable and valid measurement procedures. few measures of caregiver-child interactions have been studied with newborns, particularly premature infants. the main objective of this study was to examine psychometric properties of the national institute of child health and human development (nichd) mother-child interaction qualitative ratings in a sample of premature infants and their mothers to evaluate its use in the neonatal intensive care unit. mother-baby dyads (n = 24) were videotaped in a 10-min interaction in the nicu. nine raters independently assessed dyadic interactions using the nichd mother-child interaction qualitative ratings in a fully crossed research design. rater reliability was strong for mother and infant ratings (. 76-.94). scores yielded normal distributions for maternal sensitivity, positive regard, and flatness of affect and skewed distributions for maternal intrusiveness, detachment, negative regard, and all child ratings. positive maternal behaviors correlated positively with one another and negatively with negative maternal behaviors. thus, preliminary analyses suggest that scores obtained using the nichd mother-child interaction qualitative ratings with premature babies and their mothers in the neonatal intensive care unit demonstrate adequate interrater reliability, and distributional properties provide preliminary evidence of face validity.
parenting	objective: this study examined the prospective association of parental reports of intimate partner violence (ipv) involvement (perpetration and/or victimization) with offspring trauma symptoms an average of 6 years later and the moderating influence of positive and negative parenting. method: the children in the community study followed a representative sample of youth (generation 2) and their parents (generation 1) over 25 years, including their own offspring (generation 3) in the final 2 of these 7 assessments. the sample includes male (n = 92) and female (n = 151) original generation 2 study members who completed measures of ipv and had children (generation 3) by wave 5 (1999). parents completed measures of parenting at wave 6 (2001-2004), and child 's trauma symptoms at wave 7 (2006-08). results: ipv predicted child trauma symptoms, controlling for demographic risks. for fathers, but not mothers, this association held when controlling for stressful life events and psychopathology. ipv predicted lower positive and higher negative parenting practices. positive parenting moderated the association of ipv with child trauma symptoms. conclusion: childhood exposure to ipv between parents may increase the distal risk for trauma symptoms. ipv predicts more negative and less supportive parenting practices. positive parenting may be protective, though perhaps not at extreme levels of ipv.
birth_control	background: among adolescent pregnancies, 75% are unintended. greater use of highly-effective contraception can reduce unintended pregnancy. although multiple studies discuss adolescent contraceptive use, there is no consensus regarding the use of long-acting reversible contraception as a first-line contraception option. objective: we performed a systematic review of the medical literature to assess the continuation of long-acting reversible contraceptives among adolescents. study design: ovid-medline, cochrane databases, and embase databases were searched using key words relevant to the provision of long-acting contraception to adolescents. articles published from january 2002 through august 2016 were selected for inclusion based on specific key word searches and detailed review of bibliographies. for inclusion, articles must have provided data on method continuation, effectiveness, or satisfaction of at least 1 long-acting reversible contraceptive method in participants= 6 months. long-acting reversible contraceptive methods included intrauterine devices and the etonogestrel implant. only studies in the english language were included. guidelines, systematic reviews, and clinical reviews were examined for additional citations and relevant points for discussion. of 1677 articles initially identified, 90 were selected for full review. of these, 12 articles met criteria for inclusion. all studies selected for full review were extracted by multiple reviewers; inclusion was determined by consensus among authors. for studies with similar outcomes, forest plots of combined effect estimates were created using the random effects model. the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology guidelines were followed. primary outcomes measured were continuation of method at 12 months, and expulsion rates for intrauterine devices. results: this review included 12 studies, including 6 retrospective cohort studies, 5 prospective observational studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial. the 12 studies included 4886 women age <25 years: 4131 intrauterine device users and 755 implant users. the 12-month continuation of any long-acting reversible contraceptive device was 84.0% (95% confidence interval, 79.0-89.0%). intrauterine device continuation was 74.0% (95% confidence interval, 61.0-87.0%) and implant continuation was 84% (95% confidence interval, 77.0e91.0%). among postpartum adolescents, the 12-month long-acting reversible contraceptive continuation rate was 84.0% (95% confidence interval, 71.0-97.0%). the pooled intrauterine device expulsion rate was 8.0% (95% confidence interval, 4.0-11.0%). conclusion: adolescents and young women have high 12-month continuation of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods. intrauterine devices and implants should be offered to all adolescents as first-line contraceptive options.
birth_control	a method of birth control often called 'revolutionary' was implemented in many western countries in the 1960s. the contraceptive pill allowed women to engage in sexual experiences without the permanent fear of pregnancy. this safe method was especially important for the group of unmarried or newlywed women who were in the middle of their academic or vocational education and wanted to combine career and family life. in the 1970s, however, and especially under the influence of the women 's liberation movement, attitudes towards the pill changed. it was no longer seen as an emancipation of female sexuality, but as an instrument of the on-going male domination of sexuality and society in general. according to this point of view, issues such as sexuality and contraception that had so far been regarded as 'private' became political. women now directly linked their very personal intimate experiences and questions of power and gender relations in society, and this often meant stopping taking the pill. this article examines the particular reasons for the shift in contraceptive behaviour in west germany and england. it analyses the changing attitudes of feminist activists toward the pill and their influence on women 's decisions about birth control.
birth_control	average happiness in big cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants is, in the usa, lower than average happiness in towns and in the country. adam kozaryn offers several explanations. one explanation is that core characteristics of cities, such as size, density and heterogeneity lead to a deterioration of social relations. this explanation is insufficient because average happiness in cities can also be relatively high, as is the case in poor nations, compared to happiness in towns and in the country. important factors like relative safety and the availability of services have to be considered additionally. a second explanation is that capitalism plays a more dominant role in cities, with similar negative effects. this explanation is also insufficient because the negative effects of capitalism are not limited to cities. a more plausible explanation is that average happiness in american cities is relatively low, because of the interaction of their core characteristics and capitalism. more people should live in smaller places, but this is impossible. there are too many people and big cities are needed to minimize their ecological footprint. overpopulation is the root of the problem. a discussion about the maximum size of the population is needed. there is no reason to fear for a negative impact on individual freedom, but people can pay attention to this discussion if they make up their mind about having children.
birth_control	an historical analysis of reproductive politics in the canadian north during the 1970s necessitates a careful reading of the local circumstances regarding feminism, sovereignty, language, colonialism, and access to health services, which differed regionally and culturally. these features were conditioned, however, by international discussions on family planning that fixated on the twinned concepts of unchecked population growth and poverty. language from these debates crept into discussions about reproduction and birth control in northern canada, producing the state 's logic that, despite low population density, the endemic poverty in the north necessitated aggressive family planning measures.
birth_control	objectives: as life expectancy for women with cystic fibrosis (cf) improves, reproductive decision-making is becoming increasingly relevant. we sought to characterize fertility intentions, contraceptive use, and preferences among adult females with cf. study design: we conducted a cross-sectional survey of contraceptive use and preferences in reproductive-aged women with cf. subjects were recruited via an electronic mailing list from the penn adult cystic fibrosis program. results: fifty-three women with cf responded and met eligibility criteria. most (83%) were sexually active, however only 49% used contraception. condoms and the oral contraceptive pill were the most commonly used methods. compared to the national contraceptive use among caucasian women (65%), use in our cohort was significantly lower (p = 0.01). participants prioritized effectiveness and ease of use in their contraceptive method; they wanted to avoid side effects and interference with sexual enjoyment. although these priorities are similar to caucasian women in the literature, additional contraceptive priorities differed significantly between the groups. conclusions: this cf cohort is sexually active but contraceptive utilization was low, and women with cf identify specific contraceptive preferences. there is a significant unmet need for contraception among women with cf.

heart_disease	background in the syntax (synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with taxus and cardiac surgery) trial, patients with 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (cad) had improved long-term outcomes with coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) surgery compared with percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with drug-eluting stents (des), improvements driven mainly by differences in myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization. objectives this study compared the long-term quality-of-life benefits of des-pci versus cabg for patients with 3-vessel or left main cad. methods between 2005 and 2007, the syntax trial randomized 1,800 patients with 3-vessel or left main cad to either cabg or des-pci. health status was assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, 36, and 60 months by using the seattle angina questionnaire (saq) and the 36-item short form health survey. results at 5-year follow-up, cabg was superior to des-pci on several saq domains including angina frequency and physical function, as well as the role physical and role emotional scales of the 36-item short form health survey. subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between angiographic complexity (as assessed by the syntax score) and angina relief (mean difference in the saq angina frequency score for cabg vs. pci of -0.9, 3.3, and 3.9 points for low, intermediate, and high syntax score patients, respectively; p = 0.048 for interaction). conclusions among patients with 3-vessel or left main cad, both cabg and des-pci were associated with substantial and sustained quality-of-life benefits over 5 years of follow-up. in general, cabg resulted in greater angina relief, although the absolute treatment benefit was small. angina relief at 5 years was enhanced with cabg among patients with high syntax scores, a finding reinforcing the recommendation that cabg should be strongly preferred for such patients.

heart_disease	physiologic adaptations during pregnancy unmask a woman 's predisposition to diseases. complications are increasingly predicted by first-trimester algorithms, amplify a pre-existing maternal phenotype and accelerate risks for chronic diseases in the offspring up to adulthood (barker hypothesis). recent evidence suggests that vice versa, pregnancy diseases also indicate maternal and even grandparent 's risks for chronic diseases (reverse barker hypothesis). pub-med and embase were reviewed for mesh terms ""fetal programming"" and ""pregnancy complications combined with maternal disease"" until january 2017. studies linking pregnancy complications to future cardiovascular, metabolic, and thrombotic risks for mother and offspring were reviewed. women with a history of miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, subfertility, and thrombophilia more frequently demonstrate with echocardiographic abnormalities, higher fasting insulin, deviating lipids or clotting factors and show defective endothelial function. thrombophilia hints to thrombotic risks in later life. pregnancy abnormalities correlate with future cardiovascular and metabolic complications and earlier mortality. conversely, women with a normal pregnancy have lower rates of subsequent diseases than the general female population creating the term: ""pregnancy as a window for future health."" although the placenta works as a gatekeeper, many pregnancy complications may lead to sickness and earlier death in later life when the child becomes an adult. the epigenetic mechanisms and the mismatch between pre-and postnatal life have created the term ""fetal origin of adult disease."" up to now, the impact of cardiovascular, metabolic, or thrombotic risk profiles has been investigated separately for mother and child. in this manuscript, we strive to illustrate the consequences for both, fetus and mother within a cohesive perspective and thus try to demonstrate the complex interrelationship of genetics and epigenetics for long-term health of societies and future generations. maternal-fetal medicine specialists should have a key role in the prevention of non-communicable diseases by implementing a framework for patient consultation and interdisciplinary networks. health-care providers and policy makers should increasingly invest in a stratified primary prevention and follow-up to reduce the increasing number of manifest cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and to prevent waste of health-care resources.
heart_disease	the psychosocial environment and especially various psychosocial risks in childhood have been shown to predict later negative health behavior and health problems. in this study, we examined whether various psychosocial factor domains in childhood and adolescence: socioeconomic status, theemotional family environment (parental nurturance, life-satisfaction), parental lifestyle, life-events, the child 's self-regulatory behavior and the child 's social adaptation were associated with body mass index (bmi) trajectories individually by domain and as a cumulative score across domains. the participants were a nationally representative sample of 2016 men and women fromthe young finns study aged 3-18 years at study entry in 1980. their bmi wasmeasured at six study phases from 1980 to 2012. their parents reported all the factors related to their psychosocial environment in 1980. the participants responded to questions on adulthood socioeconomic status in 2007. the accumulation of psychosocial factors in childhood was the main exposure variable. the findings fromrepeated measuresmultilevelmodeling showed that parental lifestyle and life-events and the more positive cumulative psychosocial factors score were associated with a slower increase in bmi during follow-up (regression coefficient range from - 0.06 to -0.50). in conclusion, the psychosocial environment in childhood and adolescence, particularly parental lifestyle and lack of stressful life-events, are associated with a lower increase of bmi.

heart_disease	recent insights into the bioactivation and signaling actions of inorganic, dietary nitrate and nitrite now suggest a critical role for the microbiome in the development of cardiac and pulmonary vascular diseases. once thought to be the inert, end-products of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (no) heme-oxidation, nitrate and nitrite are now considered major sources of exogenous no that exhibit enhanced vasoactive signaling activity under conditions of hypoxia and stress. the bioavailability of nitrate and nitrite depend on the enzymatic reduction of nitrate to nitrite by a unique set of bacterial nitrate reductase enzymes possessed by specific bacterial populations in the mammalian mouth and gut. the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (ph), obesity, hypertension and cvd are linked to defects in no signaling, suggesting a role for commensal oral bacteria to shape the development of ph through the formation of nitrite, no and other bioactive nitrogen oxides. oral supplementation with inorganic nitrate or nitrate-containing foods exert pleiotropic, beneficial vascular effects in the setting of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, ischemia-reperfusion injury and in pre-clinical models of ph, while traditional high-nitrate dietary patterns are associated with beneficial outcomes in hypertension, obesity and cvd. these observations highlight the potential of the microbiome in the development of novel nitrate-and nitrite-based therapeutics for ph, cvd and their risk factors.
heart_disease	objective: unusual clinical course background: acute coronary syndrome (acs) can present with atypical chest pain or symptoms not attributed to heart disease, such as indigestion. hiccups, a benign and self-limited condition, can become persistent or intractable with overlooked underlying etiology. there are various causes of protracted hiccups, including metabolic abnormalities, psychogenic disorders, malignancy, central nervous system pathology, medications, pulmonary disorders, or gastrointestinal etiologies. it is rarely attributed to cardiac disease. case report: we report a case of intractable hiccups in a 51-year-old male with cocaine related myocardial infarction (mi) before and after stent placement. coronary angiogram showed in-stent thrombosis of the initial intervention. following thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty, and stent, the patient recovered well without additional episodes of hiccups. although hiccups are not known to present with a predilection for a particular cause of myocardial ischemia, this case may additionally be explained by the sympathomimetic effects of cocaine, which lead to vasoconstriction of coronary arteries. conclusions: hiccups associated with cardiac enzyme elevation and ekg st-segment elevation before and after percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) maybe a manifestation of acute mi with or without stent. the fact that this patient was a cocaine user may have contributed to the unique presentation.
allergies	aim: we previously reported a protective effect of maternal omega-3 fatty acid supplements on the development of immunoglobulin e (ige)-associated disease in infancy. this study assessed omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa) in maternal milk in relation to omega-3 lcpufa supplementation and the development of allergic disease in their infants. methods: this study randomised 95 pregnant women at risk of having an allergic infant, to daily supplements of 2.6 g omega-3 lcpufa or a placebo of 2.7 g soya bean oil from gestational week 25 until 3 months of lactation. breast milk samples were collected as colostrum, at one and 3 months. milk fatty acids were related to allergic outcome in the infants at 24 months. results: omega-3 milk fatty acids were higher in women who received omega-3 supplements than the placebo group (p < 0.01). higher proportions of milk eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and a lower arachidonic/ eicosapentaenoic acid ratio were associated with an absence of ige-associated disease in the infants. none of the children developed ige-associated atopic eczema above a level of 0.83 mol% eicosapentaenoic acid in colostrum. [correction added on 7 july 2016, after online publication: in the preceding sentence, the correct word should be "" above"" instead of "" below"" and this has been amended in this current version.] conclusion: high omega-3 lcpufa milk levels in mothers who received omega-3 lcpufa supplements were related to fewer allergies in their children.
allergies	the aim of this study was to determine if extracts from selected spices (caraway, ginger, chili, sweet peppers, anise, sesame, nutmeg and black pepper) might be harmful to people suffering from celiac disease, wheat allergy or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. all of these spice extracts exhibited some reaction to antibodies found in sera from two celiac patients and to sera from rabbits that had been sensitized with the specific peptides, qqqpp, pqqq and qqqp. these peptides had sequences that might be included in active epitopes for celiac disease and wheat allergy. methodology followed in this study included elisa, sds-page and immunoblotting. the observed reactivities suggest that spice proteins might produce adverse reactions in celiac patients, patients with various wheat allergies or with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. however, further work would be needed to elucidate this possibility.
allergies	the effects of tissue type, harvest maturity, and genetic factors on the expression of genes that related to citrus fruit allergies remain poorly understood. in the present study, a multiplex real-time pcr assay was developed to monitor the expression of citrus allergen genes individually with the advantages of much fewer sample requirements and simultaneously multiple target genes detection. gene specific primer pairs and taqman probes of three citrus allergen genes cit s 1.01, cit s 2.01, and cit s 3.01 and the house-keeping gene beta-actin were designed based on gene sequence differences. the pcr results showed that differential expression patterns were found during the ripening process. the expression levels of cit s 3.01 were much higher than those of cit s 1.01 and cit s 2.01 in both peel and pulp tissues among 10 citrus cultivars. data suggested that kao phuang pummelo could be safely consumed with a potential low risk in allergenicity. considering that assessing allergenicity is one of the tests in food safety, this assay might also facilitate the breeding and production of ""allergy-friendly"" citrus fruits.
allergies	herein we present a retrospective study concerning the provision of school meals for children with food allergies to avoid specially selected menus where these did not seem essential and to improve the day-to-day quality of life of these children and their families. eighty-two children aged between 3 and 15 years presenting food allergies, primarily to peanuts and/or cashew nuts, partook of school meals without any specially prepared menus as part of the individualised meal project (projet d'accueil individualise [paid following a study concerning the reading of menus, conducted with the help of school doctors within the region as well as the various bodies responsible for school meals. based on advances in knowledge about and treatment of food allergies (fa) in recent years, we felt it was essential to be able to provide a personalised school meal service taking into account the serious nature of fa, french dietary habits and available data concerning allergic accidents associated with school meals.

allergies	at birth the piglet 's immune system is immature and it is dependent upon passive maternal protection until weaning. the piglet 's mucosal immune system develops over the first few weeks but has not reached maturity at weaning ages which are common on commercial farms. at weaning piglets are presented with a vast and diverse range of microbial and dietary/environmental antigens. their ability to distinguish between antigens and mount a protective response to potential pathogens and to develop tolerance to dietary antigens is critical to their survival and failure to do so is reflected in the high incidence of morbidity and mortality in the post-weaning period. a growing recognition that the widespread use of antibiotics to control infection during this critical period should be controlled has led to detailed studies of those factors which drive the development of the mucosal immune system, the role of gut microbiota in driving this process, the origin of the bacteria that colonise the young piglet 's intestine and the impact of rearing environment. this review briefly describes how the mucosal immune system is equipped to respond ""appropriately"" to antigenic challenge and the programmed sequence by which it develops. the results of studies on the critical interplay between the host immune system and gut microbiota are discussed along with the effects of rearing environment. by comparing these with results from human studies on the development of allergies in children, an approach to promote an earlier maturation of the piglet immune system to resist the challenges of weaning are outlined.
menopause	luteinizing hormone (lh) rises dramatically during and after menopause, and has been correlated with an increased incidence of alzheimer 's disease and decreased memory performance in humans and animal models. to test whether lh acts directly on the dorsal hippocampus to affect memory, ovariectomized female rats were infused with either the lh-homologue human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) or the lh receptor antagonist deglycosylated-hcg (dg-hcg). infusion of hcg into either the lateral ventricle or the dorsal hippocampus caused significant memory impairments in ovariectomized estradiol-treated females. consistent with this, infusion of the lh antagonist dg-hcg into the dorsal hippocampus caused an amelioration of memory deficits in ovariectomized females. furthermore, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist antide, failed to act in the hippo campus to affect memory. these findings demonstrate a significant role for lh action in the dorsal hippocampus in spatial memory dysfunction.

menopause	endometriosis is an uncommon disease in postmenopausal women (pmw), ranging from 2% to 5% of cases, and it is very important to exclude neoplastic transformation of the endometrium. the authors would like to introduce the case of a 63-year-old overweight patient with abdominal pain associated to pain and swelling of the left inferior limb occurring for approximately six weeks. the ct x-ray of the abdomen revealed the presence of a retroperitoneal mass causing deep vein thrombosis because of extrinsic compression of the left iliac vein. following removal of the pelvic masses with laparotomy, the histological exam revealed an endometriosis. the ct x-ray carried out after a month postoperatively revealed the root canal treatment of the left femoral vein with a considerable decrease of the thrombosis of homolateral external iliac veins. despite the endometriosis, it is uncommon in women who have reached menopause and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of pelvic masses.
menopause	objectives: to examine relationships between location, demographics, lifestyle, beliefs, and experience of hot flushes and night sweats (hfns) amongst women living in two cities in thailand. methods: cross-sectional study of peri- and postmenopausal women, aged 45-55 years, from bangkok and chiang mai. participants completed questionnaires (demographics, health, hfns (prevalence, frequency and problem-rating) and beliefs about menopause). a sub-sample of women from each location was interviewed. results: a total of 632 women (320 bangkok and 312 chiang mai) aged 50.88 (standard deviation 3.06) years, took part. the prevalence of hfns was 65%, average hfns frequency 8.7 (10.8) per week and problem rating 4.3/10. women from chiang mai had significantly more problematic hfns, but prevalence and frequency were similar in both sites. poor general health predicted hfns prevalence and frequency, while chiang mai location, hfns frequency, age, diet and beliefs about menopause were associated with problematic hfns. location remained significant after controlling for education, occupation and age; location was partially explained by beliefs. qualitative interview responses illustrated the differences in beliefs about menopause between locations. conclusion: hfns reports are prevalent with moderate frequency and problem-ratings in these urban centers in thailand. the results will be included in the broader international menopause society study of climate, altitude and temperature (ims-cat) of the impact of climate on hfns.
menopause	background some studies have already proposed an inverse association between vitamin d levels and breast density. as breast density is already considered an established risk factor for breast cancer, such a connection could offer a new starting point for the prevention of breast cancer. material and methods to investigate this suggested connection, a total of 412 pre- and 572 post-menopausal women for whom mammography was indicated were recruited into this cross-sectional study. in addition to a questionnaire-based interview on the patient 's general and gynecological medical history, her eating habits and lifestyle, serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d], calcium, phosphate and creatinine were determined. breast density was determined by mammography and categorized as 1 to 4 according to the acr classification. in addition to performing descriptive analysis to get a better overview of the data, a number of multivariate regression models were developed to determine the impact of confounders and the connection between vitamin d and mammographic density. results more than half of all participants had low levels of 25(oh)d (< 20 ng/ml) and only a small minority of women (5.7%) had what are currently considered to be optimal serum levels of 25(oh)d of at least 30 ng/ml. the significant majority of the cohort had a medium mammographic density (n = 463 had acr 2; n = 343 had acr 3). logistic regression analysis showed that lower 25(oh)d serum levels were associated significantly more often with high rather than medium breast density. this association remained, even after adjusting for other factors which influence breast density such as age, bmi and menopausal status (p = 0.032 for acr 4 vs. acr 2; p = 0.028 for acr 4 vs. acr 3). when the same analysis was done separately for pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women, bmi in both groups was found to be inversely correlated with breast density and this inverse correlation was highly significant. in post-menopausal women, age was found to be similarly correlated while 25(oh)d did not appear to be associated with acr. in pre-menopausal women the opposite was the case: although there was no correlation between age and breast density, higher vitamin d levels tended to be associated with lower breast density (p = 0.06 for acr 2 vs. acr 4) in this smaller sample (n = 412). when vitamin d-rich food and food supplements were also taken into account, regular intake of vitamin d preparations was associated with lower breast density; this association achieved borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05 for acr 3 vs. acr 4). when the analysis also took menopausal status into account, the breast density of pre-menopausal women was lower following regular vitamin d intake and this lower breast density of pre-menopausal women was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001 for acr 1 and acr 2 vs. acr 4, respectively). this effect was not found in post-menopausal women. frequent intake of vitamin d-containing nutrition had no significant impact on acr in either of the groups. conclusion these results reinforce the assumption previously proposed by several authors that higher levels of 25(oh)d pre-menopause and vitamin d substitution are associated with lower breast density and could reduce the risk of breast cancer. the findings did not confirm any post-menopausal association between vitamin d and mammographic breast density.
menopause	objectives: to examine trends in the relationship between smoking history and both general and central fatness in adults from a mediterranean setting. materials and methods: the encat 1992-1993 and 2002-2003 surveys were used; samples consisted of 482 men, 589 women from 1992-1993, and 515 men, 613 women from 2002-2003, aged 25-60 years. measured anthropometry and self-reported data on smoking habits, diet, lifestyle and ses were collected. general fatness was defined as who 's bmi overweight and obesity, and central fatness was defined as who 's increased-risk-for-metabolic-complications waist circumference (ir wc) and substantially-increased-risk wc (sir wc). simple logistic regression was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted associations between general/central fatness and smoking history. results: by 2002-2003, most associations observed in 1992-1993 had been strongly attenuated: only male current-heavy-smoking remained associated with ir/sir wc (three-fold) and female current-moderate-smokers were 0.57 times less likely to have an ir/sir wc (p <0.10). conclusions: although causality cannot be established, results suggest a positive association between heavy smoking and central fatness among men, but no association between former smoking and general/central fatness; findings strengthen arguments for promoting smoking cessation to reduce smoking and obesity associated morbidity and mortality
emergency_contraception	can administration of a prostaglandin (pg) e2 receptor 2 (ptger2) antagonist prevent pregnancy in adult female monkeys by blocking periovulatory events in the follicle without altering menstrual cyclicity or general health? this is the first study to demonstrate that a ptger2 antagonist can serve as an effective non-hormonal contraceptive in primates. the requirement for pge2 in ovulation and the release of an oocyte surrounded by expanded cumulus cells (cumulus-oocyte expansion; c-oe) was established through the generation of ptgs2 and ptger2 null-mutant mice. a critical role for pge2 in primate ovulation is supported by evidence that intrafollicular injection of indomethacin in rhesus monkeys suppressed follicle rupture, whereas co-injection of pge2 with indomethacin resulted in ovulation. first, controlled ovulation protocols were performed in adult, female rhesus monkeys to analyze the mrna levels for genes encoding pge2 synthesis and signaling components in the naturally selected pre-ovulatory follicle at different times after the ovulatory hcg stimulus (0, 12, 24, 36 h pre-ovulation; 36 h post-ovulation, n = 3-4/time point). second, controlled ovarian stimulation cycles were utilized to obtain multiple cumulus-oocyte complexes (cocs) from rhesus monkeys to evaluate the role of pge2 in c-oe in vitro (n = 3-4 animals/treatment; a parts per thousand yen3 cocs/animal/treatment). third, adult cycling female cynomolgus macaques were randomly assigned (n = 10/group) to vehicle (control) or ptger2 antagonist (bay06) groups to perform a contraceptive trial. after the first treatment cycle, a male of proven fertility was introduced into each group and they remained housed together for the duration of the 5-month contraceptive trial that was followed by a post-treatment reversibility trial. quantitative real-time pcr, coc culture and expansion, immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy, enzyme immunoassay, contraceptive trial, ultrasonography, complete blood counts, serum biochemistry tests and blood lipid profiles. several mrnas encoding proteins involved in pge2 synthesis, metabolism and signaling increase (p < 0.05) in the periovulatory follicle after administration of an ovulatory hcg bolus. pge2 signaling through ptger2 induces cumulus cell expansion and production of hyaluronic acid, which are critical events for fertilization. moreover, chronic administration of a selective ptger2 antagonist resulted in a significant (p < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated controls) contraceptive effect without altering steroid hormone patterns or menstrual cyclicity during a 5-months contraceptive trial. fertility recovered as early as 1 month after ending treatment. this is a proof-of-concept study in a non-human primate model. further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanism(s) of ptger2 antagonist action in the primate ovary. although ptger2 antagonist treatment did not produce any obvious undesirable effects, improvements in the mode of administration, as well as the efficacy of these compounds, are necessary to consider such a contraceptive for women. monitoring as well as improving the efficacy and safety of female contraceptives is an important public health activity. even though hormonal contraceptives are effective for women, concerns remain regarding their side-effects and long-term use because of the widespread actions of such steroidal products in many tissues. moreover, some women cannot take hormones for medical reasons. thus, development of non-hormonal contraceptives for women is warranted. supported by bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals, the eunice kennedy shriver nichd contraceptive development and research center (u54 hd055744), nih office of the director (oregon national primate research center p51 od011092), and a lalor foundation postdoctoral basic research fellowship (mcp). the use of the leica confocal was supported by grant number s10rr024585. some of the authors (n.b., a.r., k.-h.f., u.f., b.b. and b.l.) are employees of bayer healthcare pharma.
emergency_contraception	this paper presents the public health rationale for multipurpose prevention technologies (mpts) for sexual and reproductive health (srh) based on regional trends in demographic and srh indicators. it then distils important lessons gleaned from the introduction of contraceptive and reproductive health products over the past several decades in order to inform the development and future introduction of mpts for srh. principal results: a comparison of current demographic and public health regional data clearly revealed that the greatest confluence of women 's srh concerns occurs in sub-saharan africa and south/west asia. these regional overlaps of srh risks and outcomes present a strong rationale for developing mpts designed to simultaneously protect against unintended pregnancy, hiv and other stis. information from acceptability, marketing, and operations research on the female condom, emergency contraception, pills and intravaginal rings identified key product characteristics and socio-behavioral issues to be considered in the development and introduction of mpts. product characteristics such as formulation, duration of action, presence and magnitude of side effects, prescription status (over-the-counter vs. prescribed), provider type and training and user perspectives, all contributed in varying degrees to both provider and user bias, and subsequent uptake of these family planning methods. underlying socio-behavioral issues, including risk perception, ambivalence, and social costs also contributed to demand and use. early identification of target populations will be critical to market shaping, demand creation and defining appropriate service delivery channels for mpts. ultimately, knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices of users (and their partners) will drive the success-or failure-of product introduction. conclusions: mpts provide a compelling response to the multiple and reinforcing srh risks faced by women in key regions of the world, but specific product characteristics and their socio-behavioral correlates must be taken into account early in the development process. successful introduction of new mpts will require solid understanding of socio-behavioral correlates, effective demand generation, appropriate integration into health service delivery systems, quality counseling for proper use and active engagement of both public and private sectors. this article is based on a presentation at the ""product development workshop 2013: hiv and multipurpose prevention technologies,"" held in arlington, virginia on february 21-22, 2013. it forms part of a special supplement to antiviral research.

emergency_contraception	objectives this paper highlights lessons from introductory efforts and presents new data on community, provider and key opinion leader perspectives to support expanded use of emergency contraception (ec) in senegal. sources of information the paper draws on four data sources: (i) a literature review; (ii) a secondary analysis of a household survey conducted by the urban reproductive health initiative; (iii) in-depth interviews with key opinion leaders; and (iv) a quantitative survey of healthcare providers from a range of service delivery points. analysis of data knowledge of ec among women is low in urban areas, with only 20% of women having heard of the method and 4% having ever used it. there were serious gaps in providers' technical knowledge about ec; only 57% knew its mode of action and 34% were aware of the need for timely use (within 120 h). moreover, nearly half reported reluctance to provide ec to married women and even fewer were willing to provide it to youths, particularly to adolescent girls. responses from key opinion leaders were mixed, demonstrating ambivalence about ec and how it could be offered. conclusion in senegal, the current positive political climate for family planning provides a good opportunity for strengthening ec programming to address knowledge and attitudinal barriers among providers, key opinion leaders and communities.
emergency_contraception	background: health service providers can restrict access to contraceptives through their own imposed biases about method appropriateness. in this study, provider biases toward contraceptive service provision among urban nigerian providers was assessed. methods: health providers working in health facilities, as well as pharmacists and patent medical vendors (pmv), in abuja, benin city, ibadan, ilorin, kaduna, and zaria, were surveyed in 2011 concerning their self-reported biases in service provision based on age, parity, and marital status. results: minimum age bias was the most common bias while minimum parity was the least common bias reported by providers. condoms were consistently provided with the least amount of bias, followed by provision of emergency contraception (ec), pills, injectables, and iuds. experience of in-service training for health facility providers was associated with decreased prevalence of marital status bias for the pill, injectable, and iud; however, training experience did not, or had the opposite effect on, pharmacists and pmv operator 's reports of service provision bias. conclusions: provider imposed eligibility barriers in urban study sites in nigeria were pervasive - the most prevalent restriction across method and provider type was minimum age. given the large and growing adolescent population interventions aimed at increasing supportive provision of contraceptives to youth in this context are urgently needed. the results show that the effect of in-service training on provider biases was limited. future efforts to address provider biases in contraceptive service provision, among all provider types, must find creative ways to address this critical barrier to increased contraceptive use.
skin_care	job-related hand dermatitis heads up the list of reported occupational diseases. so-called skin products - understood to mean protective creams, skin cleansers and skin care products - are used for the primary and secondary prevention of job-related hand dermatitis. in the interests of evidence-based medicine, the only preventive measures and/or occupational skin products that should be used are those whose potential uses and efficacy are underpinned by scientific research. to this end, the arbeitsgemeinschaft fur berufs-und umweltdermatologie e. v. (working group for occupational and environmental dermatology, abd) of the ddg (german dermatological society) and the deutsche gesellschaft fur arbeits - und umweltmedizin (german society for occupational and environmental medicine, dgaum) have summed up the latest scientific findings and recommendations in the updated guideline. the benefit of the combined application of protective creams and skin care products in the primary and secondary prevention of work-related contact dermatitis has been widely confirmed by recent clinical-epidemiological studies. the guideline clearly explains the necessity of demonstrating the efficacy of protective creams and cleansing products by means of in vivo methods in the sense of repetitive applications. transferable standardised testing systems designed to examine the irritation potential and thus the compatibility of occupational skin cleansers and the reduction of irritation by protective skin creams have now been developed and validated by multicentre studies for skin protection creams and cleansers. the status of the current assessment of the safety of occupational skin products is also summarised.
skin_care	objective: we assessed the knowledge level and skills of trained ashas in providing home-based newborn care. methods: 100 asha from two talukas of anand district of gujarat participated. knowledge was assessed using a structured questionnaire while certain skills were assessed through direct observation on mannequins. results: the mean (sd) knowledge score of the participants was 16.7(3.16) out of 34. the skills were satisfactory in 52%, 61%, 43%, and 68% of asha workers for temperature measurement, hand washing, weight measurement and skin-to-skin care, respectively. large variability was observed in self reported and field performance of asha workers. conclusions: knowledge and skills of asha workers in this region were inadequate.
skin_care	background: skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant, commonly referred to as kangaroo care (kc), has demonstrated efficacy as a pain-relieving strategy for infants, yet, it remains underutilized in clinical practice. purpose: to evaluate changes in neonatal intensive care unit staff nurse beliefs, utilization, and challenges related to practice change in implementing kc as an intervention for management of procedural pain in preterm infants between 2 time points. methods: nurses who participated in a larger clinical trial examining the sustained efficacy of kc were asked to complete a questionnaire at 2 time points: 1-and 6 month(s) following study initiation. identified benefits, expectations, frequency of use, and challenges related to practice change uptake were described using frequencies and percentages. data from the 2 different time points were compared using. 2 analysis. results: of the 40 nurses approached, all completed the questionnaire (19 at the 1-month and 21 at the 6-month time point). of the sample (n = 40), 97% of participants indicated that they expected kc to provide good pain relief or better. staff nurses reported significantly improved preconceived ideas (chi(2) = 22.68, p <.01) and significantly fewer concerns (chi(2) = 22.10, p =.01) related to using kc as a pain-relieving intervention between the 2 time points. no significant differences were seen in the frequency of using kc as an intervention between time points. implications for research and practice: despite increasingly positive preconceived ideas and reduced concerns, the frequency of using kc for procedural pain relief remained unchanged. further research addressing ways to overcome barriers to utilizing kc as an intervention for procedural pain is warranted.
skin_care	background: the period of infancy, spanning through the neonatal stage to two years, is characterized by a series of health challenges for the affected child and concerned parents. this study conducted in odeda local government area of ogun state, nigeria was aimed at investigating the plants used in the traditional management of infantile dermatitis and other neonatal skin infections with emphasis on the role of spices. methods: structured questionnaires (and personal interview) were administered to 36 nursing mothers (age range, 15 - 50) and 30 herbsellers (age range, 21 - 60) in the lga. the herbsellers prescribed recipes used in the management of general skin diseases including abscess, chicken pox, eczema, flaky skin spots, measles, rashes, ringworm, and small pox. results: the survey yielded 69 plants belonging to 38 families and forming 25 polyherbal and mono-recipes. fabaceae, rutaceae, euphorbiaceae, annonaceae, poaceae, meliaceae, and amaryllidaceae had high species representation. trees (40.58%) were the most frequently used plant habit while leaves (40.58%) formed the most frequently used plant part. decoction and infusion using pure water were the methods of preparation suggested. administration ranged from drinking extracts (2-3 teaspoonfuls) three times daily, to bathing with warm extracts of the plants and the use of coconut oil as cream. traditional black soap and shea butter also featured in the herbal remedy for bath and as cream respectively. local sponge was preferred for bathing. conclusion: this study has documented the alternative medical approach in the management of infantile skin diseases. the cultural relevance of plants calls for sustainable use of plant resources. this research finds application in primary health care, microbiology, and in cosmetic industries for the development of new or improved baby skin care products. further research should be conducted to confirm the claimed ethnomedicinal values as well as evaluate possible harm of crude plant extracts to skin structures of infants.
skin_care	nowadays, the consumers around the world are increasingly focused on health and beauty. the renewed consumer interest in natural cosmetic products creates the demand for new products and reformulated others with botanical and functional ingredients. in cosmetic products, essential oils (eos) play a major role as fragrance ingredients. they can optimize its proprieties and preservation, as well as the marketing image of the final product. microencapsulation of eos can protect and prevent the loss of volatile aromatic ingredients and improve the controlled release and stability of this core materials. the importance of eos for cosmetic industry and its microencapsulation was reviewed in this study. also a briefly introduction about the preparation of microparticles was presented. some of the most important and usual microencapsulation techniques of eos, as well as the conventional encapsulating agents, were discussed. despite the fact that microencapsulation of eos is a very promising and extremely attractive application area for cosmetic industry, further basic research needs to be carried out, for a better understanding of the biofunctional activities of microencapsulated eos and its release modulation, as well as the effects of others cosmetic ingredients and the storage time in the microparticles properties.
myelofibrosis	backgroundthis analysis of the myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn) landmark survey evaluated gaps between patient perceptions of their disease management and physician self-reported practices. methodsthe survey included 813 patient respondents who had mpns (myelofibrosis [mf], polycythemia vera [pv], or essential thrombocythemia [et]) and 457 hematologist/oncologist respondents who treated patients with these conditions. resultsgreater proportions of physician respondents reported using prognostic risk classifications (mf, 83%; pv, 59%; et, 77%) compared with patient recollections (mf, 54%; pv, 17%; et, 31%). most physician respondents reported that their typical symptom assessments included asking patients about the most important symptoms or a full list of symptoms, whereas many patient respondents reported less specific assessments (eg, they were asked how they were feeling). many patient respondents did not recognize common symptoms as mpn-related. for example, approximately one-half or more did not believe difficulty sleeping resulted from their mpn (mf, 49%; pv, 64%; et, 76%). physician respondents underestimated the proportion of patients who had symptomatic pv or et at diagnosis compared with patient respondents. there was discordance regarding treatment goals: among patient respondents with mf or pv, slow/delay progression of condition was the most important treatment goal, whereas physician respondents reported symptom improvement and prevention of vascular/thrombotic events, respectively. finally, more than one-third of patient respondents were not very satisfied with their physician 's overall management/communication. conclusionsthe care and satisfaction of patients with mpn may be improved with increased patient education and improved patient-physician communication. cancer 2017;123:449-458. (c) 2016 the authors. cancer published by wiley periodicals, inc. on behalf of american cancer society. this analysis of data from the myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn) landmark survey identified important gaps in patient and physician respondent perceptions about mpns. discordance in patient and physician respondent perceptions was observed in mpn-related prognostic risk assessment, symptom burden, treatment goals and expectations, and treatment satisfaction.
myelofibrosis	identification of somatic frameshift mutations in exon 9 of the calreticulin gene (calr) in myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) in december of 2013 has been a remarkable finding. it has provided a new molecular diagnostic marker, particularly in essential thrombocythemia (et) and primary myelofibrosis (pmf), where is the second most common altered gene after jak2v617f. there are two main types of calr mutants, type 1 and type 2, and there is evidence about their distinct clinical/prognostic implications, for instances, it is believed that favorable outcome might be restricted to type-1 in pmf. by using reasoned approaches, very recent publications have supported classifying the alternative mutants in type-1-like or type-2-like. if further studies confirm these results, new considerations may be taken into account in the molecular diagnosis of mpns. this implies that precise mutation characterization must be performed and caution should be taken in screening technique selection. in this editorial we summarize the current information regarding all this issues.
myelofibrosis	background true essential thrombocythemia (et) may carry one of the known driver mutations (jak2, mpl and calr) or none of them [in triple-negative (3neg) cases]. the patients' mutational status seems to delineate the clinical manifestations of et. materials and methods we report the data of 183 patients diagnosed with et strictly according to the who 2008 criteria and with a full molecular diagnosis, including the following: 114 patients (62.3%) with jak2v617f; 25 (13.7%) with calr type 1 and 19 (10.4%) with calr type 2; 3 (1.6%) with mpl; 22 (12%) who were 3neg. thrombotic risk was assessed by means of the ipset-thrombosis score (ipset-t). results calr and 3neg patients had lower haemoglobin levels and leucocyte count than jak2 patients. calr patients, and those with type 2 in particular, had higher mean platelet counts and had extreme thrombocytosis more often than any of the other groups. based on their ipset-t stratification, 3neg- and calr-mutated patients belonged more frequently to the low-risk group and had a significant more favourable thrombosis-free survival rate than those with jak2 mutation. conclusion these findings indicate that the three different molecular markers have a significant impact on the clinical course of true et, giving rise to different phenotypes of the same disease.
myelofibrosis	in this study, we investigate if chronic inflammation and autoimmunity might be related to the development of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml). conducting a case-control study, we included 112 cmml subjects diagnosed at three hematological departments in denmark between 2003 and 2013. controls were 231 unmatched chronic lymphatic leukemia (cll) subjects diagnosed at one of the departments between 2003 and 2012. subjects with a history of chronic inflammation or autoimmune disorders were retrieved and odds ratios (ors) calculated. 16.1% of cmml subjects and 6.5% of cll subjects presented with a history of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. this was significantly associated with an increased risk of cmml (adjusted or 3.24, 95% ci: 1.5-7.0). at individual levels, this association was statistically significant for polymyalgia rheumatica and itp (p values < 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). we found an association of cmml and smoking status (or 1.42, 95% ci: 1.06-1.90) with more former smokers in the cmml group.
myelofibrosis	essential thrombocythemia (et) is a rare clonal myeloproliferative disorder with a prevalence rate of approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 individuals per year. et is characterized by a persistent increase in the platelet count with hyperplasia of bone marrow megakaryocytes. it is difficult to make a diagnosis of et, because most thrombocythemia are reactive to certain disease conditions including iron deficiency anemia, infection, collagen diseases and malignant tumors. mutation in the janus kinase (jak)2 gene is present in approximately 50-70% of et patients, and somatic mutations in the calreticulin (calr) gene were recently discovered in approximately 20-25% of sporadic patients with et or primary myelofibrosis. various cutaneous manifestations of et often occur by microvascular thrombosis and precede severe arterial and venous thromboembolic events in other organs. therefore, in order to prevent such severe events, it is important to make an early diagnosis of et based on a number of cutaneous manifestations. here, we report two cases of et diagnosed based on livedo racemosa on feet with gene mutations in jak2 and calr, respectively, and show the pathological and immunohistological findings of the livedo resulting from platelet thrombosis rather than vasculitis. we also review the cutaneous manifestations in current published reports of japanese et patients. our patients were successfully treated with low-dose aspirin, a vasodepressor and hydroxyurea, following regressed livedo and reduced platelet counts.
hypothyroidism	thyroid hormones have an influence on the functioning of the central nervous system. furthermore, the cholinergic and purinergic systems also are extensively involved in brain function. in this context, quercetin is a polyphenol with antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. this study investigated the effects of (mmi)-induced hypothyroidism on the ntpdase, 5'-nucleotidase, adenosine deaminase (ada), and acetylcholinesterase (ache) activities in synaptosomes of rats and whether the quercetin can prevent it. mmi at a concentration of 20 mg/100 ml was administered for 90 days in the drinking water. the animals were divided into six groups: control/water (ct/w), control/quercetin 10 mg/kg, control/quercetin 25 mg/kg, methimazole/water (mmi/w), methimazole/quercetin 10 mg/kg (mmi/q10), and methimazole/quercetin 25 mg/kg (mmi/q25). on the 30th day, hormonal dosing was performed to confirm hypothyroidism, and the animals were subsequently treated with 10 or 25 mg/kg quercetin for 60 days. ntpdase activity was not altered in the mmi/w group. however, treatment with quercetin decreased atp and adp hydrolysis in the mmi/q10 and mmi/q25 groups. 5'-nucleotidase activity increased in the mmi/w group, but treatments with 10 or 25 mg/kg quercetin decreased 5'-nucleotidase activity. ada activity decreased in the ct/25 and mmi/q25 groups. furthermore, ache activity was reduced in all groups with hypothyroidism. in vitro tests also demonstrated that quercetin per se decreased ntpdase, 5'-nucleotidase, and ache activities. this study demonstrated changes in the 5'-nucleotidase and ache activities indicating that purinergic and cholinergic neurotransmission are altered in this condition. in addition, quercetin can alter these parameters and may be a promising natural compound with important neuroprotective actions in hypothyroidism.
hypothyroidism	background: autoimmune gastritis (aig) is a gastric pathologic condition affecting the mucosa of the fundus and the body and eventually leading to hypo-achlorhydria.aims: we report our clinical and pathological experience with aig.methods: data from patients with a diagnosis of aig seen in the period january 2002-december 2012 were retrieved. only patients with complete sets of biopsies were analyzed.results: data from 138 patients were available for analysis. pernicious anemia was present in 25% of patients, iron deficiency anemia was found in 29.7% of patients, hypothyroidism in 23% of patients, type 1 diabetes in 7.9% of patients, and vitiligo in 2.8% of patients. parietal cell antibodies were positive in 65% of patients, and no patient had serology positive for celiac disease. all gastric biopsies showed glandular atrophy associated with enterochromaffin-like (ecl)-cells hyperplasia, features limited to the mucosa of the fundus and body, and focal glandular intestinal metaplasia. helicobacter pylori was negative in all cases.conclusions: aig was strongly associated with anemia; atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and ecl hyperplasia in the gastric fundus and body are hallmarks of this condition.
hypothyroidism	the aim was to assess the proportion of women requiring a referral to an endocrinologist when carrying out routine screening for maternal thyroid disease simultaneously with screening for down syndrome. between november 2009 and september 2015, women having a first trimester combined test were screened; those symptomatic or being investigated for thyroid problems were excluded. in the first half of the period the blood sample was tested for anti-thyroid peroxidase (tpo) antibodies, serum thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh), and free thyroxine (ft4); thereafter ft4 was not used. women with at least one analyte outside the range (tpo more than 5.6 ku/l, tsh 0.35-4.94 mu/l, ft4 9.0-19.1 pml/l) were referred to an endocrinologist for counseling. of 10,052 women screened, 1190 (11.8%) had tsh, ft4, or antibody levels outside the range; 13.0% when ft4 was used and 10.4% thereafter. most of these positive results were due to a single abnormal marker. there was a much higher positive rate in multiple pregnancies (27.3% compared with 11.5% in singletons; p < 0.0001). there was an association between positivity and maternal age (p < 0.0001), a higher rate in the small ethnic group of asians (p < 0.0005) and a lower rate among smokers (p < 0.02) and following assisted reproduction (p < 0.05). routine antibody and hormone testing at the same time as the combined test generated a large number of referrals but this did not overload the services.
hypothyroidism	accumulating evidences showed that thyroid hormone was participated in the functioning of the reproductive system, and an elevated level of thyroid hormones had a negative impact on reproductive system. however, the molecular basis for this observation still remains to be fully understood. here, we show that l-thyroxine significantly impaired human sperm motility. the molecular basis showed that thyroxine receptor stimulation triggers phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt signaling activation leading to the e3 ligase mdm2 phosphorylation at serine 166, which directly interacted with p53 for degradation. p53 degradation caused a p53-dependent dna damage checkpoint or repair dysfunction, which eventually results in dna damage accumulation in sperm. our results highlight that inhibition of pi3k/akt pathway or p53 degradation is important in maintaining sperm motility in a thyroxine receptor (tr)-dependent manner.

hypothyroidism	background: thyroid hormone concentrations may deviate from normal values during critical illness. this condition is known as nonthyroidal illness syndrome (ntis), and it can influence the results of screening for congenital hypothyroidism (ch) during neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo). objectives: to determine the incidence of aberrant ch screening results in ecmo-treated neonates, to identify possible determinants, and to follow up patients with abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations. methods: in this retrospective cohort study, we included 168 ecmo-treated neonates admitted from 2004 to 2014 and screened by protocol and divided them into the following 3 groups: group 1 (screened during ecmo, n = 107), group 2 (screened shortly before ecmo, n = 26), and group 3 (screened shortly after ecmo, n = 35). results: ch screening results were aberrant in 67.3% (72/107) of the neonates screened during ecmo, in 73.1% (19/26) of the neonates screened before ecmo, and in 31.4% (11/35) of the neonates screened after ecmo (p < 0.001). of the neonates with an aberrant screening result, all but 2 (i.e. 98%) had a low thyroxine concentration with a normal thyrotropin concentration at screening, as is seen in ntis. none was diagnosed with ch. mortality did not significantly differ between neonates with an aberrant screening result (32.4%) and neonates with a normal screening result (22.7%; p = 0.18). screening before ecmo (or 5.92; 95% c11.93-18.20), screening during ecmo (or 4.49; 95% ci 1.98-10.19), and a higher pediatric logistic organ dysfunction-2 score (or 1.31; 95% ci 1.04-1.66) were associated with an aberrant screening result. conclusions: aberrant ch screening results were found in most ecmo-treated neonates screened before or during ecmo, which is likely due to ntis. follow-up of thyroid hormone concentrations is best started after recovery from critical illness. our results suggest that thyroxine therapy is not required during ecmo.

headache	daclatasvir (dcv) is a potent, pangenotypic, hepatitis c virus (hcv) non-structural protein 5a inhibitor with low potential for drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy (art). we evaluated the safety and efficacy of dcv plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin (pegifn/rbv) in hiv-1/hcv genotype-1-coinfected patients. ai444043 (nct01471574), an open-label, phase iii, single-arm, response-guided treatment (rgt) study included 301 patients. they received dcv doses of 30, 60 or 90 mg once daily (depending on concomitant art), plus weight-based rbv (< 75 kg, 1000 mg/day; or ae75 kg, 1200 mg/day), and once-weekly pegifn 180 mu g, for 24 weeks. if required by rgt, pegifn/rbv without dcv was extended for an additional 24 weeks of therapy. the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (svr12). overall, 224 (74%) patients achieved svr12 and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was higher than the historic svr rate with pegifn/rbv alone (70 vs. 29%). most common adverse events (aes) were fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, asthenia and headache. on-treatment serious aes occurred in 24/301 (8%) patients; 18/301 (6%) discontinued treatment due to ae. dcv + pegifn/rbv led to sustained hcv virologic response in the majority of hiv-1-hcv-coinfected patients, regardless of concomitant art. hiv control was not compromised and no new safety signals were identified. this study supports dcv use in hiv-1-hcv-coinfected patients, while allowing the vast majority of patients to remain on their existing art regimen.
headache	background: vestibular rehabilitation is the most effective treatment for dizziness due to vestibular dysfunction. given the biological relationship between vestibular symptoms and headache, headache in patients with vestibular migraine (vm) could be improved by vestibular rehabilitation that leads to the improvement of dizziness. this study aimed to compare the effects of vestibular rehabilitation on headache and other outcomes relating to dizziness, and the psychological factors in patients with vm patients, patients with dizziness and tension-type headache, and patients without headache. methods: our participants included 251 patients with dizziness comprising 28 patients with vm, 79 patients with tension-type headache, and 144 patients without headache. participants were hospitalized for 5 days and taught to conduct a vestibular rehabilitation program. they were assessed using the dizziness handicap inventory (dhi), headache impact test (hit-6), hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), and somatosensory catastrophizing scale (sscs) and underwent center of gravity fluctuation measurement as an objective dizziness severity index before, 1 month after, and 4 months after their hospitalization. results: the vm and tension-type headache groups demonstrated a significant improvement in the hit-6 score with improvement of the dhi, hads, sscs, and a part of the objective dizziness index that also shown in patients without headache following vestibular rehabilitation. the change in hit-6 during rehabilitation in the vm group was positively correlated with changes in the dhi and anxiety in the hads. changes in the hit-6 in tension-type headache group positively correlated with changes in anxiety and sscs. conclusion: vestibular rehabilitation contributed to improvement of headache both in patients with vm and patients with dizziness and tension-type headache, in addition to improvement of dizziness and psychological factors. improvement in dizziness following vestibular rehabilitation could be associated with the improvement of headache more prominently in vm compared with comorbid tension-type headache.
headache	background: benign episodic unilateral mydriasis is one cause of anisocoria. this phenomenon is thought to be related to an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. there is a documented association with migraines, but asymptomatic cases have also been reported. a challenge with all cases is the level of investigation required to exclude more sinister causes of nervous system dysfunction. in a dynamic flight environment, additional considerations need to be made, such as varying light levels and use of night vision devices. case report: a 27-yr-old woman on deployment to afghanistan as a flight nurse presented to the role one clinic with right-sided mydriasis.the patient denied headache or any history of migraines. a dilated right pupil that was reactive to light was found on exam. symptoms and exam findings resolved shortly after initial presentation. we consulted an ophthalmologist who requested patient transfer for review. he made a diagnosis of benign episodic unilateral mydriasis. discussion: there are a variety of causes for anisocoria. a thorough history and examination are required to avoid unnecessary investigations that may not be locally available in the more austere deployed military settings. from an operational perspective, the decision needs to be made regarding the maintenance of flight status. consideration needs to be given to patient care capability when treating a flight nurse. in cases of rapid resolution such as this, removal from operational status is not reasonable should a clinician be confident of the diagnosis.
headache	anterior inferior cerebellar artery (aica) aneurysms are extremely rare, accounting for only 0.75% of all intracranial aneurysms. the average age of patients suffering from those aneurysms found in the literature was 44 years, with no significant difference between the sexes. these aneurysms can manifest clinically through expansive symptoms in cerebellopontine angle or through signs and symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, nystagmus and paresis. the gold standard exam for diagnosis is cerebral angiography. the treatment of these lesions is controversial. the main difficulty of the surgical treatment of these aneurysms is the location of the aica, which lies close to critical neurovascular structures. in this article, we describe a proximal aica aneurysm embolization without occlusion of the parent artery, with excellent results in the postoperative period.
headache	objectiveto determine whether baseline nausea or prior triptan treatment for migraine impact the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in treating acute migraine. backgrounda great deal of variability exists in patients' response to migraine medications. migraine-associated nausea is common and debilitating and can reduce the effectiveness of oral medications. it may cause patients to delay taking oral medications, which is known to diminish therapeutic outcomes, or to avoid taking them altogether. gastroparesis, which may be associated with nausea, also inhibits drug absorption, resulting in lower bioavailability. studies have shown that having nausea at the time of drug administration predicts a poorer response to triptan treatment. it is of interest to understand how effective other migraine medications are in patients with a poor response to triptans. methodsdata from two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials were pooled and post hoc subgroup analyses were performed in patients with and without nausea at baseline, and in patients with and without prior triptan treatment. efficacy assessments included the percentage of patients who, at 2 hours postdosing, were headache pain-free (2hpf, primary endpoint), without photophobia, without phonophobia, without nausea, or without a severe degree of disability. a cochran-mantel-haenszel test, stratified by analysis center was used to evaluate treatment effect. effects of nausea or prior triptan use were determined using logistic regression with factors of treatment group, analysis center, nausea or prior triptan use at time of dosing, and interaction of treatment group by nausea or prior triptan use at time of dosing. resultsthe modified intent to treat population consisted of 1272 patients, 644 on active drug and 628 on placebo. the majority of patients (85%) were female. at the time of dosing, 783 (62%) patients reported nausea with the treated attack. prior triptan use was recorded in 570 (45%). for headache pain, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, patients in the active treatment group had a statistically significantly better response than those receiving placebo, regardless of whether they had nausea at baseline. in logistic regression analysis only treatment group predicted a response for these parameters with no detectable group interaction. baseline nausea, as well as treatment group, predicted whether patients recorded severe disability at 2 hours. while patients in the active treatment group were significantly more likely to be headache pain-free at 2 hours after dosing, whether or not they had previously been treated with triptan, more triptan-naive patients (30%) than triptan-experienced patients (20%) were headache pain-free. interestingly, in the placebo groups, triptan-naive patients were also more likely to be pf (14% vs 7%). in the logistic regression analysis, treatment group predicted a headache pain response, triptan use predicted a lack of response, and there was no interaction between the two. prior triptan use did not predict any of the other outcome measures. conclusionsnausea at the time of dosing does not diminish the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium for oral solution. the rapid absorption profile may enhance the effectiveness in patients with nausea. prior triptan use predicted poorer headache response at 2 hours postdose, suggesting the possibility of a subset of patients who are more likely to be refractory to both triptans and diclofenac. diclofenac potassium for oral solution is effective in triptan-naive patients but no reliable inference can be made from this study as to about how to order treatment.
overactive_bladder	this study was conducted in order to determine the effect of the presence of urinary incontinence on sexual quality of life in women diagnosed with chronic physical diseases. the sample of the cross sectional and comparative study consisted of 67.5 % (n = 191) female inpatients with and 32.5 % (n = 92) female inpatients without urinary incontinence complaints being treated for chronic physical diseases in the internal diseases clinic of a public hospital. data was collected using the patient identification form, the international incontinence consultation questionnaire-short form and the sexual quality of life scale for women. the average score that women with urinary incontinence took from the sexual quality of life scale (61.50 +/- 19.10) was lower than the average score of women without urinary incontinence (77.19 +/- 18.75) (p < 0.01). there was a negative meaningful relationship between the frequency, amount, and effect of urinary incontinence and sexual quality of life (p < 0.05). the sexual quality of life of women who were 50 years of age and above, who had respiratory system diseases, had a duration of illness between 6 and 10 years, perceived their general health as bad, parity and gave normal birth, were in their menopausal period, and had hysterectomies was significantly lower (p < 0.05). as a result, in women with chronic physical diseases and urinary incontinence, the sexual quality of life is affected in a worse level compared to those who do not have urinary incontinence.
overactive_bladder	background: treatment of urgency urinary incontinence has focused on pharmacologically treating detrusor overactivity. recent recognition that altered perception of internal stimuli (interoception) plays a role in urgency urinary incontinence suggests that exploration of abnormalities of brain function in this disorder could lead to better understanding of urgency incontinence and its treatment. objective: we sought to: (1) evaluate the relationship between bladder filling, perceived urgency, and activation at brain sites within the interoceptive network in urgency urinary incontinence; (2) identify coactivation of other brain networks that could affect interoception during bladder filling in urgency incontinence; and (3) demonstrate interaction between these sites prior to bladder filling by evaluating their resting-state connectivity. study design: we performed an observational cohort study using functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain function in 53 women with urgency urinary incontinence and 20 controls. whole-brain voxelwise analyses of covariance were performed to examine differences in functional brain activation between groups during a task consisting of bladder filling, hold (static volume), and withdrawal phases. the task was performed at 3 previously established levels of baseline bladder volume, the highest exceeding strong desire to void volume. all women continuously rated their urge on a 0- to 10-point likert scale throughout the task and a mixed measures analysis of variance was used to test for differences in urge ratings. empirically derived regions of interest from analysis of activation during the task were used as seeds for examining group differences in resting-state functional connectivity. results: in both urgency urinary incontinent participants and controls, changes in urge ratings were greatest during bladder filling initiated from a high baseline bladder volume and urgency incontinent participants' rating changes were greater than controls. during this bladder-filling phase urgency incontinent participant 's activation of the interoceptive network was greater than controls, including in the left insula and the anterior and middle cingulate cortex. urgency incontinent participant 's activation was also greater than controls at sites in the ventral attention network and posterior default mode network. urgency incontinent participant 's connectivity was greater than controls between a middle cingulate seed point and the dorsal attention network, a ""top-down"" attentional network. control connectivity was greater between the midcingulate seed point and the ventral attention network, a ""bottom-up"" attentional network. conclusion: increasing urge was associated with greater urgency incontinent participant than control activation of the interoceptive network and activation in networks that are determinants of self-awareness (default mode network) and of response to unexpected external stimuli (ventral attention network). differences in connectivity between interoceptive networks and opposing attentional networks (ventral attention network vs dorsal attention network) were present even before bladder filling (in the resting state). these findings are strong evidence for a central nervous system component of urgency urinary incontinence that could be mediated by brain-directed therapies.
overactive_bladder	purpose: we investigated the efficacy of 2 alpha 1-blockers with different affinities for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes silodosin and naftopidil in the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement complicated by overactive bladder. materials and methods: this was a prospective, open label, randomized, multicenter study of 350 outpatients with untreated benign prostatic enlargement associated with urinary urgency at least once per week and an oabss (overactive bladder symptom score) of 3 or greater. patients were randomly assigned to receive silodosin 8 mg per day or naftopidil 75 mg per day. changes in parameters from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks were assessed based on i-pss (international prostate symptom score), i-pss quality of life, oabss and voiding functions measured by uroflowmetry. results: on efficacy analysis a total of 314 patients were included in the 2 groups. no significant difference in adverse effects was observed between the groups. mean i-pss and i-pss quality of life scores, and oabss significantly improved in both groups. statistically significantly greater improvement in the silodosin group than in the naftopidil group was observed in total oabss (p = 0.03), i-pss quality of life score (p = 0.005) and oabss urgency score (pa-adrenoceptor blocker.
overactive_bladder	aimcentral efferent and afferent neural pathways to and from the human urinary bladder are well-characterized, but the location and arborization of these nerves as they traverse the serosa, muscularis, and urothelial layers are not clearly defined. the purpose of this study was to create a three dimensional map of the innervation of the human bladder trigone from the extrinsic perivesical adventitial nerve trunks to the urothelium. methodsa male and a female human bladder were harvested from fresh frozen cadavers and fixed in formalin. the bladder neck and trigone region were serially sectioned (5m) and every 20th slide was stained (s100), scanned and aligned to create 3d maps. resultsnerve penetration into the detrusor muscle occurs with the highest frequency at the bladder neck and interureteric ridge. nerves traveling parallel to the bladder lumen do so in the adventitia, beyond the outer border of detrusor. in females, the depth of these nerve bands is uniform at 0.7-1.7cm below the luminal surface, the outer limits of which include the anterior vaginal wall. in the male, depth is more variable owing to detrusor hypertrophy with the minimum depth of nerves approximately 0.5cm near the interureteric ridge and over 1cm near the bladder neck. conclusionsmyelinated neural pathways traversing in the human bladder in the region of the trigone have a discreet regional density. this 3d map of trigonal innervation may provide guidance to more precisely direct therapies for urinary incontinence or pelvic pain. neurourol. urodynam. 36:1015-1019, 2017.

overactive_bladder	purpose: to evaluate the relationship between prostatic vessel changes induced by cigarette smoking and the perioperative outcome of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (holep). materials and methods: a total of 268 postoperative patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) were prospectively analysed in our department. they were divided into two groups (smokers and non-smokers) according to smoking history. transrectal colour doppler ultrasound was performed to evaluate the prostate vascular changes. pathologically, he staining, cd31 and cd34 were analysed in prostatic section chips. furthermore, postoperative outcomes were determined during a 6-month follow-up period. results: the preoperative prostate volume was significantly decreased in smoking patients (p = 0.04). cpi was significantly lower in smoking bph patients (p < 0.01), whereas ri was significantly increased in smokers compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.01). histological assays revealed elevated cd34 in the smoking bph individuals presenting an increased number of microvessels. the holep duration was increased in smokers. interestingly, we identified significantly increased overactive bladder syndrome score (oabss) and decreased qmax in smoking individuals during the 6-month follow-up with no difference being observed preoperatively. however, no significant difference between the groups was observed for the international prostate symptom score (ipss). conclusions: the significantly lower cpi and higher ri values in smoking bph patients indicated the presence of considerable vascular damage in these subjects. moreover, cigarette smoking extended the surgical duration and prolonged the recovery period of overactive bladder (oab) syndrome. thus, integrated treatment should be suggested for various bph individuals.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	use of probiotic therapy is an active area of investigation to treat intestinal disorders. the clinical benefits of the i3.1 probiotic formula (lactobacillus plantarum (cect7484, cect7485) and p. acidilactici (cect7483)) were demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. the aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of i3.1 in two experimental models of colitis, a dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis model and an interleukin (il)-10-deficient mice model. colitis was induced in 32 8-week-old balb/c mice by administering 3% (w/v) dss in drinking water for 5 days. probiotics were administered orally (i3.1 or vsl#3, 1 x 109 cfu daily) for 10 days before the administration of dss. also, probiotics (i3.1 or vsl# 3, 1 x 109 cfu daily) were administered orally to 36 6-week-old c57b6j il-10(-/-) mice for 10 weeks. body weight was recorded daily. colon samples were harvested for histological examination and cytokine measurements. body weight after dss administration did not change in the i3.1 group, whereas the vsl#3 group had weight loss. also, i3.1 normalized il-6 to levels similar to that of healthy controls and significantly increased the reparative histologic score. in the il-10-deficient model, both vsl# 3 and i3.1 reduced the severity of colitis compared to untreated controls, and i3.1 significantly reduced the levels of ifn-gamma compared to the other two groups. in conclusion, i3.1 displays a protective effect on two murine models of experimental colitis. results suggest that the mechanism of action could be different from vsl#3.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	microscopic colitis is a generic term that includes 2 main forms, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, and describes a form of inflammatory bowel disease with a chronic and relapsing course. the incidence of microscopic colitis is between 2 and 8 times higher in women than in men, although age, more than sex, increases the risk of collagenous colitis (odds ratio [or] 8.3 for age >= 65 vs. <65 and or 2.8 for women). the main symptom is chronic non bloody watery diarrhoea. other common symptoms include abdominal pain (50%-70%), with the result that many patients with microscopic colitis meet criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. colonoscopy with multiple colonic biopsies is currently recommended, as histological changes are the main characteristic feature. the colonic mucosa is macroscopically normal, although certain minimal endoscopic abnormalities have been described.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	objectives: to compare cumulative ionizing radiation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) for the years 2001-2011. to study how radiation exposure change over time in patients with newly diagnosed ibd and factors associated with radiation exposure. material and methods: all radiological investigations performed between 1 january 2001 and 31 december 2011 were retrospectively recorded in patients with crohn 's disease (cd) (n=103), ulcerative colitis (uc) (n=304) and ibs (n=149). analyses were done with mann-whitney and chi-square test. results: the median total cumulative radiation exposure in msv for cd (20.0, inter quartile range (iqr) 34.8), uc (7.01, iqr 23.8), ibs (2.71, iqr 9.15) and the proportion of patients who had been exposed for more than 50 msv during the study period (cd 19%, uc 11%, ibs 3%) were significantly higher in the patients with cd compared to patients with uc (p<.001) and ibs (p<.001), respectively. in turn, patients with uc had significantly higher doses than patients with ibs (p=.005). risk factors for radiation exposure were female gender (cd), early onset (uc), ileocolonic location (cd), previous surgery (cd and uc), depression (ibs) and widespread pain (ibs). in newly diagnosed cd, there was a significant decline in median cumulative radiation dose in msv (17.2 vs. 12.0; p=.048) during the study period. conclusions: patients with cd are at greatest risk for high cumulative radiation exposure, but there is a decline in exposure during the late 2000s. non-colectomized patients with uc and patients with ibs have a relatively low risk of cumulative radiation exposure.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (asia) is an entity that includes different autoimmune conditions observed after exposure to an adjuvant. patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (uctd) present many signs and symptoms of asia, alluding to the idea that an exposure to adjuvants can be a trigger also for uctd. the aim of this case-control study was to investigate exposure to adjuvants prior to disease onset in patients affected by uctd. ninety-two uctd patients and 92 age- and sex-matched controls with no malignancy, chronic infections, autoimmune disease nor family history of autoimmune diseases were investigated for exposure to adjuvants. an ad hoc-created questionnaire exploring the exposure to vaccinations, foreign materials and environmental and occupational exposures was administered to both cases and controls. autoantibodies were also analyzed (anti-nuclear, anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-double-stranded dna, anti-cardiolipin, anti-beta 2 glycoprotein i). uctd patients displayed a greater exposure to hbv (p = 0.018) and tetanus toxoid (p < 0.001) vaccinations, metal implants (p < 0.001), cigarette smoking (p = 0.006) and pollution due to metallurgic factories and foundries (p = 0.048) as compared to controls. uctd patients exposed to major asia triggers (vaccinations, silicone implants) (n = 49) presented more frequently with chronic fatigue (p < 0.001), general weakness (p = 0.011), irritable bowel syndrome (p = 0.033) and a family history for autoimmunity (p = 0.018) in comparison to non-exposed uctds. asia and uctd can be considered as related entities in the ""mosaic of autoimmunity"": the genetic predisposition and the environmental exposure to adjuvants elicit a common clinical phenotype characterized by signs and symptoms of systemic autoimmunity.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objectives: the aim of the study was to systemically investigate the risk of subsequent irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) in children with antecedent allergic diseases in a population-based case-control study in taiwan. methods: we evaluated 11,242 children (age range: 7-18 years) with ibs and 44,968 age- and sex-matched control subjects who had been examined between 2000 and 2008. ibs odds ratios were calculated for children with antecedent allergic diseases, including allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and food allergy. results: children with antecedent allergic diseases had a greater risk of ibs than did control subjects (p < 0.001). among the 6 evaluated diseases, the highest adjusted odds ratio of 1.78 was observed with allergic rhinitis (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.69-1.87). with 2 or more allergic diseases, the adjusted odds ratios increased to 2.06 (95% ci, 1.93-2.19) for all subjects, 2.07 (95% ci, 1.88-2.28) for girls, and 2.18 (95% ci, 2.02-2.35) for children 12 years or older. conclusions: preschoolers with a history of allergic disease had an increased risk of subsequent ibs development upon reaching school age. this risk increased in the presence of concurrent allergic disease and a higher clinical allergy burden.
polycythemia_vera	red blood cells play a key role in normal hemostasis and thrombosis. their ability to affect coagulation is multifactorial and depends on their mechanical properties affecting viscosity and blood flow, ability to aggregate and adhere to each other and potentially to vascular endothelium, molecular signaling via microvesicles and surface proteins, including blood group antigens, and participation in nitric oxide metabolism. transfused red blood cells suffer from a storage lesion that damages the cells leading to changes in shape, function, and intracellular communication. in this article, we review if and how transfused red blood cells may lead to both increased hemorrhage and increased thrombosis.
polycythemia_vera	purpose of review venous thromboembolism is frequent in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn). the current strategy for its management includes cytoreductive therapy and antithrombotic prophylaxis, but many issues remain uncertain. in this review, the risk factors and prevention of recurrences will be discussed. recent findings around one-third of patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia experience a major thrombosis at diagnosis or during follow-up. according to the european leukemia net guidelines, these patients must be included in the high-risk group for thrombotic recurrence and should be treated with cytoreduction and antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs in the presence of arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. despite this treatment, the annual incidence of recurrence after the first venous thrombosis varies from 4.2 to 6.5% on vitamin k-antagonists and is doubled after discontinuation. the highest incidence of recurrence occurs after cerebral and hepatic vein thrombosis (8.8 and 8 per 100 pt-years, respectively). the occurrence of major bleeding on vitamin k-antagonists is similar to a non-mpn population and accounts for a rate of 1.8-2.4 per 100 pt-years. summary after venous thrombosis, the incidence of recurrence in mpn remains elevated, which suggested there was a need to review the current recommendations of primary and secondary prophylaxis.
polycythemia_vera	objective: in an era of controversy in regard to 'hydroxyurea-leukaemogenicity' and when interferon-alfa2 (ifn) is being revived in the treatment of philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns), we aim in this single-centre observational study to describe the frequencies of second malignancies in a cohort of mpn patients treated with hydroxyurea (hu) or ifn monotherapy or the combination of these agents. patients and methods: records of a mpn cohort of 196 patients were reviewed, and a retrospective analysis was performed on 90 patients treated with hu, 38 patients treated with ifn and 68 patients treated with both ifn and hu. logistic regression was used to compare frequencies in second malignancies. results: patients treated with hu had a significantly higher risk of developing all second malignancies compared with patients treated with ifn [hu vs. ifn: or of 4.01 (95% ci: 1.12-14.27, pvalue: 0.023) and hu-ifn vs. ifn: or 5.58 (95% ci: 1.55-20.15, p-value: 0.004)]. conclusion: we have found an increased risk of second malignancies in mpn patients treated with hu compared with patients treated with ifn.
polycythemia_vera	chromosomal abnormalities at 14q11, which encodes the t-cell receptor alpha and delta chain genes, are generally specific for t-cell malignancies, and are rarely reported in other malignancies. we report a novel t(11;14)(p13;q11.2) in a patient with myelofibrosis (mf) following polycythemia vera (pv). this 55-year-old male developed post-pv mf 12 years after the initial diagnosis of pv. he had a normal karyotype at polycythemic disease stage, t(11;14)(p13;q11.2) was newly detected at the time of fibrotic transformation. therefore, it is likely that this clonal chromosomal abnormality was associated with progression of disease.
polycythemia_vera	besides genetic abnormalities in mpn patients, several studies have reported alterations in protein expression that could contribute towards the clinical phenotype. however, little is known about protein modifications in ph- mpn erythrocytes. in this context, we used a quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics approach to study the mpn erythrocyte proteome. lc-ms/ms (ltq orbitrap) analysis led to the identification of 51 and 86 overexpressed proteins in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia respectively, compared with controls. functional comparison using pathway analysis software showed that the rho gtpase family signaling pathways were deregulated in mpn patients. in particular, iqgap1 was significantly overexpressed in mpns compared with controls. additionally, western-blot analysis not only confirmed iqgap1 overexpression, but also showed that iqgap1 levels depended on the patient 's genotype. moreover, we found that in jak2v617f patients iqgap1 could bind rhoa, rac1 and cdc42 and consequently recruit activated gtp-rac1 and the cytoskeleton motility protein pak1. in calr( +) patients, iqgap1 was not overexpressed but immunoprecipitated with rhogdi. in jak2v617f transduced ba/f3 cells we confirmed jak2 inhibitor-sensitive overexpression of iqgap1/pak1. altogether, our data demonstrated alterations of iqgap1/rho gtpase signaling in mpn erythrocytes dependent on jaic2/calr status, reinforcing the hypothesis that modifications in erythrocyte signaling pathways participate in ph- mpn pathogenesis.

atrial_fibrillation	background-the activation pattern of localized reentry (lr) in atrial tachycardia remains incompletely understood. we used the ultra-high density rhythmia mapping system to study activation patterns in lr. methods and results-lr was suggested by small rotatory activations (carousels) containing the full spectrum of the colorcoded map. twenty-three left-sided atrial tachycardias were mapped in 15 patients (age: 64 +/- 11 years). 16 253 +/- 9192 points were displayed per map, collected over 26 +/- 14 minutes. a total of 50 carousels were identified (median 2; quartiles 1-3 per map), although this represented lr in only n=7 out of 50 (14%): here, rotation occurred around a small area of scar (< 0.03 mv; 12 +/- 6 mm diameter). in lr, electrograms along the carousel encompassed the full tachycardia cycle length, and surrounding activation moved away from the carousel in all directions. ablating fractionated electrograms (117 +/- 18 ms; 44 +/- 13% of tachycardia cycle length) within the carousel interrupted the tachycardia in every lr case. all remaining carousels were pseudo-reentrant (n=43/50 [86%]) occurring in areas of wavefront collision (n=21; median 0.5; quartiles 0-2 per map) or as artifact because of annotation of noise or interpolation in areas of incomplete mapping (n=22; median 1, quartiles 0-2 per map). pseudo-reentrant carousels were incorrectly ablated in 5 cases having been misinterpreted as lr. conclusions-the activation pattern of lr is of small stable rotational activations (carousels), and this drove 30% (7/23) of our postablation atrial tachycardias. however, this appearance is most often pseudo-reentrant and must be differentiated by interpretation of electrograms in the candidate circuit and activation in the wider surrounding region.
atrial_fibrillation	background: we evaluated the outcomes of totally endoscopic minimally invasive surgery for atrial septal defect (asd) using a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch in the transcatheter interventional era. methods and results: we retrospectively reviewed 37 consecutive patients who underwent totally endoscopic asd closure with a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch between june 2011 and april 2015. all patients had been deferred from catheter-based intervention for clinical or anatomical reasons. we analyzed operative outcomes and postoperative echocardiographic data. the mean age was 45.7 16.5 years, and 25 patients (67.6%) were women. the mean ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow was 2.4 0.7. six patients (16.2%) underwent concomitant tricuspid valve repair, and 3 patients (8.1%) underwent concomitant atrial fibrillation surgery. there were no operative deaths, and the median length of hospital stay was 5 days. postoperative echocardiography revealed trivial residual shunt in 1 patient. during the follow-up period, there were no re-interventions for asd or readmission for heart failure. follow-up echocardiography revealed no recurrent shunt or calcification of the autologous pericardial patch. conclusions: totally endoscopic asd closure with a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch demonstrated excellent outcomes. it is a useful option for patients with unfavorable anatomy or other reasons excluding transcatheter intervention.
atrial_fibrillation	in clinical practice, low-molecular-weight heparins are used relatively frequently in patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent embolic events. in this article, it is revised the available evidence in the following clinical situations: rapid onset of anticoagulation, bridging therapy (replacing long-term oral anticoagulant therapy around an invasive procedure) and transesophageal echocardiography-guided cardioversion.

atrial_fibrillation	introduction: atrial fibrillation (af) is a cardiac arrhythmia caused by various mechanisms, such as multiple reentering wavelets, high frequency activity, and rotor sources. evidence acquisition: this narrative review was based on papers found on pubmed and medline up to may 2016. the search terms were ""atrial fibrillation"" in combination with ""catheter ablation, pathophysiology, antiarrhythmic drugs"". evidence synthesis: antiarrhythmic drugs are the cornerstone of therapy in af, but their efficacy and safety might have to be improved. in case of failure of pharmacologic therapies, other treatments can be considered. a better understanding of the important role of the pulmonary veins has led to new approaches, such as ablation procedures, which were initially only surgical, while percutaneous options were later added. however, these strategies may present various technical complications also when performed by skilled operators. a promising field of investigation is the genetics of af, as highlighted by studies on the role of micro-rna. conclusions: relevant improvement on the knowledge of the electrophysiological basis of genesis and maintenance of af has been done in order to treat a very common arrhythmia, but further studies, as those in the genetics field, can open new challenging therapeutic horizons.
atrial_fibrillation	background: we hypothesized that survival in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (crt-d) patients is predicted by baseline heart rate score. methods: heart rate score is determined from the atrial paced and sensed histogram of a ddd icd or crt-d, and defined as percent of beats in the histogram in the tallest 10 beats/min range bin. it was calculated at initial remote monitoring for patients enrolled in latitude (r) without persistent atrial fibrillation, and with pulse generators implanted in 2006-2011. univariate, multivariate, and kaplan-meier analyses determined the impact of heart rate score on survival. results: of 57,893 icds and 67,929 crt-ds followed for 2.4 +/- 1.5 years, each 10% increase in heart rate score was associated with decreased survival (crt-d hazard ratio [hr] 1.07 95%, confidence interval 1.06-1.07, p < 0.0001; icd hr 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.06, p70%. conclusion: a simple device histogram measure, heart rate score, predicts survival in icd and crtd patients independent of the available variables, and even when sdann is unavailable.
smoking_cessation	objectives: people living with a psychotic illness have higher rates of cigarette smoking and face unique barriers to quitting compared to the general population. we examined whether self-reported reasons for smoking are useful predictors of successful quit attempts among people with psychosis. methods: as part of a randomized controlled trial addressing smoking and cardiovascular disease risk behaviors among people with psychosis, self-reported reasons for smoking were assessed at baseline (n = 235), 15 weeks (n = 151), and 12 months (n = 139). three factors from the reasons for smoking questionnaire (coping, physiological, and stimulation/activation) were entered into a model to predict short-and long-term abstinence. the relationship between these factors and mental health symptoms were also assessed. results: participants scoring higher on the stimulation/activation factor (control of weight, enjoyment, concentration, and ""peps me up"") at baseline were just less than half as likely to be abstinent at 15 weeks. female participants were five times more likely to abstinent at 15 weeks, and those with a higher global functioning at baseline were 5% more likely to be abstinent. there was a positive correlation between changes over time in the stimulation/activation factor from baseline to 12-month follow-up and the brief psychiatric rating scale total score at 12-month follow-up. this indicates that increasingly higher endorsement of the factor was associated with more psychological symptoms. there was also a negative correlation between the change over time in the stimulation/activation factor and global functioning at 12 months, indicating that increasingly higher endorsement of the factor led to lower global assessment of functioning. conclusions: the stimulation/activation factor may be particularly important to assess and address among smokers with psychosis. it is recommended that further research use the reasons for smoking questionnaire among smokers with psychosis as a clinical tool to identify specific quit barriers. further research into why females have higher smoking cessation rates in the short term and relapse prevention interventions seem worthy of further investigation.
smoking_cessation	nicotin replacement therapy (nrt) has been the preferred first option in smoking cessation treatment for many years. nrt reduces both the desire to smoke and the withdrawal symptoms. nicotine gum addiction may rarely develop during nrt. in this study, we present a case who became addicted to nicotine gum for 18 years, was admitted to the smoking cessation polyclinic, and treated with bupropion. the aim of this case study is to highlight that bupropion is also an effective option to treat nicotine gum addiction, a rarely seen occurrence.

smoking_cessation	this study examines the prevalence and tobacco use patterns among adult social assistance beneficiaries and their interest in quitting. the results are based on data collected in a cross-sectional survey conducted among adults in the piotrkowski district. a sample of 3636 social assistance beneficiaries produced a total of 1817 respondents who completed face-to-face questionnaires. overall, 37.1% of the respondents, including 52.8% men and 29.6% women, were current smokers. over one third of the smokers reported their willingness to quit. in the study population, several characteristics were significantly associated with the current daily smoking: male gender, low educational attainment, unemployment or temporary employment, lack of awareness of smoking-associated health risks, use of e-cigarettes, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ets). the intention to quit smoking among the daily smokers was positively correlated with their awareness of smoking-associated health risks, lack of previous quit attempts, and low exposure to ets. smoking prevalence among social assistance recipients tends to be higher than in the general population, but more than half of the smokers are willing to quit. there is an urgency to develop policies tailored to the needs of these disadvantaged population groups.
lymphoma	the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of myristicin (myr; 1-allyl-5-methoxy-3,4-methy-lenedioxybenzene), an active aromatic compound isolated from nutmeg, carrot, basil, cinnamon and parsley, in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in rat dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons. it was observed that myr significantly enhanced cell viability in hypoxia-induced drg neurons in a dose-dependent manner; the optimal concentration of myr was 50 mu m. furthermore, myr reduced the percentage of deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end-labeling-positive neuronal cells and influenced the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene b-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) associated x protein, the apoptosis protease cleaved caspase-3 and the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2, in the hypoxia-induced group. in addition, myr protected against hypoxic injury in drg neurons by inhibiting malondialdehyde and lactate dehydrogenase, however upregulating superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. myr reduced the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ers) markers, including ccaat/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein, glucose-related protein 78 and cleaved caspase-12 in the hypoxia-induced group. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the activity of myr against hypoxia-induced apoptosis in rat drg neurons via inhibition of the ers pathway.
lymphoma	conclusion: the multimodal diagnostic algorithm is a simple diagnostic tool in the pre-operative assessment of submandibular masses that enables one-stage surgical concepts.background: the pre-operative assessment of submandibular masses is of major clinical impact. this study assesses the diagnostic utility of a newly introduced diagnostic algorithm in the differentiation of submandibular masses based on epidemiological and b-mode ultrasonographic data.methods: one hundred and eighty-eight patients with submandibular triangle masses were included. epidemiological and ultrasonographic data of 128 consecutively included patients were assessed and structured in a multimodal algorithm. the diagnostic algorithm was prospectively validated in a further 60 patients.results: single epidemiological and ultrasonographic data do not reliably predict the lesional entity. the multimodal diagnostic algorithm achieved a diagnostic sensitivity/specificity of 100%/100% in sialolithiasis, 44%/100% in benign submandibular gland diseases (bsd), 94%/96% in nodal lymphoma/unspecific lymphadenitis, and 91%/84% in carcinomas. reduced sensitivity in bsd or specificity in carcinomas increased after intra-operative fresh frozen section in patients suspected for bsd.
lymphoma	background: epstein barr virus (ebv) plays a causal role in some diseases, including infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. detection of ebv infection has been shown to be a useful tool for diagnosing ebv-related diseases. in the present study, we compared the performance of molecular tests, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and ebv real-time pcr, to those of serological assays for the detection of ebv infection. methods: thirty-eight patients with infectious mononucleosis (im) were enrolled, of whom 31 were diagnosed with a mild type, and seven were diagnosed with im with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection. twenty healthy controls were involved in the study. the atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood were detected under a microscope and the percentage of positive cells was calculated. ebv dna load in peripheral blood was detected using real-time pcr. the fish assay was developed to detect the ebv genome from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). other diagnosis methods including the heterophil agglutination (ha) test and ebv-vca-igm test, to detect ebv were also compared. spss17.0 was used for statistical analysis. results: in all, 5-41% atypical lymphocytes were found among the pbmc in mild im patients, whereas 8-51% atypical lymphocytes were found in im patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection patients. there was no significant difference in the ratios of atypical lymphoma between patients of the different types. we observed that 71.2% of mild im patients and 85.7% of im patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection patients were positive for ebv-vca-igm. ebv-vca-igm was negative in all healthy control subjects. in addition, 67.1% of mild im patients tested heterophile antibody positive, whereas 71.4% of im patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection tested positive. ebv dna detected using real-time pcr was observed in 89.5% of these im patients. the ebv genome was detected by the fish assay in 97.4% of the im patients. the eb viral loads detected by fish and real-time pcr increased with the severity of im. the ebv genome was detected in almost all the pbmc of im with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection patients. conclusion: molecular tests, including fish and ebv real-time pcr, are more sensitive than serological assays for the detection of ebv infection. the fish assay detecting ebv copies in unfractionated whole blood is preferable and superior to plasma real-time pcr in its reflection of the absolute viral burden circulating in the patients.
lymphoma	autologous t cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (cars) specific for cd19 have demonstrated remarkable efficacy as therapeutics for b cell malignancies. in the present study, we generated flag-tagged cd19-specific car-t cells (cd19-flag) and compared them to their non-tagged counterparts for their effects on solid and hematological cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. for solid tumors, we used hela cervical carcinoma cells engineered to overexpress cd19 (hela-cd19), and for hematological cancer we used raji burkitt 's lymphoma cells, which endogenously express cd19. like non-tagged cd19 car-t cells, cd19-flag car-t cells expanded in culture >100-fold and exhibited potent cytolytic activity against both hela-cd19 and raji cells in vitro. cd19-flag car-t cells also secreted significantly more ifn-gamma and il-2 than the control t cells. in vivo, cd19-flag car-t cells significantly blocked the growth of hela-cd19 solid tumors, increased tumor cleaved caspase-3 levels, and expanded systemically. cd19-flag car-t cells also significantly reduced raji tumor burden and extended mouse survival. these results demonstrate the strong efficacy of flag-tagged cd19 car-t cells in solid and hematological cancer models.
lymphoma	bovine leukemia virus (blv) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, a malignant b cell lymphoma that has spread worldwide and causes serious problems for the cattle industry. the blv proviral load, which represents the blv genome integrated into host genome, is a useful index for estimating disease progression and transmission risk. here, we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with blv proviral load in japanese black cattle. the study examined 93 cattle with a high proviral load and 266 with a low proviral load. three snps showed a significant association with proviral load. one snp was detected in the cntn3 gene on chromosome 22, and two (which were not in linkage disequilibrium) were detected in the bovine major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 23. these results suggest that polymorphisms in the major histocompatibility complex region affect proviral load. this is the first report to detect snps associated with blv proviral load in japanese black cattle using whole genome association study, and understanding host factors may provide important clues for controlling the spread of blv in japanese black cattle.
asthma	airborne respirable dust (ard) (< 5 mu m) in the stable environment is strongly implicated in equine asthma. bedding, forage, ventilation rate, and stable management activities all contribute to ard. this study investigated the relationship between ard in the breathing zone (bz) and the stable zone (sz) in eight american barns (abs) and eight stable complexes with individual stables under four different management regimes. airborne respirable dust was measured in eight replicate stables per regime in abs (n = 32) and eight per regime in single stables (n = 32). regimes were as follows: (1) steamed hay and shavings; (2) dry hay and shavings; (3) haylage and straw; and (4) dry hay and straw. samples were taken in quite periods between 3 pm and 4 pm hours. airborne respirable dust levels were analyzed using split-plot analysis of variance and wilcoxon matched-pairs test (genstat 15) with p <.05 as significant. the lowest ard (< 360 rp/l air) was found for shavings and steamed hay in ab and single stables in both bz and sz. straw and dry hay in abs produced ard of 6,250 (sz), 5,079 rp/l air (bz) which was greater (p <.05) than the 2,901 (sz) and 942 (bz) rp/l air in single stables. straw and haylage produced more ard across both zones in single stables compared with abs. shavings and dry hay = more dust in the bz than in the sz, whereas straw and haylage = higher ard in the sz versus the bz across both stable designs. using dry hay and/or straw cannot be recommended as a suitable management regime for stabled horses.

asthma	background: pollen exposure has acute adverse effects on sensitized individuals. information on the prevalence of respiratory diseases in areas with different pollen concentrations is scanty. aim: we performed an ecologic analysis to assess whether the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in young adults varied across areas with different pollen concentrations in italy. methods: a questionnaire on respiratory diseases was delivered to random samples of 20-44 year-old subjects from six centers in 2005-2010. data on the daily air concentrations of 7 major allergologic pollens (poaceae, urticaceae, oleaceae, cupressaceae, coryloideae, betula and ambrosia) were collected for 2007-2008. center-specific pollen exposure indicators were calculated, including the average number of days per year with pollens above the low or high concentration thresholds defined by the italian association of aerobiology. associations between pollen exposure and disease prevalence, adjusted for potential confounders, were estimated using logistic regression models with center as a random-intercept. results: overall, 8834 subjects (56.8%) filled in the questionnaire. allergic rhinitis was significantly less frequent in the centers with longer periods with high concentrations of at least one (or per 10 days = 0.989, 95%ci: 0.979-0.999) or at least two pollens (or = 0.974, 95%ci: 0.951-0.998); associations with the number of days with at least one (or = 0.988, 95%cl: 0.972-1.004) or at least two (or = 0.985, 95%ci: 0.970-1.001) pollens above the low thresholds were borderline significant. asthma prevalence was not associated with pollen concentrations. conclusions: our study does not support that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma is greater in centers with higher pollen concentrations. it is not clear whether the observed ecologic associations hold at the individual level.

asthma	to achieve a better understanding of mechanisms underlying the anti-asthmatic action of inhaled and systemic glucocorticoids (gcs) and to provide more data regarding the risk of a negative effect of inhaled gcs on cd4(+) t cells, a study was conducted on the effect of ciclesonide and methylprednisolone on cd4+ effector (teff), regulatory (treg) and resting (trest) t cells within respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues in a mouse model of allergic asthma. the study indicated that one, and possibly a key mechanism, underlying the anti-asthmatic action of inhaled and systemic gcs is the prevention of the activation and clonal expansion of cd4+ teff cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes (mlns), which consequently prevents infiltration of the lungs with cd4+ teff cells. the beneficial effects of gcs in asthma treatment were not mediated through increased recruitment of treg cells into the mlns and lungs and/or local generation of treg cells. the results demonstrated that inhaled and systemic gcs induced comparable depletion of normal cd4+ teff, trest and treg cells in the mlns, head and neck lymph nodes and peripheral blood. furthermore, inhaled, but not systemic gc therapy, led to the loss of these cells in the lungs. thus, the study suggests that inhaled gc therapy may not be safer at all than systemic one with respect to the adverse effect on cd4+ t cells present within and outside the respiratory tract. moreover, administration of inhaled gcs can produce negative effects on lung-residing cd4+ t cells.

asthma	background: researchers investigating lung diseases, such as asthma, have questioned whether certain compounds previously reported in exhaled breath condensate (ebc) originate from saliva contamination. moreover, despite its increasing use in omics profiling studies, the constituents of ebc remain largely uncharacterized. the present study aims to define the usefulness of ebc in investigating lung disease by comparing ebc, saliva, and saliva-contaminated ebc using targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry and the potential of metabolite loss from adsorption to ebc sample collection tubes. methods: liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (lc-ms) was used to analyze samples from 133 individuals from three different cohorts. levels of amino acids and eicosanoids, two classes of molecules previously reported in ebc and saliva, were measured using targeted lc-ms. cohort 1 was used to examine contamination of ebc by saliva. samples from cohort 1 consisted of clean ebc, saliva-contaminated ebc, and clean saliva from 13 healthy volunteers; samples were analyzed using untargeted lc-ms. cohort 2 was used to compare eicosanoid levels from matched ebc and saliva collected from 107 asthmatic subjects. samples were analyzed using both targeted and untargeted lc-ms. cohort 3 samples consisted of clean-ebc collected from 13 subjects, including smokers and non-smokers, and were used to independently confirm findings; samples were analyzed using targeted lc-ms, untargeted lc-ms, and proteomics. in addition to human samples, an in-house developed nebulizing system was used to determine the potential for ebc samples to be contaminated by saliva. results: out of the 400 metabolites detected in both ebc and saliva, 77 were specific to ebc; however, ebc samples were concentrated 20-fold to achieve this level of sensitivity. amino acid concentrations ranged from 196 pg/ml - 4 mu g/ml (clean ebc), 1.98 ng/ml - 6 mu g/ml (saliva-contaminated ebc), and 13.84 ng/ml - 1256 mg/ml (saliva). eicosanoid concentration ranges were an order of magnitude lower; 10 pg/ml - 76.5 ng/ml (clean ebc), 10 pg/ml - 898 ng/ml (saliva-contaminated ebc), and 2.54 ng/ml - 272.9 mg/ml (saliva). although the sample size of the replication cohort (cohort 3) did not allow for statistical comparisons, two proteins and 19 eicosanoids were detected in smoker vs. non-smoker clean-ebc. conclusions: we conclude that metabolites are present and detectable in ebc using lc-ms; however, a large starting volume of sample is required.
asthma	backgroundclinical presentation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exacerbated respiratory disease (nerd) is found to be heterogeneous. this study classified phenotypic clusters to determine nerd subtypes. methodswe performed two-step cluster analysis using urticaria, chronic rhinosinusitis (crs), and atopy, in a nerd cohort comprising 302 patients. asthma exacerbation was defined as receiving at least one burst of intravenous steroid treatment and/or at least two bursts of oral steroid use ( 45 mg/3 days) per year. the possession rate of anti-asthmatic medications was estimated during the follow-up period. resultsthere were four subtypes: subtype 1 (nerd with crs/atopy and no urticaria), subtype 2 (nerd with crs and no urticaria/atopy), subtype 3 (nerd without crs/urticaria), and subtype 4 (nerd with urticaria). significant differences were found between the four subtypes in the female proportion, baseline fev1%, serum total ige level, and sputum/peripheral eosinophil count. a higher frequency of asthma exacerbations was noted in subtype 1 compared to subtype 3. the possession rates of medium- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting beta(2)-agonists showed significant differences among the four subtypes. metabolomic analysis showed that the four subtypes of nerd had a higher serum leukotriene e4 (lte4) level than those with aspirin-tolerant asthma. the patients with subtypes 1 and 3 had a higher urine lte4 level than those with subtype 2. conclusionwe found four distinct subtypes with different clinical/biochemical findings and asthma exacerbations in a nerd cohort. these findings suggest that stratified strategies by applying subtype classification may help achieve better outcomes in the management of nerd.
bipolar_disorder	introduction: analgesics are commonly prescribed medications used to alleviate pain of various aetiologies without affecting the patient 's consciousness. they interfere with the transmission of pain signals. a commonly used antiepileptic drug, sodium valproate has been used in various non-epileptic conditions like migraine prophylaxis and in the treatment of bipolar disorder because of the multiple mechanisms by which it acts. docosahexanoic acid (dha), an omega 3 fatty acid, is known to possess analgesic activity. we planned a study to assess the effect of sodium valproate alone and in combination with dha in rat models of pain. aim: to evaluate the analgesic activity of sodium valproate and dha supplementation using various experimental models in albino wistar rats. materials and methods: for analgesic activity, a total of 48 adult wistar albino rats were divided into eight groups of six rats each. group i was control (distil water 1 ml/kg), group ii received intraperitoneal injection of tramadol (10 mg/kg), group iii, iv, v were injected intraperitoneal sodium valproate 100, 200, 400 mg/kg with distil water respectively and group vi, vii, viii were given sodium valproate 100, 200, 400 mg/kg plus dha 300 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) respectively. analgesic activity was assessed using hot plate, tail flick and acetic acid writhing models. results: we found that sodium valproate at higher doses (400 mg/kg) used either alone along with dha (300 mg/kg) showed statistically significant analgesic activity in comparison to control in various experimental models for assessing pain. conclusion: combination of sodium valproate along with dha has shown promising analgesic activity.
bipolar_disorder	the present work aims at investigating how toxoplasma gondii (t. gondii) infection may be linked to n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) dysfunction in schizophrenia and related disorders and puts forward the hypothesis that immune responses against t. gondii may involve nmdars. indeed, the analysis of the protozoan proteome and nmdar subunits for peptide commonalities shows a massive peptide overlap and supports the possibility that anti-t. gondii immune responses raised during active protozoan infection may cross-react with host nmdars, determining disruption of neural circuits and cognitive deficits. in particular, the nmda 2d subunit, which is mainly expressed in parvalbumin-positive interneurons, appears to be a hotspot for potential t. gondii-induced cross-reactive immune attacks.
bipolar_disorder	transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation which uses a weak constant current to alter cortical excitability and activity temporarily. tdcs-induced increases in neuronal excitability and performance improvements have been observed following anodal stimulation of brain regions associated with visual and motor functions, but relatively little research has been conducted with respect to auditory processing. recently, pilot study results indicate that anodal tdcs can increase auditory deviance detection, whereas cathodal tdcs decreases auditory processing, as measured by a brain-based event-related potential (erp), mismatch negativity (mmn). as evidence has shown that tdcs lasting effects may be dependent on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor activity, the current study investigated the use of dextromethorphan (dmo), an nmda antagonist, to assess possible modulation of tdcs 's effects on both mmn and working memory performance. the study, conducted in 12 healthy volunteers, involved four laboratory test sessions within a randomised, placebo and sham-controlled crossover design that compared pre- and post-anodal tdcs over the auditory cortex (2 ma for 20 minutes to excite cortical activity temporarily and locally) and sham stimulation (i.e. device is turned off) during both dmo (50 ml) and placebo administration. anodal tdcs increased mmn amplitudes with placebo administration. significant increases were not seen with sham stimulation or with anodal stimulation during dmo administration. with sham stimulation (i.e. no stimulation), dmo decreased mmn amplitudes. findings from this study contribute to the understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms mediating tdcs sensory and memory improvements.
bipolar_disorder	the aim of this study was to compare the global functioning and cognitive performance in a community sample of young adults with mood disorders versus community controls. this was a cross-sectional study nested in a cohort study with a community sample, data was collected from february 2012 to june 2014; specifically, at a mean of five years after the first phase, all young adults were invited to participate in a re-evaluation. mini international neuropsychiatric interview- plus (mini-plus) was used for the diagnosis of mood disorders. the functional assessment short test (fast) and the montreal cognitive assessment (moca) were used to assess the global functioning, and cognitive performance, respectively. were included 1258 subjects. functional impairment was greater in subjects with bipolar disorder when compared to community controls, and there were no differences between major depressive disorder and community controls. there were no significant differences in cognitive performance between young adults with mood disorders when compared to community controls. functional impairment is a marker for bipolar disorder in young adults; however, gross cognitive impairment assessed by a screening test is not, possibly because cognition is impaired in more advanced stages of the disorder.
bipolar_disorder	background and aim emotional dysregulation (ed) is a frequent feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). it can be observed as a dysregulation profile or a deficient emotional self-regulation (desr) profile. oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (odd/cd) comorbidity is prevalent in adhd and known to be related with ed. the first-line treatment of adhd includes psychostimulants, but their effects on ed are not well studied. this study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of methylphenidate (mph) treatment on ed in adhd + odd/cd cases. methods a total of 118 adhd + odd/cd patients with a mean age of 9.0 1.9 years were treated with mph for 1 year. also, parents of cases were recruited for a parent-training program, which initiated after first month of mph treatment. symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 12th month by turgay diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition-based child and adolescent behavior disorders screening and rating scale-parent form, children depression inventory, child behavior checklist 4-18 years, and parental acceptance and rejection questionnaire-mother form. results emotional dysregulation (desr + dp) was present in 85.6% of cases. conduct disorder was significantly higher in patients with dp, whereas odd was significantly higher in the desr and non-ed groups (p < 0.0001). symptoms of adhd and ed were significantly improved with 1-year of mph treatment (p < 0.05). the improvement in ed was independent of improvement in adhd symptoms and parent training (p < 0.05). conclusions emotional dysregulation is highly prevalent in disruptive behavioral disorders as odd and cd, which are comorbid with adhd. the mph treatment is effective on ed independently from other clinical determinants.
crohn's_disease	background and aim: limited data are available regarding mortality from inflammatory bowel disease in non-caucasian populations. herein, we evaluated overall and cause-specific mortality in a hospital-based cohort of korean inflammatory bowel disease patients. methods: we determined mortality in 2414 crohn 's disease patients and 2798 ulcerative colitis patients diagnosed between 1977 and 2013. standardized mortality ratios were calculated in several demographic and phenotypic subgroups. results: during the mean 9-year follow up, 114 patients died: 35 with crohn 's disease and 79 with ulcerative colitis. the overall standardized mortality ratios were 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.94) in crohn 's disease and 0.73 (0.58-0.91) in ulcerative colitis. in crohn 's disease, female sex, age10years, ileocolonic disease at diagnosis, perianal fistula, intestinal resection, and ever-use of corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality. in ulcerative colitis, male sex, age >= 30years at diagnosis, disease duration <= 5years, proctitis at diagnosis, and no history of colectomy were associated with lower mortality, while primary sclerosing cholangitis was associated with higher mortality. in both crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis, high mortality rates due to nonmalignant gastrointestinal causes (standardized mortality ratios: 4.59 and 2.32, respectively) and gastrointestinal malignancies (standardized mortality ratios: 16.59 and 3.45, respectively) were observed. cardiovascular mortality was lower in ulcerative colitis (standardized mortality ratio: 0.47). conclusions: the overall mortality tended to be higher in crohn 's disease patients than in the general population; it was slightly lower in ulcerative colitis patients than in the general population.
crohn's_disease	bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (bpi) gene polymorphisms have been extensively investigated in terms of their associations with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), with contradictory results. the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate associations between bpi gene polymorphisms and the risk of ibd, crohn 's disease (cd), and ulcerative colitis (uc). eligible studies from pubmed, embase, and cochrane library databases were identified. ten studies (five cd and five uc) published in five papers were included in this meta-analysis. g645a polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of uc in allele model, dominant model, and homozygous model. our data suggested that bpi g645a polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of uc; the bpi g645a polymorphism was not associated with the risk of cd.
crohn's_disease	background: a large body of evidence supports a central role of tlr5 and its natural ligand, flagellin, in crohn 's disease (cd), with the precise mechanism(s) still unresolved. methods: we investigated the role of flagellin/tlr5 in samp1/yitfc (samp) mice, a spontaneous model of crohn 's disease-like ileitis. results: ileal tlr5 and serum antiflagellin igg antibodies were increased in samp before the onset of inflammation and during established disease; these trends were abrogated in the absence of colonizing commensal bacteria. irradiated samp receiving either wild-type (akr) or samp bone marrow (bm) developed severe ileitis and displayed increased ileal tlr5 compared with akr recipients of either samp or akr bone marrow, neither of which conferred ileitis, suggesting that elevated tlr5 in native samp is derived primarily from a nonhematopoietic (e.g., epithelial) source. indeed, ileal epithelial tlr5 in preinflamed samp was increased compared with age-matched akr and germ-free samp. tlr5-specific ex vivo activation of samp ileal tissues decreased epithelial barrier resistance, indicative of increased permeability, and was accompanied by altered expression of the tight junction proteins, claudin-3, occludin, and zonula occludens-1. conclusions: our results provide evidence that aberrant, elevated tlr5 expression is present in the ileal epithelium of samp mice, is augmented in the presence of the gut microbiome, and that tlr5 activation in response to bacterial flagellin results in a deficiency to maintain appropriate epithelial barrier integrity. together, these findings represent a potential mechanistic pathway leading to the exacerbation and perpetuation of chronic gut inflammation in experimental ileitis and possibly, in patients with crohn 's disease.
crohn's_disease	background for many years, 'conventional' double contrast enteroclysis has been suggested as the technique of choice for the evaluation of the small intestine. computed tomography (ct) performed with oral and intravenous contrast material has a proven track record of depicting bowel wall and mesenteric abnormalities. ct enteroclysis was developed to overcome the individual deficiencies of ct and conventional enteroclysis and to combine the advantages of both barium enteroclysis and conventional abdominal ct examinations into one technique. the present study is a longitudinal study to evaluate the role of multi-detector row helical computed tomographic (ct) enteroclysis for the depiction of small bowel diseases in patients. aim of study-to prospectively evaluate the role of multi-detector row helical computed tomographic (mdct) enteroclysis for the depiction of small-bowel diseases. materials and methods study group-ct enteroclysis was done for 35 clinically suspected cases of small-bowel diseases referred to department of radiodiagnosis, yenepoya medical college, mangalore from october 2014 to september 2016. results of the 33 patients who underwent successful ct enteroclysis, positive findings were obtained in 16 patients (48.5%), and negative findings were obtained in 17 patients 51.56%). among the 16 patients, ct enteroclysis allowed the detection of small-bowel masses in 4 patients including 2 adenocarcinoma, 1 gastrointestinal stromal tumour and 1 lymphoma. ct enteroclysis demonstrated metastatic lymph nodes in 2 cases; small-bowel abnormalities in 12 patients including 4 patients with crohn 's disease and 2 patients with small-bowel tuberculosis. images demonstrated site and cause of small bowel obstruction in 2 cases and areas of stenosis in 12 cases with the mural and extramural inflammatory changes. conclusion ct enteroclysis is a fast, well-tolerated, and reliable imaging modality for the depiction of small-bowel diseases. this technique provides adequate small-bowel distension in a majority of patients. in addition, ct enteroclysis allows the detection of extraluminal disease and provides information relative to the entire abdomen that is not obtained with small-bowel follow-through or endoscopy.
crohn's_disease	the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of newly developed silver nanoparticle aqueous suspensions nanoag1 and nanoag2 in the mouse models mimicking ulcerative colitis and crohn 's disease. nanoag1 and nanoag2 were synthesized in aqueous medium with the involvement of tannic acid. to elucidate their anti- inflammatory activity, semi-chronic mouse models of inflammation induced by dextrane sulfate sodium addition to drinking water and intracolonic (i.c.) administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid were used. nanoag1 and nanoag2 (500 mg/dm3, 100 mu l/animal, i.c., once daily) significantly ameliorated colitis in dextrane sulfate sodium- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced mouse models of colonic inflammation, as indicated by reduced macroscopic, ulcer and microscopic scores. the anti-inflammatory effect was dependent on the shape and diameter of silver nanoparticles, as indicated by weaker effect of nanoag1 than nanoag2. in addition, administration of nanoag2, but not nanoag1, modulated colonic microbiota, as indicated by reduced number of escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens, and increased number of lactobacillus sp. summarizing, nanoag1 and nanoag2 after administered i.c. effectively alleviate colitis in experimental models of ulcerative colitis and crohn 's disease in mice. therefore, nanoag1 and nanoag2 administered i.c. have the potential to become valuable agents for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: avian antigen is a common cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (hp). inhalation challenge with pigeon serum and pigeon dropping extract (pde) elicits a hypersensitivity reaction in patients with bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis (brhp), but the antigenic components in these materials have yet to be fully elucidated. method: pigeon serum, pigeon intestine homogenates, and pde were immunoblotted with serum samples from 8 patients with brhp, 2 patients with summer-type hp, 2 patients with humidifier lung, and 3 healthy volunteers. among the protein spots found in both pigeon serum and pde, those that reacted with sera from brhp patients were identified by mass spectrometry. immunoassays using recombinant protein were performed to confirm the antigenicity of the identified protein. cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) stimulated with recombinant protein was also assessed. results: immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide-1 (igll-1) was identified from all spots on 2-de immunoblots of both pigeon serum and pde. the brhp patients exhibited higher levels of serum igg antibody against the recombinant igll-1 (rigll-1) compared to the control subjects, as well as a stronger pbmcs proliferative response to rigll-1. cytokine production by pbmcs from brhp patients after rigll-1 exposure indicated that the protein could induce th1 prone immune responses: an increase in tnf-alpha and an absence of elevated il-10 production. conclusions: pigeon igll-1 was identified as the brhp antigen present in both pigeon serum and pde.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a devastating disease characterized by an unpredictable course. prognostic markers and disease activity markers are needed. the purpose of this single-center retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of lung fluorodeoxyglucose ([f-18]-fdg) uptake assessed by standardized uptake value (suv), metabolic lung volume (mlv) and total lesion glycolysis (tlg) in patients with ipf. methods: we included 27 ipf patients (ipf group) and 15 patients with a gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor without thoracic involvement (control group). we quantified lung suv mean and suv max, mlv and tlg and assessed clinical data, high-resolution ct (hrct) fibrosis and ground-glass score; lung function; gender, age, physiology (gap) stage at inclusion and during follow-up; and survival. results: lung suv mean and suv max were higher in ipf patients than controls (p < 0.00001). for patients with ipf, suv mean, suv max, mlv and tlg were correlated with severity of lung involvement as measured by a decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (dlco) and increased gap score. in a univariate and in a multivariate cox proportional-hazards model, risk of death was increased although not significantly with high suv mean. on univariate analysis, risk of death was significantly associated with high tlg and mlv, which disappeared after adjustment functional variables or gap index. increased mlv and tlg were independent predictors of death or disease progression during the 12 months after pet scan completion (for every 100-point increase in tlg, hazard ratio [hr]: 1.11 (95% ci 1.06; 1.36), p = 0.003; for every 100-point increase in mlv, hr: 1.20 (1.04; 1.19), p = 0.002). on multivariable analysis including tlg or mlv with age, fvc, and dlco or gap index, tlg and mlv remained associated with progression-free survival (hr: 1.1 [1.03; 1.22], p = 0.01; and 1.13 [1.0; 1.2], p = 0.005). conclusion: fdg lung uptake may be a marker of ipf severity and predict progression-free survival for patients with ipf.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a progressive lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation, fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated. the contribution of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/protein kinase b (akt) pathway in fibrotic processes remains to be investigated. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the pi3k/akt pathway in pulmonary fibrosis. a rat model of pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal administration of bleomycin (blm), and a specific pi3k/akt inhibitor, ly294002, was used to assess the role of the pi3k/akt pathway in fibrogenesis. the inflammatory and fibrotic alterations in the lung tissues were evaluated using histological staining and the hydroxyproline assay. in addition, the concentration of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the expression of akt, phosphorylated (p-)akt, epithelial cadherin, a smooth muscle actin and vimentin in lung tissues. the data demonstrated that an increase in the expression levels of p-akt was involved in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis and contributed to fibrogenesis. administration of the akt inhibitor significantly attenuated inflammation and fibrosis, which was accompanied by a reversal of lung fibrosis-associated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. taken together, these observations suggest that the pi3k/akt pathway serves a central role in the pathophysiology of lung fibrosis, and is a promising therapeutic target.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	human amnion epithelial cells (haecs) have been shown to possess potent immunomodulatory properties across a number of disease models. recently, we reported that haecs influence macrophage polarization and activity, and that this step was dependent on regulatory t cells. in this study, we aimed to assess the effects of haec-derived proresolution lipoxin-a(4) (lxa4) on t-cell, macrophage, and neutrophil phenotype and function during the acute phase of bleomycin-induced lung injury. using c57bl6 mice, we administered 4 million haecs intraperitoneally 24 hours after bleomycin challenge. outcomes were measured at days 3, 5, and 7. haec administration resulted in significant changes to t-cell, macrophage, dendritic cell, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration and phenotypes. endogenous levels of lipoxygenases, lxa4, and the lipoxin receptor fpr2 were elevated in haec-treated animals. furthermore, we showed that the effects of haecs on macrophage phagocytic activity and t-cell suppression are lxa4 dependent, whereas the inhibition of neutrophil-derived myleoperoxidase by haecs is independent of lxa4. this study provides the first evidence that lipid-based mediators contribute to the immunomodulatory effects of haecs and further supports the growing body of evidence that lxa4 is proresolutionary in lung injury. this discovery of lxa4-dependent communication between haecs, macrophages, t cells, and neutrophils is important to the understanding of haec biodynamics and would be expected to inform future clinical applications.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	setting : despite the clinical importance of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), its epidemiology has been rarely reported. the economic burden from ipf is therefore difficult to predict. objective: to analyse the health care burden and current situation with respect to medical resource utilisation in patients with ipf in korea. methods: we analysed nationwide data collected between 2009 and 2013 from the korean health insurance review and assessment (hira) database. patients with ipf were defined by the k-j84.18 code of the korean classification of disease, 6th revision. results: the total direct health care costs increased from us$19 805 167 in 2009 to us$31 410 083 in 2013; the principal factor responsible for the highest proportion of costs was hospitalisation. the proportion of the total ipf patient population who were hospitalised at least once a year was 27.2%, and the average length of hospital stay was 12.7 days. from post-hoc analysis, hospital admission, emergency room visit and intensive care unit admission rates showed significant seasonal variations; the admission rates were highest in the spring and lowest in autumn. conclusions: health care costs of ipf are increasing annually, with hospital admissions representing the major financial burden.
mental_health	there is compelling evidence that teachers and clergy are stressful occupations. this study aimed to compare the rate of job strain and burnout among lay and consecrated teachers and to study the effect of religious coping on the mental health of these two groups. a cross-sectional survey study was carried out in catholic kindergarten, preschool and primary schools of an italian congregation of nuns, in south italy. the italian versions of the maslach burnout inventory-educator survey (mbi-es) scale, of the general health questionnaire (ghq-12) and a study-specific questionnaire with sociodemographic variables and indicators of subjective (self-reported religiosity) and objective (prayer personal and church attendance) religiousness were used. data were analyzed according to the guidelines for data processing and an analysis of the scales used. the participation rate of this study was 88 %. there was a significant difference between two groups in religiousness and job strain/burnout scores (lay teachers were the most affected group). moreover, religiousness scores had a positive correlation with personal accomplishment, job satisfaction and perceived performance and a negative correlation with emotional exhaustion, turnover intention and morbidity psychiatric. therefore, according to religious coping 's research, prayer personal and church attendance can be recommended as two of the ways to prevent job strain and burnout in the teacher work.
mental_health	the current paper provides an overview of the history and development of mental health services with special emphasis on psychotherapy in china. recent epidemiological surveys have revealed high prevalence rates of mental disorders that translate into a huge demand for mental health care. the chinese government responds to such demand by increasing the number and types of mental health professionals in delivering mental health interventions, one of which is cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt). due to unique chinese cultural values, cbt needs to be adapted to these values so as to enhance its acceptability by chinese people. furthermore, training and supervision of chinese therapists require some cultural adaptation in therapist 's training and supervision skills. this paper concludes by providing some specific recommendations on improving the quality and accessibility of cbt in china.
mental_health	background. chinese psychiatrists have gradually started to focus on those who are deemed to be at clinical high-risk (chr)' for psychosis; however, it is still unknown how often those individuals identified as chr from a different country background than previously studied would transition to psychosis. the objectives of this study are to examine baseline characteristics and the timing of symptom onset, help-seeking, or transition to psychosis over a 2-year period in china. method. the presence of chr was determined with the structured interview for prodromal syndromes (sips) at the participants' first visit to the mental health services. a total of 86 (of 117) chr participants completed the clinical follow-up of at least 2 years (73.5%). conversion was determined using the criteria of presence of psychotic symptoms (in sips). analyses examined baseline demographic and clinical predictors of psychosis and trajectory of symptoms over time. survival analysis (kaplan-meier) methods along with log-rank tests were performed to illustrate the relationship of baseline data to either conversion or non-conversion over time. cox regression was performed to identify baseline predictors of conversion by the 2-year follow-up. results. in total 25 (29.1%) of 86 completers transitioned to a psychotic disorder over the course of follow-up. among the chr sample, the mean time between attenuated symptom onset and professional help-seeking was about 4 months on average, and converters developed fully psychotic symptoms about 12 months after symptom onset. compared with those chr participants whose risk syndromes remitted over the course of the study, converters had significantly longer delays (p = 0.029) for their first visit to a professional in search of help. at baseline assessment, the conversion subgroup was younger, had poorer functioning, higher total sips positive symptom scores, longer duration of untreated prodromal symptoms, and were more often given psychosis-related diagnoses and subsequently prescribed antipsychotics in the clinic. conclusions. chinese chr identified primarily by a novel clinical screening approach had a 2-year transition rate comparable with those of specialised help-seeking samples world-wide. early clinical intervention with this functionally deteriorating clinical population who are suffering from attenuated psychotic symptoms, is a next step in applying the chr construct in china.
mental_health	intimate partner abuse (ipa), a major social problem, can lead to mental health conditions and is implicated in 30 % of female and 5 % of male homicide deaths. we hypothesized that due to distinct relationship structures and power dynamics which are immersed in varying sociocultural contexts, victims of male-male, female-female and female-male dyads experience different patterns of ipa. our objectives were: (1) to examine the demographic and clinical characteristics of victims of male victim-male abuser (m-m), female victim-male abuser (f-m), male victim-female abuser (m-f), and female victim-female abuser (f-f) dyads. (2) to compare patterns of ipa reported by the victims in these groups. out of 397 subjects in the general population that attempted this internet-based study, 214 english-speaking subjects were older than 18 years, had experienced ipa, and provided complete information for the analysis. victims of ipa were screened and specific methods of abuse were evaluated. m-ms were significantly more educated (70 %) than other groups. f-fs experienced more abuse before age 18 by a parent or relative. f-fs experienced the most physical abuse while m-ms the least (p = 0.004). physical abuse or threats of abuse in front of children was reported more in f-fs (p < 0.01) and least in m-ms. ipa patterns differ significantly with f-fs presenting the most physical profile and m-ms presenting the least.
mental_health	how does wartime violence affect public attitudes toward the government in the long run? in this paper, we examine whether violence against civilians during the korean war continues to influence people 's attitudes toward the south korean government more than half a century later. we find that wartime violence has clear long-term attitudinal effects. using a difference-in-differences analysis that compares the cohorts born before and after the war, the findings indicate that people who experienced violence in their childhood (0-5 years) are less supportive of the south korean government, especially the administration and the military, compared with those born in the same areas during the 5 years after the war. we argue that the gap between pre- and post-war cohorts is generated by the long-lasting trauma of wartime violence and the social stigma imposed on violence victims after the war.
dementia	objectives: intraindividual variability (iiv) in reaction time refers to the trial-to-trial fluctuations in responding across a given cognitive task. cross-sectional research suggests that iiv increases with normal and neuropathological ageing and it may serve as a marker of neurobiological integrity. this raises the possibility that iiv may also predict future cognitive decline and, indeed, neuropathology. therefore, we conducted a systematic review to address these issues. methods: a search of electronic databases embase, medline, psycinfo, and web of science was completed on may 17, 2016 that identified longitudinal investigations of iiv in middle-aged or older adults. results: a total of 688 studies were initially identified of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. nine included longitudinal iiv measures and 17 predicted subsequent outcome (cognitive decline or impairment, dementia, mortality) from baseline iiv. the results suggested iiv increased over time, particularly in participants aged over 75 years. greater baseline iiv was consistently associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including cognitive decline or impairment, and mortality. conclusions: increased iiv over time is associated with normal ageing. however, further increases in iiv over and above those found in normal ageing may be a risk factor for future cognitive impairment or mortality. measures of iiv may, therefore, have considerable potential as a supplement to existing clinical assessment to aid identification of individuals at risk of adverse outcomes such as dementia or death.
dementia	in recent years, chchd2 and chchd10 mutations were reported to be associated with a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinson 's disease ( pd), although with conflicting results in different populations. the present study aimed to evaluate chchd2 and chchd10 coding variants in italian patients with pd. all the coding regions and flanking intronic splice sites of chchd2 and chchd10 were sequenced. none of our 119 pd cases carried chchd2 mutations, whereas 1 sporadic pd patient showed the pro34ser substitution in chchd10. our data suggest that chchd2 and chcdh10 mutations are not a relevant cause of pd in italian population.

dementia	the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex are core brain regions that anchor the salience network, one of several large-scale intrinsic functional connectivity networks that have been derived consistently using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). while several studies have shown that the insula and anterior cingulate cortex play important roles in interoceptive awareness, no study to date has examined the association between intrinsic salience network connectivity and interoceptive awareness. in this study, we sought to test this idea in 26 healthy young participants who underwent a resting-state fmri scan and a heartbeat counting task outside the scanner in the same session. greater salience network connectivity in the posterior insula (but not the anterior cingulate cortex) using independent component analysis correlated with higher accuracy in the heartbeat counting task. furthermore, using seed-based approach, greater interoceptive accuracy was associated with greater intrinsic connectivity of all insular functional subdivisions to salience network regions, including the anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum and midbrain. these associations remained after correcting for voxel-wise grey matter volumes. the findings underscore the critical role of insular salience network intrinsic connectivity in interoceptive awareness and pave the way for future investigations into how salience network dysconnectivity affects interoceptive awareness in brain disorders.
dementia	abnormal accumulation of tdp-43 into cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions with accompanying nuclear clearance, a common pathology initially identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and frontotemporal dementia (ftd), has also been found in alzheimer' disease (ad). tdp-43 serves as a splicing repressor of non-conserved cryptic exons and that such function is compromised in brains of als and ftd patients, suggesting that nuclear clearance of tdp-43 underlies its inability to repress cryptic exons. however, whether tdp-43 cytoplasmic aggregates are a prerequisite for the incorporation of cryptic exons is not known. here, we assessed hippocampal tissues from 34 human postmortem brains including cases with confirmed diagnosis of ad neuropathologic changes along with age-matched controls. we found that cryptic exon incorporation occurred in all ad cases exhibiting tdp-43 pathology. furthermore, incorporation of cryptic exons was observed in the hippocampus when tdp-43 inclusions was restricted only to the amygdala, the earliest stage of tdp-43 progression. importantly, cryptic exon incorporation could be detected in ad brains lacking tdp-43 inclusion but exhibiting nuclear clearance of tdp-43. these data supports the notion that the functional consequence of nuclear depletion of tdp-43 as determined by cryptic exon incorporation likely occurs as an early event of tdp-43 proteinopathy and may have greater contribution to the pathogenesis of ad than currently appreciated. early detection and effective repression of cryptic exons in ad patients may offer important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for this devastating illness of the elderly.
dementia	background: the organization of long-term care is one of the main challenges of public health and health policies in europe and worldwide, especially in terms of care concepts for people with dementia. in austria and the czech republic the majority of elderly institutionalized persons with dementia are cared for in nursing homes. it is however unclear, how many persons living in nursing homes in austria and in the czech republic are suffering from cognitive impairment and dementia. in addition, basic information on the nutritional status, the status of mobility and the medication prescription patterns are often missing. to facilitate new effective and evidenced based care concepts, basic epidemiological data are in urgent need. thus, demdata was initiated to provide important basic data on persons living in nursing homes in austria and the czech republic for future care planning. methods: demdata is a multicentre mixed methods cross-sectional study. stratified and randomly drawn nursing homes in austria and the czech republic are surveyed. the study protocol used in both study centres assesses four different domains: a) resident, b) care team, c) relative and d) environmental factors. resident 's data include among others health status, cognition, dementia, mobility, nutrition, behavioural symptoms, pain intensity and quality of life. a minimum of 500 residents per country are included into the study (n= 1000 residents). the care team is asked about the use of the person-centred care and their burden. the relatives are asked about the number of visits and proxy-rate the quality of life of their family member. all staff employed in the nursing homes, all residents and relatives can voluntary take part in the study. the environmental factors include among others the organisational category of the nursing home, number of residents, number of rooms, social activities and the care concept. the project started in march 2016 and will be concluded in february 2018. discussion: demdata will provide important epidemiological data on four different nursing home domains in austria and the czech republic, with a focus on the prevalence of dementia in this population. thereby supplying decision and policy makers with important foundation for future care planning.
rheumatoid_arthritis	health services research uses increasingly data from health insurance funds. it is well known that the funds differ with regard to sociodemographic characteristics and morbidity. it is uncertain if there are also differences in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. to compare the sociodemographic characteristics in various health insurance funds and the prevalence of joint disorders and chronic back pain. the 30(th) wave (2013) of the german socioeconomic panel served as a database. average age, sex distribution, nationality, education, and employment status were evaluated according to the health insurance funds. the prevalence of joint disorders and chronic back pain were also stratified according to the insurance funds and standardized according to age and sex. a total of 19,146 participants were included. most participants (4,934) were insured by aok, followed by bkk (2,632) and barmer gek (2,398). there were huge differences among the health insurance funds with regard to the sociodemographic characteristics. for example, the proportion of unemployed insurants was between 33.3 % (ikk) and 50.6 % (aok). the prevalence of joint disorders standardized according to age and sex (20.7 %; 95 % ci: 20.1-21.3) was between 17.4 % (95 % ci: 15.8-19.0; pkv) and 22.4 % (95 % ci: 21.1-23.6; aok). the prevalence of chronic back pain (18.0 %; 95 % ci: 17.4-18.5) was between 13.5 % (95 % ci: 12.2-14.9; pkv) and 20.6 % (95 % ci: 19.4-21.8; aok). there are differences in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among health insurance funds. the extrapolation of analyses of one health insurance fund to the german population is thus limited.
rheumatoid_arthritis	background/purpose we examined the association between hydroxychloroquine (hcq) and plasma lipid and glucose levels in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) cohort. methods this is a retrospective cohort analysis of 1261 ra patients comparing fasting lipid profiles and plasma glucose between patients who were and were not taking hcq. we divided patients into 3 groups based on hcq exposure during follow-up: those who had never taken hcq, those who took it intermittently, and those who took it continuously. we used multivariable models and propensity scoring to compensate for the effect of nonrandom treatment assignment. results we followed 1261 ra patients for a total of 4605 observations between 1996 and 2014. after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards), lipid-lowering medications, body mass index (bmi), and smoking, patients taking hcq at baseline had significantly lower total cholesterol (tc) (p 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (ldl) (p 0.001), triglycerides (p = 0.013), and lipid profile ratios tc/high-density lipoprotein (hdl) (p 0.001) and ldl/hdl (p 0.001), as well as higher hdl (p 0.001). in longitudinal analyses, after adjusting for confounders, patients who continuously took hcq showed significantly lower tc, ldl, tc/hdl, and ldl/hdl and higher hdl (p 0.01). fasting plasma glucose levels were not significantly associated with hcq exposure. conclusions hydroxychloroquine use was associated with lower lipid levels but not with the plasma glucose in this ra cohort. these findings support the need for a randomized trial to establish the role of hcq in cardiovascular disease prevention in ra patients.
rheumatoid_arthritis	autoimmune polyendocrinopathy with candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy (apeced) is a rare disorder of immune dysregulation caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (aire) gene. individuals affected with apeced develop a clinical syndrome characterized by ectodermal abnormalities, autoantibody production, and organ-specific autoimmune manifestations. inflammatory arthritis is usually not described as a part of the syndrome, and only sporadic cases are reported. we describe the case of a preschool-age girl who presented with hypoparathyroidism, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and chronic polyarthritis at 4 years of age and was found to have two compound heterozygous disease-associated mutations in the aire gene. we also conducted a literature review of the main characteristics of inflammatory arthritis in apeced patients. our case and review demonstrate that (1) inflammatory arthritis, although rare, can be an early manifestation of apeced; (2) the diagnosis of apeced should be considered if mucocutaneous candidiasis, multiple organ-specific autoimmune manifestations, polyendocrinopathy, especially hypoparathyroidism or adrenal failure, or ectodermal dystrophy accompany joint symptoms; and (3) genotyping interpretation should take into account that mutations are found in the 14 exons of the gene, compound heterozygosity is common, and in some cases, only one or no mutated alleles are found.
rheumatoid_arthritis	systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is an autoimmune disease characterized by extensive immune response, including over-activation of t and b cell development of pathogenic autoantibodies, organ damage induced by the formation and deposition of immune complex and the abnormal elevation of type i interferon. semaphorin5a (sema5a) is involved essentially in immune cell regulation and is also implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. we aimed to evaluate the role of sema5a in patients with sle. serum levels of sema5a were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) in 152 sle patients and 48 healthy controls. the message ribonucleic acid (mrna) expression levels of sema5a and adam metallopeptidase domain 17 (adam17) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from 43 patients with sle and 19 healthy controls were detected by the real-time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). serum sema5a levels were increased significantly in sle patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0001). elevated levels of sema5a were correlated positively with 24-h proteinuria excretion (r=0558, p < 00001), sle disease activity index (sledai) (r=0278, p=00006) and c-reactive protein (crp) (r=0266, p=0002), but negatively with planet (plt) (r=-0294, p=00003) and complement 3 (c3) (r=-0287, p=00004) in sle patients. patients with elevated sema5a levels showed higher incidence of rash, serositis and nephritis (p < 005 or p < 0001). patients with decreased plt, c3 or positive for proteinuria also showed elevated sema5a (p < 0001 or p < 005). the mrna adam17 was increased in sle patients and correlated positively with serum sema5a levels. our data demonstrated that elevated serum sema5a in sle patients correlated with disease activity and are involved in kidney and blood system damage; adam17 might be involved in the release of secreted sema5a.
rheumatoid_arthritis	introduction: autonomic neuropathy (an), found to be a strong predictor of sudden cardiac death, has been reported variably in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). manifesting as sweating disturbances, gastrointestinal irregularities, bladder or erectile dysfunction, an can significantly affect a patient 's quality of life and alter the course of the disease. aim: this study was undertaken to find out the prevalence and severity of an in ra patients attending the rheumatology clinic at a tertiary care hospital in new delhi, india and also to investigate its correlation with patient and disease factors such as age, gender, disease severity, duration and serological status. materials and methods: in this cross-sectional study, an was assessed subjectively by a survey of autonomic symptoms. cardiac autonomic involvement was assessed by five cardiovascular reflex tests as described by ewing: heart rate (hr), response to deep breathing, standing, and valsalva and blood pressure (bp) response to standing and sustained handgrip. results: a total of 31 ra patients and 31 age and sex matched healthy volunteers were recruited. upon analysis it was found that the prevalence of cardiac an was significantly higher in patients (80.65%) as compared to controls (51.61%) (p=0.016). positive correlation with disease severity was observed with the patient reported questionnaire but not with the objective cardiovascular reflex tests. no significant correlation between grade of an and patient 's age, gender, disease duration or serological status was established. conclusion: at the end of the study, it was concluded that the pathological mechanisms responsible for autonomic dysfunction are more active in ra as compared to others.
osteoporosis	platycodon grandiflorum root-derived saponins (changkil saponins, cks) are reported to have many pharmacological activities. in our latest research, cks was proven to have a significant osteogenic effect. however, the detail molecular mechanism of cks on osteoclastic differentiation has not been fully investigated. administration of cks considerably reduced ovx-induced bone loss, and ameliorated the reduction in plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus observed in ovx mice. cks also repressed the deterioration of bone trabecular microarchitecture. interestingly, platycodin d, the most abundant and major pharmacological constituent of triterpenoid cks, inhibited receptor activator of nf-kappa b ligand (rankl)-induced activation of nf-kappa b, and erk and p38 mapk, ultimately repressing osteoclast differentiation. ovx-induced bone turnover was attenuated by cks, possibly via repression of osteoclast differentiation by platycodin d, the active component of cks. platycodin d can be regarded as an antiosteoporotic candidate for treatment of osteoporosis diseases.

osteoporosis	low bone mass leads to fracture risk. osteoporosis affects over 10% of the population and one of every two women over the age of 50years. genetics predicts more than half of bone mass. diet and weight bearing exercise are two lifestyle choices that can influence the risk of fracture. nutrients are the structural constituents of bone. as bone is a living tissue and turns over, albeit more slowly than other tissues, there is an obligatory loss of minerals daily that must be replaced through diet. three servings of dairy products daily are recommended to replace those losses. alternative sources of nutrients can come from calcium fortified orange juice, plant-based beverages, or tofu to provide many nutrients needed for bone health. supplements can provide nutrients at risk for being inadequate such as calcium or vitamin d.
osteoporosis	this study compares spinal volumetric bone mineral density (vbmd) with spinal areal bone mineral density (abmd) among young adults from 3 eastern provincial capital cities in mainland china. a total of 416 young adults (age range: 20-40 yr) from 3 eastern provincial capital cities (beijing, shanghai, and guangzhou) in mainland china were recruited in this study. from each subject, the vbmd of the lumbar spine was measured by the mindways quantitative computed tomography system. moreover, the abmd of the lumbar spine, measured by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, was extracted from a previous multicenter large-scale study, and the 420 participants were matched by age, gender, height, weight, as well as geographic territory. the vbmd and the abmd values were further compared and analyzed. generally, the bone mineral density (bmd) results were significantly different among participants from the 3 cities (p < 0.05). specifically, both vbmd and abmd values of participants from beijing were significantly different from those from guangzhou (p0.05). interestingly, the overall mean vbmd value was 5.9% greater in women than those in men for all the 3 cities (p < 0.001). this study demonstrated an overall heterogeneity in spinal bmd among young adults from 3 eastern provincial capital cities in mainland china. specifically, the taller and heavier young adults from the northern part of china have smaller spinal vbmd but higher spinal abmd values than those who were shorter and lighter from the southern part of china.
osteoporosis	more than 81% of the studied women had a poor knowledge of different aspects of osteoporosis and its complications, suggesting that more educational programs targeting women in particular are needed to help improve the osteoporosis practice in the societies and reduce the burden of the disease. purpose the family structure has changed considerably in the past decade. but, women from iran and many countries in the region and even families with similar cultural background living in other parts of the world are still responsible for childcare as well as the lifestyle adapted by the family. the present study was conducted to assess the awareness of the female head of household of osteoporosis and its complications. methods as part of a population-based study in two iranian cities, arak and sannandaj, to study osteoporosis and its risk factors, a questionnaire on the knowledge of female head of households of osteoporosis and its complications was completed. the subsample filled out the knowledge survey along with the questionnaire on their demographic data, socioeconomic status (ses), reproductive factors, bone-related lifestyle habits, family and personal medical history, medication use, and compliance with osteoporosis medication (if used) as well as a ffq filled out for all the 2100 participants. they also underwent a bone mineral density (bmd) test, and their serum levels of vitamin d were calculated. these data were then used to assess the factors affecting their awareness level. results the knowledge of 81.3% (473) of the studied women was found to be poor on different aspects of osteoporosis and its complications. multivariate analysis revealed that each level increase in vit d intake tertile increases the chance of higher awareness level in k=total by 1.5 times. each level increase in physical activity tertile was associated with a 30.6% lower chance of having a good knowledge. conclusion considering the poor awareness level of the studied women and their poor practice of bone healthy behavior, one could conclude that more programs are needed or the content/delivery style of the existing ones should be optimized.
osteoporosis	sclerostin antibodies increase bone mass by stimulating bone formation. however, human and animal studies show that bone formation increases transiently and returns to pre-treatment level despite ongoing antibody treatment. to understand its mechanism of action, we studied the time course of bone formation, correlating the rate and extent of accrual of bone mass and strength after sclerostin antibody treatment. ovariectomized (ovx) rats were treated with a sclerostin-antibody (scle-ab) at 20 mg/kg sc once weekly and sacrificed at baseline and 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post-treatment. in scle-ab treated rats, serum pinp and ocn rapidly increased at week 1, peaked around week 3, and returned to ovx control levels by week 6. transcript analyses from the distal femur revealed an early increase in bone formation followed by a sustained decrease in bone resorption genes. lumbar vertebral (lv) osteoblast surface increased 88% by week 2, and bone formation rate (bfr/bs) increased 138% by week 4. both parameters were below ovx control by week 8. bone formation was primarily a result of modeling based formation. endocortical and periosteal bfr/bs peaked around week 4 at 313% and 585% of ovx control, respectively. bfr/bs then declined but remained higher than ovx control on both surfaces through week 8. histomorphometric analyses showed lv-bv/tv did not further increase after week 4, while bmd continued to increase at lv, mid femur (mf), and femoral neck (fn) through week 8. biomechanical tests showed a similar improvement in bone strength through 8 weeks in mf and fn, but bone strength plateaued between weeks 6 and 8 for lv. our data suggest that bone formation with scle-ab treatment is rapid and modeling formation dominated in ovx rats. although transient, the bone formation response persists longer in cortical than trabecular bone.

medicare	study design. cervical decompression (cd) and cervical fusion (cf) patients in 5% medicare part b claims data. objective. evaluate the complication rate and associated risk factors after cervical spine surgery using a national sample of elderly patients. summary of background data. the number of cervical spine procedures in the united states has risen along with associated hospital costs. postoperative complications lead to longer hospitalizations and greater costs. methods. demographic information and postoperative complications (90 days) were evaluated. multivariate cox regression was used to evaluate the risk factors for the complications, while adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, charlson comorbidity index, race, census region, sex, and year of surgery. results. between 2010 and 2012, 1519 cd and 1273 cf medicare patients were identified in the dataset. respiratory complications (cd: 12.1% and cf: 14.6%), urinary retention (cd: 8.2% and cf: 9.1%), acute delirium (cd: 5.3% and cf: 6.0%), and nausea/vomiting (cd: 2.8% and cf: 3.1%) were the most commonly diagnosed complications. all other complications had an incidence of less than 1.5%. older patients had higher risks of respiratory complications for both procedures, and cd patients with charlson scores of 1 to 2 and 5+ were also at higher risk of respiratory complications. males (p < 0.001) were at higher risk of urinary retention. patients with dementia (p < 0.001) had a higher risk of acute delirium after both cd and cf. for cd patients, those aged 85 years and over had higher risk of acute delirium, along with patients with transient ischemic attack/stroke. age was also a significant risk factor (p=0.019) for acute delirium for cf patients. females were at a significantly higher risk of nausea/vomiting after cd and cf. conclusion. these data help to provide baseline information regarding the complication rates in the elderly cd and cf patient population in the united states, and will serve to help minimize these complications.
medicare	objectives: to determine whether bundled payments are feasible in the orthopaedic fracture setting, and the potential economic implications of this reimbursement structure. design: prospective. setting: multicenter. patients/participants: between 2004 and 2014, a total of 23,643 operatively treated patients with fracture and 544,067 patients with total joint arthroplasty (tja) were identified using the new york state statewide planning and research cooperative system database. interventions: severity of illness (soi), hospital charges ($usd), length of stay (los; days), and discharge disposition (homebound vs. not) were collected. main outcome measurements: patients were subdivided into groups of minor and severe soi. differences in hospital charges, los, and discharge disposition were analyzed. differences in charges, los, and discharges were further analyzed based on minor and severe soi. results: the difference in hospital charge between patients with minor or severe soi undergoing elective tja ranged between 153% and 211%. in contrast, patients undergoing fracture surgery exhibited differences ranging from 314% to 489% between minor and severe soi levels. similar differences were observed regarding mean hospital los and homebound discharge disposition, with patients with fracture demonstrating greater sensitivity to increasing soi. conclusions: although bundled payments may be a viable option for patients undergoing elective tja, this payment model requires particular attention when applied to fracture care.
medicare	objective: to identify potential risk factors associated with rehospitalization among medicare recipients with heart failure (hf) receiving telehomecare. materials and methods: this study is a nonexperimental, cross-sectional secondary data analysis of the centers for medicare and medicaid (cms) mandated assessment called the outcome and assessment information set (oasis)-c, provided by a large home care company. a total of 526 patients who received telehomecare from january 1, 2011 to august 31, 2013 were included in the analyses, which used multiple logistic regression. results: the overall rate of rehospitalization was 36% while patients were receiving telehomecare. moderately frail health status (p = 0.01), the presence of severe pain (p = 0.01), the presence of dermatologic problems (p = 0.03), and independence in dressing one 's lower body (compared to slightly dependent [p = 0.01] or mostly dependent patient groups [p = 0.02]) were identified as risk factors for rehospitalization. conclusions: the risk factors identified from this study may be used to drive more effective telehomecare placements, and referrals for additional services among telehomecare patients with hf.
medicare	objective: most prior studies on aggressive end-of-life care in older patients with cancer have accounted for social determinants of health (e.g., race, income, and education), but rarely for multimoribidity (mm). in this study, we examine the association between end-of-life care and each of the social determinants of health and mm, hypothesizing that higher mm is associated with less aggressive care. methods: from the linked 1991-2008 health and retirement study, medicare data, and the national death index, we identified fee-for-service patients age >= 66 years who died from cancer (n = 835). mm was defined as the occurrence or co-occurrence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes. aggressive care was based on claims-derived measures of receipt of cancer-directed treatment in the last two weeks of life; admission to the hospital and/or emergency department (ed) within the last month; and in-hospital death. we also identified patients enrolled in hospice. in multivariable logistic regression models, we analyzed the associations of interest, adjusting for potential confounders. results: while 61.2% of the patients enrolled in hospice, 24.6% underwent cancer-directed treatment; 55.1% were admitted to the hospital and/or ed; and 21.7% died in the hospital. we observed a u-shaped distribution between income and in-hospital death. chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes were associated with some outcomes, but not with others. conclusions: to improve quality end-of-life care and curtail costs incurred by dying patients, relevant interventions need to account for social determinants of health and mm in a nuanced fashion.

psoriatic_arthritis	purpose of the review we will address current treatment and unmet needs in psoriatic arthritis (psa), examine existing randomized controlled trials (rcts), and consider options for new trial designs and challenges in their implementation. recent findings while therapeutic options for psa have rapidly increased, there continues to be a need for clinical trials to test new therapies and establish optimal treatment strategies in order to improve the care for patients with psa. in addition, more data is needed on how to select the best therapy for a given patient in clinical practice. consideration of alternative outcome measures is also needed. summary despite the rapid expansion in the number of therapy options available, there is still much to be learned about how to treat the individual patient with psa.
psoriatic_arthritis	in most chronic inflammatory diseases, the cause remains unknown. chronic infection is, however, among the current hypotheses. recent technological advances have allowed in-depth studies of the gut microflora, or microbiota, which contains a vast array of organisms, most of which cannot be cultured. inflammatory bowel disease has been associated with distinctive changes in the gut microbiota, which persist between disease flares and may play a pathogenic role. links have been demonstrated between the gut microbiota and joint inflammation in murine models of arthritis but have received little attention in human patients. recent work has nevertheless demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or spondyloarthritis, with differences across diagnoses and studies. interestingly, some of these alterations resemble those now firmly established in inflammatory bowel disease; examples include decreased microbial diversity and lower frequencies of bacterial groups belonging to the firmicutes phylum known to have immunoregulatory properties. these new findings open up important new horizons both for understanding disease and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies.

psoriatic_arthritis	background: the prevalence and clinical characteristics of psoriatic arthritis (psa) in patients with psoriasis are not well described in asian populations, including koreans. objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of psa by using the classification of psoriatic arthritis (caspar) criteria on the basis of physical examination only, as well as its correlation with psoriasis severity and other medical conditions including nail psoriasis. methods: a single-center, cross-sectional observational cohort study was conducted, and the included patients were evaluated for psa according to the caspar criteria. the psoriasis area severity index (pasi) and the nail psoriasis severity index (napsi) were calculated. results: the prevalence of psa in patients with psoriasis in korea was 13.5%. when performing logistic regression, hyperlipidemia and localized pustular psoriasis were found to be significant predictors of psa. the pasi score was significantly higher in psa patients than in those with psoriasis alone (p=0.014). psoriatic nail involvement was found in 85.5% of the study population, and all psa patients had nail psoriasis. the mean napsi score was higher in patients with psa; however, the difference was not statistically significant. conclusion: there was a close relation between psoriasis severity and psa, although nail psoriasis severity was not related to psa status. dermatologists can diagnose psa from current physical findings by using the caspar criteria. to validate the caspar criteria for psa diagnosis, the definition of nail psoriasis clinical types and severity in the caspar criteria should be reviewed again.
psoriatic_arthritis	background: recent global data show an increasing prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in western countries. objective: the current study analyzed the trend of prevalence rates of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in taiwan and examined biologic prescription patterns by different specialties. methods: data were accessed from the national payer national health insurance research database in taiwan. this study protocol was approved by joint institutional review board established by medical research ethics foundation (no 13-s-001). results: between 2003 and 2013, the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis increased by 41% (from 15.54 to 21.90 per 10,000 population) and 191% (from 0.45 to 1.31 per 10,000 population), respectively, while the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis among patients with psoriatic disease increased from 6.3% to 12.7%. dermatologists are the main caregivers for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; however, data suggest a decreasing trend in the proportion of dermatologists for psoriasis patients from 24.7% between 2003 and 2008 to 10.74% between 2008 and 2013, with a corresponding decrease in dermatologists for psoriatic arthritis patients from 62.30% to 44.65% during the same periods, respectively. in 2013, of the 51,191 patients with psoriasis, only 596 (1.16%) received biologics (73.3% by dermatologists and 25.8% by rheumatologists), while 1120 of the 7470 (14.99%) psoriatic arthritis patients received biologics (72.8% by rheumatologists and 223% by dermatologists). the proportion of biologics use was 1.12% and 7.75% among all patients with only psoriasis and 8.01% and 26.70% among all patients with psoriatic arthritis seen by dermatologists and rheumatologists, respectively. conclusion: the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is increasing in taiwan. the use of biologics in patients with psoriatic arthritis was comparable to that reported in previous studies in the united states and europe; however, the use of biologics remained low in patients with psoriasis in taiwan.

psoriatic_arthritis	apremilast is an orally-active small molecule which inhibits phosphodiesterase-4 (pde4). clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in psoriatic arthritis (psa) and psoriasis. established therapeutic options have variable effectiveness across the different domains of psoriatic disease. whilst biologic therapies have proven to be of significant benefit to many patients, not all patients respond, and others are not eligible or do not tolerate biologic therapy. we review the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and clinical trial data with regards to both efficacy and safety for apremilast and consider where this new treatment may be positioned in the treatment of psa.
addiction	public health research treats intimate partnerships as sites of risk management, including in the management of hiv and hepatitis c transmission. this risk-infused biomedical approach tends to undermine appreciation of the emotional and socially situated meanings of care in intimate partnerships. in this article we explore qualitative interview accounts of the care enacted in partnerships between people who inject drugs, drawing on a 2014 study of 34 couples and 12 individuals living in two locations of australia. a thematic analysis highlights 'best friend relationships', 'doing everything together', 'co-dependency', and 'doing normalcy' as core to narratives of care. as we will argue, the accounts position the care undertaken by couples as at once shaped by day-to-day practices of drug use and by social situation, with the partnership enacting care as a form of social protection, including protection from stigma and other environmental hostilities. the intimacy of doing everything together offers insulation against stigma, yet also reproduces its isolating effects. while the care produced in drug-using partnerships is presented as double-edged, we note how interview accounts are used to deflect the charge that these relationships represent harmful co-dependency. taken together, the interview accounts negotiate a 'counter-care' in relation to normalcy, presenting the intimate partnership between people who use drugs as a legitimate embodiment of care.

addiction	this study aimed to examine the associations of individual trajectories of three types of negative affect (na: anxiety, depression, and anger) and craving during a 44-day period of incentivized smoking abstinence period with cessation outcome at 3 months and at 1 year. adult smokers (n = 140) completed questionnaire assessments of na and craving during pre-quit baseline sessions and 15 postquit sessions over the 45 days of biochemically verified abstinence while on nicotine or placebo patch treatment. growth curve and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations of trajectory parameters of the individual na states and craving with the abstinence outcomes at 3 months and 1 year postquit. greater declines in anxiety, depression, and anger symptoms over the first 44 days of smoking cessation were predictive of higher odds of abstinence at both 3 months and 1 year. moreover, the greater declines in anxiety and anger remained as significant predictors of abstinence at both time points, independent of the predictive ability of the trajectory profiles of craving. the findings suggest that slower dissipation of na, especially anxiety and anger, represents a greater risk for relapse to smoking beyond that predicted by craving during early abstinence. thus, temporal profiles of the affective symptoms convey unique motivational significance in relapse. reduction in na during early abstinence may be a valid target for interventions to increase long-term cessation success rates particularly among individuals with refractory affective symptoms.
addiction	the high rate of relapse to drug use is one of the main problems in the treatment of addiction. stress plays the essential role in drug abuse and relapse; nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms underlying stress and relapse. accordingly, the effects of intra-accumbal administration of sulpiride, as a dopamine d2-like receptor antagonist, on an ineffective morphine dose1food deprivation(fd)-and morphine priming-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference (cpp). about 104 adult male albino wistar rats weighing 200-280 g were bilaterally implanted by cannula into the nucleus accumbens (nac). subcutaneous (sc) injection of morphine (5 mg kg21) was used daily during a 3-day conditioning phase. after a 24-hr "" off"" period following achievement of extinction criterion, rats were tested for fd-and priming-induced reinstatement of morphine cpp by an ineffective (0.5 mg kg21, sc) and priming (1 mg kg21, sc) dose of morphine, respectively. in the next experiments, animals received different doses of intra-accumbal sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mg/ 0.5 ml saline) bilaterally and were subsequently tested for morphine reinstatement. our findings indicated that the 24-hr fd facilitated reinstatement of morphine cpp. furthermore, the d2-like receptor antagonist attenuated the ineffective morphine dose1 fd-and priming-induced reinstatement of morphine cpp dose-dependently. also, contribution of d2-like receptors in mediation of the ineffective morphine dose1 fd-induced reinstatement of cpp was greater than morphine priming-induced reinstatement of cpp. the role of dopaminergic system in morphine reinstatement through a neural pathway in the nac provides the evidence that d2-like receptor antagonist can be useful therapeutic targets for reinstatement of morphine cpp.
addiction	this study was aimed to test the association between perceived stress and problematic social networking site (sns) usage, and to figure out whether psychological resilience moderated this relationship. the perceived stress scale, connor-davidson resilience scale, and facebook intrusion questionnaire were administered to 499 chinese college students. the results showed that (1) perceived stress was positively associated with problematic sns usage; (2) psychological resilience was negatively related with problematic sns usage; and (3) psychological resilience moderated the relationship between perceived stress and problematic sns usage. specifically, the relationship between perceived stress and problematic sns usage was statistically significant for students with a lower level of psychological resilience, while no significant association was found for those with a higher level of psychological resilience. the findings emphasize the importance of enhancing psychological resilience to decrease the likelihood of college students who experience higher level of stress from using sns problematically.

addiction	studying brain abnormalities in behavioral addiction including gd enables us to exclude possible confounding effects of exposure to neurotoxic substances, which should provide important insight that can lead to a better understanding of addiction per se. there have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for gd, although the results have been inconsistent. on the other hand, gd was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude. we aimed to examine the heterogeneity of gd by combining a behavioral economics task and voxel-based morphometry. thirty-six male gd patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion, which can assess risk attitude in real-life decision-making. the gd patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion, low and high. while both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum, high loss-aversion gd showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. our study suggests that the heterogeneity of gd is underpinned at the brain structural level. this result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for gd.

atopic_dermatitis	purpose: atopic dermatitis (ad) is a chronic eczematous dermatitis that has a high prevalence and diverse clinical features. although several hypotheses about its multifactorial pathogenesis have been suggested, the cause is not yet fully understood. a better understanding of the clinical features may helpful inelucidating the pathogenesis of ad. methods: this retrospective study analyzed the questionnaires, medical charts, and laboratory examination results of 5,000 patients diagnosed with ad at a.single tertiary hospital in korea. results: the demographics, allergic comorbidities, family history, severity, and treatment experiences of the patients were analyzed. most of the patients were adults, 76.3% of whom were classified as havingan extrinsic type of ad. the mean eczema area and severity index (easi) score was found to be 13.68, and adult patients were found to have higher severity than the other age groups. the anatomical involvements were different among the age groups, with more involvements of the head and neck in adults. the patients reported seasonal changes and stress as the factors that aggravated their symptoms the most. topical steroids and oral cyclosporine were the most used medications at our clinic, whereas 10.1% of the patients underwent allergen -specific immunotherapy. conclusions: this analysis of 5,000 patients would lead to a better understanding of various subtypes and diverse clinical features of ad in koreans. distinct characteristics were observed among different age groups; thus, treatment strategies may need to be differentiated accordingly.
atopic_dermatitis	atopic dermatitis (ad) is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that is usually seen in childhood, but can onset or persist into adulthood. the characteristic distribution and morphology based on age, chronic relapsing course, and pruritus comprise the clinical criteria used in the diagnosis of ad. however, the numerous morphologies ranging from acute, weeping erythematous papules to chronic lichenified plaques, can be simulated by multiple other conditions, including inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and photo-dermatoses. recognition of the distinguishing features and clinical mimickers of atopic dermatitis is vital for an accurate and timely diagnosis, and initiation of proper treatment regimens.
atopic_dermatitis	the majority of research in the staphylococcus field has been dedicated to the understanding of staphylococcus aureus infections. in contrast, there is limited information on infections by coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) and how the host responds to them. s. epidermidis, a member of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, is an important commensal organism of the human skin and mucous membranes; and there is emerging evidence of its benefit for human health in fighting off harmful microorganisms. however, s. epidermidis can cause opportunistic infections, which include particularly biofilm-associated infections on indwelling medical devices. these often can disseminate into the bloodstream; and in fact, s. epidermidis is the most frequent cause of nosocomial sepsis. the increasing use of medical implants and the dramatic shift in the patient demographic population in recent years have contributed significantly to the rise of s. epidermidis infections. furthermore, treatment has been complicated by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. today, s. epidermidis is a major nosocomial pathogen posing significant medical and economic burdens. in this review, we present the current understanding of mechanisms of host defense against the prototypical cons species s. epidermidis as a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes, and during biofilm-associated infection and sepsis.
atopic_dermatitis	background: genetic differences in the target proteins, metabolizing enzymes and transporters that contribute to inter-individual differences in drug response are not integrated in contemporary drug development programs. ayurveda, that has propelled many drug discovery programs albeit for the search of new chemical entities incorporates inter-individual variability ""prakriti"" in development and administration of drug in an individualized manner. prakriti of an individual largely determines responsiveness to external environment including drugs as well as susceptibility to diseases. prakriti has also been shown to have molecular and genomic correlates. we highlight how integration of prakriti concepts can augment the efficiency of drug discovery and development programs through a unique initiative of ayurgenomics trisutra consortium. methods: five aspects that have been carried out are (1) analysis of variability in fda approved pharmacogenomics genes/snps in exomes of 72 healthy individuals including predominant prakriti types and matched controls from a north indian indo-european cohort (2) establishment of a consortium network and development of five genetically homogeneous cohorts from diverse ethnic and geo-climatic background (3) identification of parameters and development of uniform standard protocols for objective assessment of prakriti types (4) development of protocols for prakriti evaluation and its application in more than 7500 individuals in the five cohorts (5) development of data and sample repository and integrative omits pipelines for identification of genomic correlates. results: highlight of the study are (1) exome sequencing revealed significant differences between prakriti types in 28 snps of 11 fda approved genes of pharmacogenomics relevance viz. cyp2c19, cyp2b6, esr1, f2, pgr, hla-b, eila-dqa1, hla-drb1, ldlr, cftr, cps1. these variations are polymorphic in diverse indian and world populations included in 1000 genomes project. (2) based on the phenotypic attributes of prakriti we identified anthropometry for anatomical features, biophysical parameters for skin types, hrv for autonomic function tests, spirometry for vital capacity and gustometry for taste thresholds as objective parameters. (3) comparison of prakriti phenotypes across different ethnic, age and gender groups led to identification of invariant features as well as some that require weighted considerations across the cohorts. conclusion: considering the molecular and genomics differences underlying prakriti and relevance in disease pharmacogenomics studies, this novel integrative platform would help in identification of differently susceptible and drug responsive population. additionally, integrated analysis of phenomic and genomic variations would not only allow identification of clinical and genomic markers of prakriti for application in personalized medicine but also its integration in drug discovery and development programs.

atopic_dermatitis	over the past decade, a vast array of nanomaterials has been created through the development of nanotechnology. with the increasing application of these nanomaterials in various fields, such as foods, cosmetics, and medicines, there has been concern about their safety, that is, nanotoxicity. therefore, there is an urgent need to collect information about the biological effects of nanomaterials so that we can exploit their potential benefits and design safer nanomaterials, while avoiding nanotoxicity as a result of inhalation or skin exposure. in particular, the immunomodulating effect of nanomaterials is one of most interesting aspects of nanotoxicity. however, the immunomodulating effects of nanomaterials through skin exposure have not been adequately discussed compared with the effects of inhalation exposure, because skin penetration by nanomaterials is thought to be extremely low under normal conditions. on the other hand, the immunomodulatory effects of nanomaterials via skin may cause severe problems for people with impaired skin barrier function, because some nanomaterials could penetrate the deep layers of their allergic or damaged skin. in addition, some studies, including ours, have shown that nanomaterials could exhibit significant immunomodulating effects even if they do not penetrate the skin. in this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the allergic responses induced by nanomaterials upon skin exposure. first, we discuss nanomaterial penetration of the intact or impaired skin barrier. next, we describe the immunomodulating effects of nanomaterials, focusing on the sensitization potential of nanomaterials and the effects of co-exposure of nanomaterials with substances such as chemical sensitizers or allergens, on the onset of allergy, following skin exposure. finally, we discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the immunomodulating effects of nanomaterials by describing the involvement of the protein corona in the interaction of nanomaterials with biological components and by presenting recent data about the adjuvant effects of well-characterized particle adjuvant, aluminum salt, as an example of immunomodulatory particulate.
digestive_health	gastrointestinal health in regard to the gut microbiome is a rapidly emerging field and has many key components driving its emergence. fibre, prebiotics and probiotics are all dietary components that can play a critical role in maintaining a healthy gut microflora. fibre has long been appreciated for its influential role in cardiovascular disease, glycaemic control and weight management through various physiological mechanisms. prebiotics have been shown to play an influential role in irritable bowel symptoms/disease, colon cancer, cardiovascular disease and overall digestive health. together, various types of fibres and prebiotics have been targeted and synthesised to influence the gut microbiome, specifically lactobacillus and bifidobacterium populations. lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium spp. are common markers for gut health because they have been shown to down-regulate inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, alleviate irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, stimulate immune functions, aid in mineral absorption and produce little, if any, gas or known carcinogenic substances. probiotics have also been shown to display many of these pro-health components, and include many species of bacteria outside of the commonly utilised lactobacillus and bifidobacterium populations. how these dietary components are defined in the scientific and political arenas will play a critical role in the success of the gut health field moving forward. key changes in administrative definitions and requirements of these dietary components will influence consumption, awareness and understanding of these key influential components. the purpose of this review is to provide current accepted definitions for fibre, prebiotics and probiotics, as well as introduce key scientific studies describing the health benefits of these components, as well as current health claims.
digestive_health	the integrity of oral and digestive mucosa depend on many salivary components like the epidermal growth factor (egf). sometimes indicative, sometimes stimulated or modulated factor of oral and digestive health, egf appears as a clinical marker in neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. as cellular growth factor, it protects the digestive mucosa with stimulation of mucus production and with inhibition of gastric secretion. equally implicated in healing process, it enhances this one, and determines, in patients, more or less sensibility to inflammatory damages. its strategic place in various pathologies, as stomach ulcer and tumoral process, open research prospects with a real potential of repair and pronostic.

digestive_health	cereal-based foods are key components of the diet and they dominate most food-based dietary recommendations in order to achieve targets for intake of carbohydrate, protein and dietary fibre. processing (milling) of grains to produce refined grain products removes key nutrients and phytochemicals from the flour and although in some countries nutrients may be replaced with mandatory fortification, overall this refinement reduces their potential nutritional quality. there is increasing evidence from both observational and intervention studies that increased intake of less-refined, whole-grain (wg) foods has positive health benefits. the highest wg consumers are consistently shown to have lower risk of developing cvd, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. wg consumers may also have better digestive health and are likely to have lower bmi and gain less weight over time. the bulk of the evidence for the benefits of wg comes from observational studies, but evidence of benefit in intervention studies and potential mechanisms of action is increasing. overall this evidence supports the promotion of wg foods over refined grain foods in the diet, but this would require adoption of standard definitions of 'whole grain' and 'whole-grain foods' which will enable innovation by food manufacturers, provide clarity for the consumer and encourage the implementation of food-based dietary recommendations and public health strategies.
digestive_health	the effect of dietary inclusion of white lupin seed (wls) on the milk composition and yield of rabbit does as well as the performance of their litters was studied. two lactation diets having identical digestible protein (dp): de ratio and two weaning diets having identical dp: de ratio were formulated. the first lactation diet (sl) contained soybean meal (sbm; 13.0%) and sunflower meal (5.0%) as the main cp sources, whereas the second lactation diet (ll) was based on wls (25.0%). as a result, the ll diet had a greater ether extract (ee) content than did the sl diet. the first weaning diet (sw) included sbm (7.0%) as the main cp source, whereas the second weaning diet (lw) diet was based on wls (12.0%). no additional fat was added to any of the diets. a total of 32 (16 per treatment) hyplus ps 19 does (4,225 +/- 607 g bw, at the second parturition) were fed 1 of the 2 lactation diets. the litters were standardized to 9 kits (564 +/- 81 g bw) on the day of birth and were fed 1 of the 2 weaning diets from d 17 to 69 of age. at d 30 of age (weaning), 66 rabbits on each weaning diet (689 +/- 71 g bw; 3 per cage) were used to evaluate performance. feed intake and doe bw were not affected by the dietary treatments. milk yield tended to be higher between d 1 and 30 of lactation in does fed the ll diet (p = 0.094), a finding that is related to the higher dietary ee content and intake in the ll diet. when expressed per kilogram of metabolic weight, milk output (p < 0.05) and fat output (p < 0.05) were greater in these does. improved g:f (p < 0.05) between d 1 and 21 of lactation and greater adg (p = 0.072) and milk efficiency (p < 0.05) of litters was observed in does fed the ll diet. the milk of does fed the ll diet contained less linoleic acid (p < 0.05) and arachidonic acid (c 20:4n-6; p < 0.05) and more oleic acid (p < 0.05), alpha-linolenic acid (p < 0.05), and eicosapentaenic acid (p < 0.05), with a corresponding increase in the total pufa n-3: c 20:4n-6 ratio (p < 0.05). the performance of fattening rabbits was not affected by dietary treatment. the number of ill plus dead rabbits caused by digestive disease was lower (p < 0.05) in rabbits fed the lw diet. therefore, wls is a suitable dietary cp source for lactating does that can replace traditionally used cp sources without adverse effects on feed intake and milk yield or on the growth and viability of their litters. due to its fatty acid (fa) composition, the use of wls in the lactation diet has the potential to improve the milk fa composition of does.
digestive_health	in the present study, the results of a measurement campaign aiming to assess cancer risk among two special groups of population: policemen and laboratory technicians exposed to the toxic substances, benzene and formaldehyde are presented. the exposure is compared to general population risk. the results show that policemen working outdoor (traffic regulation, patrol on foot or in vehicles, etc.) are exposed at a significantly higher benzene concentration (3-5 times) than the general population, while the exposure to carbonyls is in general lower. the laboratory technicians appear to be highly exposed to formaldehyde while no significant variation of benzene exposure in comparison to the general population is recorded. the assessment revealed that laboratory technicians and policemen run a 20% and 1% higher cancer risk respectively compared to the general population. indoor working place air quality is more significant in assessing cancer risk in these two categories of professionals, due to the higher inhalation unit risk (iur) of formaldehyde compared to benzene. since the origin of the danger to laboratory technicians is clear (use of chemicals necessary for the experiments), in policemen the presence of carbonyls in indoor air concentrations due to smoking or used materials constitute a danger equal to the exposure to traffic originated air pollutants.
healthy_sleep	objectives: to describe sleep duration and sleep characteristics, and to examine the associations between sleep duration and characteristics and body weight status, diet quality, and physical activity levels among grade 5 children in nova scotia. methods: a provincially representative sample of 5,560 grade 5 children and their parents in nova scotia was surveyed. parents were asked to report their child 's bedtime and wake-up time, and to indicate how often their child snored or felt sleepy during the day. dietary intake and physical activity were self-reported by children using the harvard youth/adolescent food frequency questionnaire and the physical activity questionnaire for children respectively. body weight status was determined using measured heights and weights. linear and logistic random effects models with children nested within schools were used to test for associations. results: approximately half of the surveyed parents reported that their children were not getting adequate sleep at night. longer sleep duration was statistically significantly associated with decreased risk for overweight and obesity independent of other sleep characteristics (or = 0.82, 95% ci: 0.73, 0.91). longer sleep duration was also associated with better diet quality and higher levels of physical activity. conclusions: these findings indicate a need for health promotion strategies to encourage adequate sleep and to promote healthy sleep environments among children. given the links among sleep, body weight status and lifestyle behaviours, these messages should be included in public health interventions aimed at preventing obesity and promoting health among children.
healthy_sleep	objectives: current recommendations for healthy sleep in school-aged children are predominantly focused on optimal sleep duration (9-11 h). however, given the importance of routine for circadian health, the stability of sleep/wake schedules may also be important, especially for daytime behavioral functioning. we examined the relationship between short sleep duration, sleep schedule instability and behavioral difficulties in a community sample of australian children. methods: children, aged 5-10 years (n = 1622), without chronic health or psychological conditions, were recruited from primary schools in adelaide, south australia. a parent-report questionnaire was used to assess sleep/wake behavior. behavioral functioning was assessed using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire. results: most children met sleep duration recommendations with approximately 5% reporting12 h. weekly variability of bed and rise times >1 h were reported in up to 50% of children. multinomial regression analysis revealed sleep duration60 min, and bed and rise time variability >60 min significantly increased the risk of scoring in the 95th percentile for behavioral subscales. conclusions: inconsistent sleep schedules were common and, similar to short sleep duration, were associated with behavioral difficulties. considering the lack of study in this area, further research is needed for the development of new recommendations, education and sleep health messages.

healthy_sleep	under normal sleep-wake conditions, noradrenaline (na) secretions in supine subjects exhibit a weak circadian variation with a peak that occurs around noon; the sleep span is characterized by reduced na secretion. some investigators have reported that the circadian na rhythm is completely obliterated during sleep deprivation. in our laboratory, plasma na was assayed every hour for 24 h in nine healthy men 20-23 years of age. all men were deprived of sleep and were required to eat and walk around every hour to prevent sleep. however, subjects remained supine for 20 min before blood samples were collected to eliminate the effect of activity. persistence of a slight decrease in the night concentration in several subjects, despite sleep deprivation, suggests that na secretion may be influenced by a biological clock whose activity becomes visible when the influence of posture is removed.
healthy_sleep	study objectives: work-family conflict is a threat to healthy sleep behaviors among employees. this study aimed to examine how work-to-family conflict (demands from work that interfere with one 's family/personal life; wtfc) and family-to-work conflict (demands from family/personal life that interfere with work; ftwc) are associated with several dimensions of sleep among information technology workers. methods: employees at a u.s. it firm (n = 799) provided self-reports of sleep sufficiency (feeling rested upon waking), sleep quality, and sleep maintenance insomnia symptoms (waking up in the middle of the night or early morning) in the last month. they also provided a week of actigraphy for nighttime sleep duration, napping, sleep timing, and a novel sleep inconsistency measure. analyses adjusted for work conditions (job demands, decision authority, schedule control, and family-supportive supervisor behavior), and household and sociodemographic characteristics. results: employees who experienced higher wtfc reported less sleep sufficiency, poorer sleep quality, and more insomnia symptoms. higher wtfc also predicted shorter nighttime sleep duration, greater likelihood of napping, and longer nap duration. furthermore, higher wtfc was linked to greater inconsistency of nighttime sleep duration and sleep clock times, whereas higher ftwc was associated with more rigidity of sleep timing mostly driven by wake time. conclusions: results highlight the unique associations of wtfc/ftwc with employee sleep independent of other work conditions and household and sociodemographic characteristics. our novel methodological approach demonstrates differential associations of wtfc and ftwc with inconsistency of sleep timing. given the strong associations between wtfc and poor sleep, future research should focus on reducing wtfc.
healthy_sleep	objective: to test whether subjects spontaneously signal sleepiness before falling asleep under monotonous conditions. methods: twenty-eight healthy students were deprived of sleep for one night and then underwent a ""maintenance-of-wakefulness test"" (mwt) consisting of four 40-min trials. they were told to give a signal as soon as they felt sleepy and to try to stay awake as long as possible. in a first series of tests, the subjects were given no reward (nr); in a second series, monetary rewards (wr) were given both for an accurate perception of sleepiness and for staying awake longer. results: seventeen of the 28 subjects (60.7%) did not signal sleepiness before a sleep fragment occurred in at least one of the four mwt trials. women were more reliably aware of sleepiness than men in the nr trials (p = .02), while the men 's performance improved in the wr trials (p < .02), becoming equivalent to the women 's performance. conclusions: our results cast doubt on the general assumption that one cannot fall asleep without feeling sleepy first. if similar results can be obtained in monotonous driving or working situations, this will imply that accidents caused by sleepiness or by falling asleep cannot necessarily be attributed to an individual 's negligence.

anxiety	studies on the diurnal sleep-wake rhythm of patients with lung cancer have mostly examined patients cross-sectionally, whereas the effects of lung cancer treatment over time have rarely been considered. through long-term longitudinal tracking of patients with lung cancer, this study examined changes in their sleep-wake rhythm, sleep quality, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue and quality of life (qol) at various treatment stages. in addition, factors affecting their qol were explored. hierarchical linear modeling was adopted to analyze a convenience sample of 82 patients with lung cancer. the changes in their sleep-wake rhythm, sleep, mood (anxiety, depressive symptoms and fatigue) and qol were observed at five time points: prior to treatment and at weeks 6, 12, 24 and 48 after the start of the treatment. the effects of sex, age, cancer stage, treatment type, comorbidities and time were controlled to determine the predictors of patients' qol. the results showed that patients' sleep-wake rhythms were poor before treatments. compared with baseline, the sleep-wake rhythms of the patients significantly improved at week 48, and anxiety significantly improved at weeks 6, 12, 24 and 48. by contrast, their fatigue became exacerbated at weeks 8 and 48. moreover, qol improved significantly from week 6 until the end of the treatment period. qol was negatively affected by poor sleep quality (beta = -0.69, p = 0.00) and depressive symptoms (beta = -2.59, p < 0.001) and positively affected by regular sleep-wake rhythms (beta = 0.23, p = 0.001). therefore, clinical health-care professionals should focus more attention to the fatigue levels of patients with lung cancer before, during and after treatment. health-care professionals may also need to provide such patients with health education regarding sleep hygiene and with emotional support to assist them in maintaining regular sleep-wake rhythms in order to improve their qol.
anxiety	objective: psychiatric symptoms of varying degrees that accompany hyperemesis gravidarum (hg) may continue throughout the pregnancy or after, and these psychological problems may cause morbidity. in this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the hg and psychiatric symptoms in the first trimester and postpartum depression. methods: two hundred and seven pregnant who were diagnosed as hg and 177 healthy pregnant women included in this prospective study. all cases were assessed with scl-90-r in first trimester and with ed in postpartum period. factors related to postpartum psychiatric symptoms were investigated with bivariate logistic regression analysis. results: scl-90-r and ed scores were statistically significant at hg group (p<0.05). in cases who diagnosed as postpartum depression, the rates of hg and scl-90-r results were higher (p<0.05). in the bivariate analysis, the high rates of hg and high scl-90-r scores were determined to be related to postpartum depression (p<0.05). conclusions: the results show that mental health is negatively affected by hg at pregnancy, and in this case, psychiatric symptoms may continue even after discontinuation hg.
anxiety	backgroundtemporal discounting refers to the tendency for rewards to lose value as the expected delay to receipt increases. individuals with anorexia nervosa (an) have been found to show reduced temporal discounting rates, indicating a greater preference for delayed rewards compared to healthy peers. obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) and social anxiety disorder (sad) commonly co-occur with an, and anxiety has been related to development and prognosis of an. we examined whether reduced temporal discounting is present across these potentially related disorders, and explored the relationship between temporal discounting and anxiety transdiagnostically. methodsone hundred ninety six individuals (75 healthy controls (hc); 50 ocd; 27 an; 44 sad) completed two temporal discounting tasks in which they chose between smaller-sooner and larger-later monetary rewards. two measures of discountingdiscount rate and discount factorwere compared between diagnostic groups, and associations with anxious traits were examined. resultsindividuals with an showed decreased temporal discounting compared to hc. ocd and sad groups did not differ significantly from hc. across the sample, anxiety was associated with decreased discounting; more anxious individuals showed a greater preference for delayed reward. conclusionswe replicated the findings that individuals with an show an increased preference for delayed reward relative to hc and that individuals with ocd do not differ from hc. we also showed that individuals with sad do not differ from hc in discounting. across this large sample, two measures of anxious temperament were associated with temporal discounting. these data raise new questions about the relationship between this dimensional trait and psychopathology.
anxiety	erectile dysfunction (ed) and premature ejaculation (pe) are two forms of male sexual disorder with both psychological and physical features. while their cognitive, attentional, and affective components have been investigated separately, there is a lack of knowledge about the role played by cognitive attentional syndrome in their onset and maintenance. the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible contribution of perseverative thinking styles and thought control strategies to the development and maintenance of ed and pe. the authors hypothesized that such modes of processing might constitute a cognitive attentional syndrome specific to these disorders and sustained by particular metacognitive beliefs. a semistructured interview was administered to 11 participants with ed and 10 with pe in order to assess their metacognitive beliefs and cognitive attentional processes. the results suggest that individuals with ed and pe adopt a range of cognitive attentional strategies aimed at improving their sexual performance, and endorse both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs about these thinking responses. overall, their cognitive and attentional patterns worsened negative internal states, reduced sexual excitement, detached them from their bodily sensations, and hindered sexual functioning. these preliminary findings suggest that perseverative thinking, thought control strategies, and metacognitive beliefs may play a key role in the onset and maintenance of male sexual dysfunction.
anxiety	this study attempted to examine the validity of the italian version of the career factors inventory (cfi), a psychometric tool widely used in the assessment of cognitive and personal-emotional dimensions of career indecision, among a sample of 2,060 italian students attending high school and university. recurring to both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, the original four-factor structure was confirmed and returned, in line with the literature, satisfactory reliability indices; moreover, cfi subscales showed intercorrelations consistent with previous studies, albeit lower in some cases. subsequently, convergent validity between the four cfi subscales and other scales via zero-order correlation was tested, confirming previous evidence except for need for career information. in conclusion, consistent with previous studies, the italian version of the cfi showed to be a valid and reliable instrument for the evaluation of dimensions of career indecision.
psoriasis	psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated skin disease. antagonists of tnf-alpha and, recently, il-17 have proven to be highly effective in the treatment for psoriasis; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis are poorly understood. recently, we presented evidence that i kappa b zeta is a key regulator in the development of psoriasis through its role in mediating il-17a-driven effects. like il-17a, il-17f is produced by a variety of immune cells, and the expression of il-17f is increased in psoriatic skin. the purpose of this study was to characterize the role of il-17f in the regulation of i kappa b zeta expression and to investigate whether il-17f regulates psoriasis-associated genes in human keratinocytes through i kappa b zeta. here, we demonstrate that il-17f stimulation induces i kappa b zeta expression at both the mrna and the protein levels in normal human keratinocytes. moreover, silencing i kappa b zeta by sirna revealed that i kappa b zeta is a key regulator of specific il-17f-inducible psoriasis-associated genes and proteins, including defb4/hbd2, s100a7, ccl20, il-8 and chi3l1. in addition, il-17f-induced i kappa b zeta expression is mediated by a mechanism involving the p38 mapk and nf-kappa b signalling pathways, as shown by the clear reduction in il-17f-mediated expression of i kappa b zeta during chemical inhibition of these two signalling pathways. in summary, we present i kappa b zeta as a novel key regulator of il-17f-driven effects in psoriasis. thus, antagonists to i kappa b zeta could potentially provide a more targeted approach for treating psoriasis as well as for treating the other inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases for which il-17-targeting drugs have recently been approved.
psoriasis	background: psoriasis is associated with numerous comorbidities, often reported in terms of relative risk. both doctors and the general population tend to overestimate the effects of exposures when presented in relative terms, leading to anxiety and potentially poor treatment decisions. absolute risks might provide a better basis for risk assessment. objective: to characterize and compare relative and absolute risks of comorbidities in patients with psoriasis. methods: a systematic review using medline identified comorbidities associated with psoriasis, their relative risks, and information for calculating absolute risks. results: the comorbidities associated with psoriasis with the highest relative risk were nonmelanoma skin cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma, with relative risks of 7.5, 6.12, and 3.61, respectively; the attributable risk for these 3 conditions were 0.64, 0.05, and 0.17 per 1000 person-years, respectively. to attribute 1 event of these conditions to psoriasis would require seeing 1551; 20,135; and 5823 patients, respectively. limitations: database studies might not fully account for confounders, resulting in overestimates of the risk impact of comorbidities. conclusions: presenting attributable risk in the form of the number needed to harm provides a clearer picture of the magnitude of risk and a basis for wiser medical decision making and patient education.
psoriasis	psoriasis is resistant to treatment and it shows frequent relapse; systemic treatment is often associated with toxicities, and long-term safety data are lacking for most of the newer drugs like biologics. moreover, some body areas such as hands, feet, intertriginous areas, scalp, and nails are even more resistant. frequently, systemic treatments are necessary considering the higher psychological impact on the patient. there is a lack of agreement on the best therapeutic modalities in the management of psoriasis involving difficult-to-treat locations. at present, there are no indian guidelines for these conditions. available literature has been reviewed extensively on the treatment of psoriasis involving difficult-to-treat locations; level of evidence has been evaluated as per the oxford centre for evidence-based medicine 2011 guideline, and therapeutic suggestions have been developed. best care has been employed to consider socioeconomic, cultural, genetic, and ethnic factors to prepare a therapeutic suggestion that is appropriate and logical to be used among indian population and people of similar ethnic and socioeconomic background.
psoriasis	overweight is a proposed risk factor for psoriasis. how-ever, evidence from prospective studies is limited. the aim of this study was to investigate the association be-tween overweight, weight gain and risk of psoriasis, and potential synergism with smoking, within a population-based cohort including 8,752 individuals followed from 1994 up to 2008. there was a 32% increased odds of psoriasis from a body mass index (bmi) of 27 kg/m(2), in multi-variable logistic regression analysis, further increasing to 43% at bmi 28 kg/m(2), and to 71% at bmi >= 30 kg/m(2) in non-smokers. there was a dose-response association between weight gain from age 25 years, with up to 90% higher odds of psoriasis from middle age, independent of weight category. there was no indication of a synergism between overweight and smoking, and no interaction with sex. overweight and weight gain represent modifiable risk factors that may be targets for primary prevention of psoriasis.
psoriasis	objective: psoriasis has been considered as systemic disorder. lipocalin-2 might be a link between psoriasis and its comorbidities. aim of the study was to investigate the associations between serum lipocalin-2 levels and the disease activity, markers of inflammation or metabolic disturbances and changes after topical treatment in psoriatic patients. methods: thirty-seven individuals with active plaque-type psoriasis and 15 healthy controls were recruited. blood samples were collected before and after 14 days of therapy. serum lipocalin-2 concentrations were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the results were correlated with psoriasis area and severity index (pasi), body mass index (bmi), inflammatory and biochemical markers, lipid profile and with effectiveness of topical treatment. results: lipocalin-2 serum levels were significantly increased in psoriatic patients in comparison to the controls (p=0.023). no significant correlations with indicators of inflammation, nor bmi or pasi were noted. a statistical association between lipocalin-2 and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was shown. after topical treatment serum lipocalin-2 level did not significantly change (p=0.9), still remaining higher than in the controls, despite clinical improvement. conclusions: lipocalin-2 might be a marker of psoriasis and convey cardiovascular or metabolic risk in psoriatic patients, but may not be a reliable indicator of inflammation, severity of psoriasis nor efficacy of antipsoriatic treatment.
ankylosing_spondylitis	involvement of tendons and tendon sheaths is frequently found in the most common inflammatory systemic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. in rheumatoid arthritis tendon manifestations occur as tenosynovitis, with swelling and pain of the tendons mainly on the hands and feet. in spondyloarthritis the involvement of tendons presents as enthesitis with pain and swelling directly at the attachment points of tendons to the bony structures and more commonly in the lower extremities. pathological alterations of tendons can be normally visualized by sonography and only sometimes with magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or scintigraphy. furthermore, it is important for diagnostics and effective therapy to detect all joints involved by means of clinical, sonographic and radiological examination as well as laboratory parameters of inflammation, antibody serology (e.g. anti-ccp antibodies) and hla-b27. the histopathological alterations of tendinopathy in rheumatic diseases differ from degenerative/posttraumatic tendinopathy in their expression of the changes; however, a clear differentiation of the different rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases is histopathologically not possible. therapeutically, systemic medication is the most important part of treatment in rheumatic diseases. local therapeutic measures can be employed in the treatment of tenosynovitis and enthesitis. in the case of failure or lack of efficacy of the medication and conservative therapy, tenosynovectomy is performed for persistent tenosynovitis and reconstructive surgical procedures are necessary for tendon ruptures.
ankylosing_spondylitis	functional limitation is often complained by patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as). with a rising number of patients suffering from as, there are a limited number of reports focusing on functional limitation of as in chinese patients. this study was conducted to investigate the level of functional limitation and explore its associations with demographic, disease-related factors. a total of 303 as outpatients were recruited in this cross-sectional study from a tertiary general hospital in southwest china. functional limitation was measured by the bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (basfi). other data were collected by the following questionnaires: the bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai), the bath ankylosing spondylitis patient global score (bas-g), and the pittsburgh sleep quality index questionnaire (psqi). finally, 295 outpatients with as completed this survey. the median basfi was 0.80. worse function limitation was found in outpatients with extra-spinal manifestation, older age, lower household income, more back pain, higher disease activity and morning stiffness, poorer sleep, and worse patient 's well-being (all p < 0.05). multivariate regression analysis indicated that patient 's well-being (p < 0.001), disease activity (p < 0.001), and disease duration (p < 0.05) were the positive predictors of functional limitation. as outpatients in southwest china had a mild level of functional limitation. the factors associated with functional limitation included disease duration, disease activity, and patients' well-being, which should be taken into consideration when assessing functional limitation of as outpatients. besides, more comprehensive and targeted interventions should be conducted for as patients as early as possible, which will be effective to improve functional outcome.
ankylosing_spondylitis	the aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of power doppler ultrasound (pdus) abnormalities at entheseal sites in patients with early psoriatic arthritis (psa) na < ve to traditional and biologic dmards and to compare the pdus findings with clinical examination. psa patients with early disease and na < ve to traditional and biologic dmards were consecutively enrolled in this study. patients underwent pdus examination of the following bilateral entheseal sites: common extensor tendon at its insertion at the lateral humeral epicondyle; quadriceps tendon at its insertion at the superior pole of the patella; patellar tendon at its insertion at the tibial tuberosity; medial collateral ligament at its proximal insertion and achilles tendon at its insertion at the calcaneus. the leeds enthesitis index (lei) was used to assess clinical entheseal involvement. twenty-one early psa patients completed the clinical and pdus examinations. clinical entheseal involvement was found in 9 (42.9 %) and pdus abnormalities in 20 (95.5 %) of the 21 early psa patients. achilles tendon insertion was the site with the major entheseal abnormalities. active (power doppler positive) entheseal lesions were found in 4.7, 9.5, 14.3 and 14.3 % of patients at the lateral humeral epicondyle; quadriceps tendon, patellar tendon insertions, and achilles tendon insertions, respectively. concordance between clinical (lei) and pdus was poor. the present study confirms that pdus allows detecting structural and inflammatory abnormalities of enthesis in early psa patients. our study shows that, in early disease, active abnormalities seem to have a low prevalence.
ankylosing_spondylitis	a new three-dimensional (3-d) zn-based metal-organic framework with the formula of [zn-2(l)(bpy)](ci) (1, h3l = 2,6-dihydroxypyridine-4-carboxylate, bpy = 4,4'-bipyridine), has been synthesized under hydrothermal condition. x-ray diffraction analyse reveals that compound 1 exhibits the unique 3-d two-fold interpenetrated coordination framework with 3,4-connected fsx-3,4-c2 network topology, in which the l ligand adopts the mu(3)-bridging fashion. in addition, the experimental results of anti-inflammatory activity showed that compared with organic ligands h3l and bpy, the title compound 1 exerted rather potent activity.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective. to determine the reproducibility of evaluation of sacroiliac joint (sij) radiographs among readers with varying levels of experience, and to identify potential drivers of disagreement in classification among 5 predefined radiographic lesion types. methods. the study sample consisted of 104 consecutive patients aged 18-40 with low back pain >= 3 months of duration who met the assessment of spondyloarthritis international society (asas) definition for a positive sij magnetic resonance image, or were hla-b27-positive and had >= 1 spondyloarthritis (spa)-related clinical/laboratory feature according to the asas classification criteria for axial spa. seven blinded readers (2 musculoskeletal radiologists, 5 rheumatologists) classified pelvic radiographs according to the modified new york criteria (mny) and recorded presence/absence of 5 lesion types in both sij: erosion, sclerosis, ankylosis, joint space widening, and joint space narrowing. reproducibility of mny classification among 21 reader pairs was assessed and potential drivers of disagreement were identified among 5 lesion types. a generalized linear mixed logistic regression model served to analyze to what extent discordance in lesion type was associated with discrepant mny classification. results. mean kappa values (percent concordance) were 0.39 (84.1%) for mny classification over 21 reader pairs, 0.46 (79.8%) between 2 musculoskeletal radiologists, and 0.55 (86.5%) and 0.36 (77.9%) between the most experienced rheumatologist and the 2 radiologists. erosion showed the lowest agreement (25%) among patients with discordant classification and gave the highest or of 13.5 for disagreement. conclusion. reproducibility of radiographic sij classification in an spa inception cohort was only fair to at best moderate among 7 readers with varying levels of experience, questioning the applicability of mny in early spa.
children's_health	regulated school days entail less free-living physical activity (pa) and outdoor stay, which may jeopardize the opportunities for cohesive moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (mvpa) and, by extension, children 's health. the role of outdoor stay during school time for pupils' free-living pa vs. physical education (pe) and indoor stay was studied during one academic year in 196 pupils aged 7-14 years at four schools in mid-southern sweden during five consecutive days each in september, march, and may. actigraph gt3x+ activity monitors were used. predictors for pa during school stay were expressed as mean daily accelerometer counts and were measured per season, day, grade, gender, weather, and time outdoors. overall, free-living pa outdoors generated the highest mean accelerometer counts for moderate and vigorous pa. outdoor pa and pe, representing 23.7% of the total school time contributed to 50.4% of total mean accelerometer counts, and were the greatest contributors to moderate and vigorous pa. age and weather impacted pa, with less pa in inclement weather and among older pupils. more time outdoors, at all seasons, would favorably increase school children 's chances of reaching recommended levels of pa.
children's_health	objectives/hypothesis: to determine whether parent-perceived hearing problems are associated with grade repetition among children in the united states. study design: retrospective cohort analysis of a contemporary national database. methods: the national survey of children 's health 2011 to 2012 was analyzed. hearing loss, as perceived and reported by parents, was categorized as: no hearing problem, history of a hearing problem, or current hearing problem. children never repeating a grade versus repeating one or more grades (kindergarten-high school) were identified. univariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyzed the association of hearing problems with grade repetition. patients with mental retardation, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were excluded from the analysis. after adjusting for race, sex, and poverty level, odds ratios for grade repetition were computed. results: among 66.1 million (average age, 8.3 years, 49.0% male) children, 97.3% never had a hearing problem, 1.7% had a history of a hearing problem, and 1.0% had a current hearing problem. overall, 7.1% repeated a grade. grade repetition was reported in 6.9% of children without a hearing problem versus 9.4% with a history of a hearing problem and 19.3% with a current hearing problem (p < 0.001). after adjustment for race, poverty level, and sex, a history of a hearing problem demonstrated an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval 0.82-4.13) for grade repetition, whereas a current hearing problem demonstrated an odds ratio of 3.0 (1.90-4.80). conclusion: parents' perception of children 's hearing problems is strongly associated with grade repetition. this trend is noticed in elementary school more than in high school.
children's_health	objectives: to examine parent report of flourishing in children with hearing impairments compared to children without hearing impairments, and to explore whether school engagement and bullying related to child flourishing. methods: participants were 655 children with hearing impairments and 44, 618 children without hearing impairments who were 10-17 years of age. caregivers completed telephone interviews about their child 's functioning for the national survey of children 's health. results: children without hearing loss had higher parent-reported flourishing compared to children with hearing loss when controlling for child demographics (i.e., race, age, sex). school engagement was positively related to flourishing of children with hearing loss. bullying behaviors were not related to flourishing of children with hearing loss. conclusion: improving school engagement may increase flourishing of children with hearing loss, which is critical given that children with hearing loss experience lower flourishing than children without hearing loss. examining the relationships among other risk and resilience factors and flourishing for children with hearing loss will provide information for interventions to enhance the adaptation of these children.

children's_health	document beliefs about the contribution of physical activity to preschool-aged children 's health held by latino mothers in farmworker families, and delineate their perceived barriers or constraints that impose limits on preschool-aged children 's physical activity. qualitative data obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews (n = 33) with mothers of preschool-aged children living in latino farmworker families in north carolina. mothers universally agree that regular vigorous physical activity is good for preschool-aged children 's health, including obesity prevention. however, excessive physical activity can produce illnesses, as well as other physical and emotional problems, and should be limited. mothers wanted their children to engage in more sedentary forms of activity because they believed it would benefit learning. physical and chemical hazards in rural environments, distance to parks and play spaces, and lack of familiarity and concerns about neighbors constrained children 's physical activity. although physical activity is believed to be beneficial, strong cultural beliefs and real contextual barriers undermine preschool-aged latino farmworker children 's level of physical activity.
children's_health	di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (dehp) is one of the most widely used phthalates. metabolites of dehp are detectable in majority of the population. findings on adverse health outcomes, particularly birth weight in association with prenatal exposure to dehp remain equivocal. besides, there is insufficient evidence to address influence on metabolic function from epidemiological studies. thus, our objective was to investigate cord blood adipokine levels and birth size in association with prenatal dehp exposure in prospective birth cohort study. mono-2-methylhexyl phthalate (mehp), primary metabolite of dehp was determined as exposure by using maternal blood sample of 3rd trimester. leptin and adiponectin levels in cord blood were measured as markers of metabolic function. birth weight and length were obtained from birth record. association between maternal mehp levels and cord blood adiponectin and leptin levels, birth weight and ponderal index (pi) were examined for 167 mother-child pairs who had both mehp and cord blood adipokine measurements. the median mehp level was 8.81 ng/ml and the detection rate was 100%. there was no sex difference in mehp levels. both leptin and adiponectin levels were higher in girls than in boys. mehp level was positively associated with adiponectin level among boys and was negatively associated with leptin level among girls. mehp level were negatively associated with pi only in girls and this could be due to decreased leptin level. this study suggested that prenatal dehp exposure may be associated with cord blood adipokine and birth size. the influence potentially be sex-specific and could be more significant in girls.

stress_management	purpose: the purpose of this study was to gather baseline data on the health-promoting lifestyle practices of rns working in six major health care and educational institutions in a southeast pennsylvania community. methods: a descriptive correlational study design was used. the 52-item health-promoting lifestyle profile ii instrument was used to explore participants' self-reported health-promoting behaviors and measure the dimensions of health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, interpersonal relations, spiritual growth, and stress management. results: findings revealed that physical activity and stress management scores were low for the entire group of rns. there were statistically significant differences between nurses 50 years of age and older and those 30 to 39 years of age for the subscales of health responsibility, nutrition, and stress management, suggesting that older nurses are more concerned about their health. there were also statistically significant differences between nurses 50 years of age and older and those 29 years of age and younger for the subscale of health responsibility. sixty-seven percent of participants reported having too many competing priorities and had significantly lower subscale scores for spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management, as well as significantly lower total scores. conclusion: this study 's findings provided baseline data that will be useful in planning health-promoting lifestyle interventions for participants specific to their institutions, and may help guide future research and educational initiatives related to numerous issues common to the rn workforce. the failure of many nurses to take adequate care of themselves needs to be better understood and addressed, by both individual nurses and their employers.
stress_management	the development of supervisors' behaviours has been proposed as an innovative approach for the reduction of employees' work stress. the uk health and safety executive (hse) developed the ""stress management competency indicator tool"" (smcit), designed to be used within a learning and development intervention. however, its psychometric properties have never been evaluated, and the length of the questionnaire (66 items) limits its practical applicability. we developed a brief 36-item version of the questionnaire, assessed its psychometric properties and studied the relationship with the employees' psychosocial work environment. 353 employees filled in the brief smcit and the ""stress management indicator tool"". the latter is a self-report questionnaire developed by the uk hse, measuring workers' perceptions of seven dimensions of the psychosocial work environment that if not properly managed can lead to harm. data were analysed with structural equation modelling and multiple regressions. the results confirmed the factorial structure of the brief smcit questionnaire and mainly supported the convergent validity and internal consistency of the scales. furthermore, with few exceptions, the relations hypothesized between supervisors' competencies and the psychosocial work environment were confirmed, supporting the criterion validity of the revised questionnaire and the uk hse framework. we conclude that the brief 36-item version of the smcit represents an important step toward the development of interventions directed at supervisors and we discuss the practical implications for work stress prevention.
stress_management	introduction: occupational stress is a major factor in hindering the performance of nurses and midwives and developing physical and mental complications in them. given that these two groups are in direct contact with patients more than other medical staff and stress management training can be effective in the reduction of occupational stress among the nurses and midwives. aim: this study was set out to compare the effect of a precede-proceed based stress management training program on the occupational stress of the nurses and midwives. materials and methods: this quasi-experimental study was conducted on the aforementioned nurses and midwives. data collection instruments included the nursing stress scale (nss). the training program was held in two 4-hour-long sessions for three months from 1st january to 31st march 2013. results: the results showed a significant increase in the precede scores of both groups by the end of the program, as compared to the baseline. a significant decrease was also observed in the stress scores of both groups. there was no difference between groups in these regards. conclusion: the precede-based stress management training is effective in the reduction of occupational stress among the nurses and midwives.
stress_management	research on the efficacy of yoga for improving mental, emotional, physical, and behavioral health characteristics in school settings is a recent but growing field of inquiry. this systematic review of research on school-based yoga interventions published in peer-reviewed journals offers a bibliometric analysis that identified 47 publications. the studies from these publications have been conducted primarily in the united states (n = 30) and india (n = 15) since 2005, with the majority of studies (n = 41) conducted from 2010 onward. about half of the publications were of studies at elementary schools; most (85%) were conducted within the school curriculum, and most (62%) also implemented a formal school-based yoga program. there was a high degree of variability in yoga intervention characteristics, including overall duration, and the number and duration of sessions. most of these published research trials are preliminary in nature, with numerous study design limitations, including limited sample sizes (median = 74; range = 20-660) and relatively weak research designs (57% randomized controlled trials, 19% uncontrolled trials), as would be expected in an infant research field. nevertheless, these publications suggest that yoga in the school setting is a viable and potentially efficacious strategy for improving child and adolescent health and therefore worthy of continued research.
stress_management	employees with low levels of work-related self-efficacy may stand to benefit more from a worksite stress management training (smt) intervention. however, this low work-related self-efficacy/enhanced smt benefits effect may be conditional on employees also having high levels of intrinsic work motivation. in the present study, we examined this proposition by testing three-way, or higher order, interaction effects. one hundred and fifty-three u.k. government employees were randomly assigned to a smt intervention group (n = 68), or to a waiting list control group (n = 85). the smt group received three half-day training sessions spread over two and a half months. findings indicated that there were significant overall reductions in psychological strain, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in the smt group, in comparison to the control group. furthermore, there were significant higher order group (smt vs. control) x time 1 work-related self-efficacy x time 1 intrinsic work motivation interactions, such that reductions in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization at certain time points were experienced only by those who had low baseline levels of work-related self-efficacy and high baseline levels of intrinsic work motivation. implications for work-related self-efficacy theory and research and smt research and practice are discussed.
hiv_aids	changes in retrovirus acquisition/transmission behaviors have been reported in brazil, with a concerning increase in hiv-1-infected individuals aged 15-39 years. in sao paulo, hiv-1/htlv-1 and hiv-1/htlv-2 coinfections have been associated with intravenous drug use and failure to detect htlv-1/2 (human t cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2) with immunosuppression and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). negative results for htlv serologic [western blotting (wb)] and molecular [real-time pcr pol (qpcr)] confirmatory assays have been reported, whereas the best sensitivity has been found for inno-lia (lia). in this study, we expand our previous data by analyzing a group of young patients (n = 1,383; median age 35.6 years) who recently acquired hiv by sexual contact, the majority of whom were haart naive, and comparing the performances of four htlv confirmatory assays: lia, wb, qpcr, and pcr-rflp (tax). we confirmed htlv infection in 58 (4.2%) blood samples: 29 htlv-1, 24 htlv-2, 1 htlv-1+htlv-2, and 4 htlv. lia, wb, qpcr, and pcr-rflp sensitivities were 94.8%, 82.8%, 79.2%, and 74.5%, respectively. associations of htlv infection with female gender (or = 2.28, 1.31-4.00) and age >40 years (p < .0001) were detected. the results confirm the low sensitivities of molecular assays and the best performance of lia in detecting htlv-1/2 in such patients. we hypothesize that the negative pcr results are due to the presence of defective provirus and/or low proviral load circulating in such patients, with inconclusive wb coinciding with the seroconversion period. corroborating the associations obtained, repeated exposure is required for htlv sexual transmission/acquisition, which is more efficient from male to female.
hiv_aids	purpose of reviewmore point-of-care (poc) diagnostic tests are becoming available for hiv diagnosis and treatment in resource-limited settings. these novel technologies have the potential to foster decentralized hiv care and treatment for the benefit of clinical laboratories, hiv clinics, and hiv-infected patients. there continue to be many business, technological, and operational challenges that limit product development and regulatory approval, which limits products available for the required operational and cost-effectiveness studies and delays policy adoption and implementation.recent findingsalthough the rapid hiv diagnostic test has been widely successful, the pathways for poc cd4(+) cell count and hiv viral load assay analyzers have been more challenging. we describe significant hurdles for product development, approval, and implementation, which include the business case, technical development, clinical impact, and integrating laboratory and clinical networks.summarythe objective of this review is to highlight the obstacles for developing and implementing appropriate strategies for poc hiv testing assays to improve the clinical services for hiv-infected patients in resource-limited settings.
hiv_aids	hiv-positive kenyan men who have sex with men (msm) are a highly stigmatized group facing barriers to care engagement and antiretroviral therapy (art) adherence. because care providers' views are important in improving outcomes, we sought the perspective of those serving msm patients on how to optimize art adherence in a setting where same-sex behavior is criminalized. we conducted 4 focus group discussions with a total of 29 healthcare workers (hcws) experienced in providing hiv care to msm. the semistructured, open-ended topic guide used was based on an access-information-motivation-proximal cues model of adherence, with added focus on trust in providers, stigma, and discrimination. detailed facilitator notes and transcripts were translated into english and reviewed for common themes. the hcw identified adherence challenges of msm patients that are similar to those of the general population, including hiv-related stigma and lack of disclosure. in addition, hcws noted challenges specific to msm, such as lack of access to msm-friendly health services, economic and social challenges due to stigma, difficult relationships with care providers, and discrimination at the clinic and in the community. hcws recommended clinic staff sensitivity training, use of trained msm peer navigators, and stigma reduction in the community as interventions that might improve adherence and health outcomes for msm. despite noting msm-specific barriers, hcws recommended strategies for improving hiv care for msm in rights-constrained settings that merit future research attention. most likely, multilevel interventions incorporating both individual and structural factors will be necessary.
hiv_aids	purpose: the purpose of this study is to estimate the population size of men who have sex with men (msm) in kazakhstan and their hiv testing history. methods: we conducted structured interviews with msm in four geographically disparate cities-n=400 (n = 100/city)-to implement four population estimation methods and ascertain hiv testing history. results: approximately 3.2% of men-corresponding to similar to 154,000 individuals-in kazakhstan aged 18-59 are msm. the 49.9% of the sample who reported taking an hiv test far exceeds the <1% reported as msm in surveillance data. conclusion: hiv testing surveillance in kazakhstan has underestimated the number of msm. this underscores the need to redress social and structural barriers to hiv testing and disclosure of sexual behavior experienced by msm in kazakhstan. recommendations include promoting cultural sensitivity among testing staff through quality assurance and regular training, and increasing protection and public awareness through antidiscrimination policy development.
hiv_aids	caring for hiv/aids patients and/or drug users requires health care workers (hcws) to have good knowledge of the issues. cultural differences in hcws, combined with professional ethics and personal beliefs, could also result in conflicting attitudes, leading to difficulties related to looking after people affected by hiv/aids or drug users. a cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the attitude towards hiv/aids patients and/or drug users in a sample of workers operating in a large university hospital in southern italy. a total of 736 workers were surveyed from may to november 2016. during the periodic occupational health surveillance, a questionnaire was administered about attitudes of discrimination, acceptance and fear towards these patients. respondents showed average levels of acceptance to hiv/aids and drug user patients. as years of experience and professional training increased, scores for discrimination, acceptance of hiv/aids, acceptance of drug users and fear decreased. factors positively influencing levels of attitudes were being female and younger. supplementary education is needed to strengthen the awareness of hcws.
migraine	background and purpose spreading depolarizations (sds) may contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah). we tested whether sd-inhibitor valproate reduces brain injury in an sah rat model with and without experimental sd induction. methods rats were randomized in a 2x2 design and pretreated with valproate (200 mg/kg) or vehicle for 4 weeks. sah was induced by endovascular puncture of the right internal carotid bifurcation. one day post-sah, brain tissue damage was measured with t-2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, followed by cortical application of 1 mol/l kcl (to induce sds) or nacl (no sds). magnetic resonance imaging was repeated on day 3 followed by histology to confirm neuronal death. neurological function was measured with an inclined slope test. results in the groups with kcl application, lesion growth between days 1 and 3 was 5773 mm3 in the valproate-treated versus 237 +/- 232 mm3 in the vehicle-treated group. in the groups without sd induction, lesion growth in the valproate- and vehicle-treated groups was 8 +/- 20 mm3 versus 27 +/- 52 mm3. on fitting a 2-way analysis of variance model, we found a significant interaction effect between treatment and kcl/nacl application of 161 mm3 (p=0.04). number and duration of sds, mortality, and neurological function were not statistically significantly different between groups. lesion growth on magnetic resonance imaging correlated to histological infarct volume (spearman 's rho =0.83; p=0.0004), with areas of lesion growth exhibiting reduced neuronal death compared with primary lesions. conclusions in our rat sah model, valproate treatment significantly reduced brain lesion growth after kcl application. future studies are needed to confirm that this protective effect is based on sd inhibition.
migraine	background: patients with medication-overuse headache suffer not only from chronic headache, but often from psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. the mechanisms underlying these comorbidities are unclear, but the amygdala is likely to be involved in their pathogenesis. to investigate the mechanisms underlying the comorbidities we used elevated plus maze and open field tests to assess anxiety-like behavior in rats chronically treated with analgesics. we measured the electrical properties of neurons in the amygdala, and examined the cortical spreading depression (csd)-evoked expression of fos in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (tnc) and amygdala of rats chronically treated with analgesics. csd, an analog of aura, evokes fos expression in the tnc of rodents suggesting trigeminal nociception, considered to be a model of migraine. results: increased anxiety-like behavior was seen both in elevated plus maze and open field tests in a model of medication overuse produced in male rats by chronic treatment with aspirin or acetaminophen. the time spent in the open arms of the maze by aspirin-or acetaminophen-treated rats (53 +/- 36.1 and 37 +/- 29.5 s, respectively) was significantly shorter than that spent by saline-treated vehicle control rats (138 +/- 22.6 s, p < 0.001). chronic treatment with the analgesics increased the excitability of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala as indicated by their more negative threshold for action potential generation (-54.6 +/- 5.01 mv for aspirin-treated, -55.2 +/- 0.97 mv for acetaminophen-treated, and -31.50 +/- 5.34 mv for saline-treated rats, p < 0.001). chronic treatment with analgesics increased the csd-evoked expression of fos in the tnc and amygdala [18 +/- 10.2 fos-immunoreactive (ir) neurons per slide in the amygdala of rats treated with aspirin, 11 +/- 5.4 ir neurons per slide in rats treated with acetaminophen, and 4 +/- 3.7 ir neurons per slide in saline-treated control rats, p < 0.001]. conclusions: chronic treatment with analgesics can increase the excitability of neurons in the amygdala, which could underlie the anxiety seen in patients with medication-overuse headache.
migraine	intervention strategies in familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) patients and other high-risk colorectal cancer (crc) populations have highlighted a critical need for endoscopy combined with safe and effective preventive agents. we performed transcriptome profiling of colorectal adenomas from fap patients and the polyposis in rat colon (pirc) preclinical model, and prioritized molecular targets for prevention studies in vivo. at clinically relevant doses in the pirc model, the drug clotam (tolfenamic acid, ta) was highly effective at suppressing tumorigenesis both in the colon and in the small intestine, when administered alone or in combination with sulindac. cell proliferation in the colonic crypts was reduced significantly by ta, coincident with increased cleaved caspase-3 and decreased survivin, beta-catenin, cyclin d1 and matrix metalloproteinase 7. from the list of differentially expressed genes prioritized by transcriptome profiling, mmp7, s100a9, nppb and aldh1a3 were defined as key oncogene candidates downregulated in colon tumors after ta treatment. monthly colonoscopies revealed the rapid onset of tumor suppression by ta in the pirc model, and the temporal changes in mmp7, s100a9, nppb and aldh1a3, highlighting their value as potential early biomarkers for prevention in the clinical setting. we conclude that ta, an ""old drug"" repurposed from migraine, offers an exciting new therapeutic avenue in fap and other high-risk crc patient populations.
migraine	background: while studies have demonstrated the economic burden of migraines in terms of quality of life, health care resource use (hru), and costs, there exists a notable paucity of data comparing such outcomes among migraineurs with nausea and vomiting (n/v) and those without. the current study aimed to address this gap. methods: this was a retrospective study using data from the 2013 us national health and wellness survey, a cross-sectional, internet-based survey. respondents self-reported their migraine with or without n/v along with demographics and outcomes including depression (patient health questionnaire total score; phq-9), sleep problems (11-item total score of sleep problems), hru (number of physician visits, emergency room [er] visits, and hospitalizations) and work productivity and activity impairment-general health scale (wpai-gh), and associated mean annual costs. generalized linear models, adjusting for covariates, assessed the burden of n/v on all outcomes. results: among all migraineurs (n=7,855), 73.4% were female, mean age was 41.82 years old, and 57.6% reported experiencing n/v. adjusting for covariates, migraineurs with n/v vs without n/v had higher mean phq-9 scores (7.91 vs 7.02, p<0.001) and mean sleep problems (3.29 vs 2.64, p<0.001). mean er visits were more frequent among migraineurs with n/v than those without n/v (0.48 vs 0.38, p=0.001). this difference translated into a 26.3% increase in estimated mean er costs (n/v=us$ 1,499 vs without n/v=us$ 1,187, p=0.002). mean percentage activity impairment was higher in migraineurs with n/v than in those without n/v (37.73% vs 35.12%, p=0.002) and migraineurs with n/v had higher work productivity loss costs (n/v=us$ 10,344 vs without n/v=us$ 9,218, p=0.016). conclusion: migraine patients with n/v reported worse depression, sleep problems, and activity impairment, and higher er visits than those without n/v. migraine with n/v was also associated with an increase in mean annual er visit costs and work productivity loss costs. study findings suggest unmet needs with current treatment options for migraine patients with n/v.
migraine	background: calcitonin gene-related peptide provokes migraine attacks in 65% of patients with migraine without aura. whether aggregation of migraine in first-degree relatives (family load) or a high number of risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms contributes to migraine susceptibility to calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion in migraine patients is unknown. we hypothesized that genetic enrichment plays a role in triggering of migraine and, therefore, migraine without aura patients with high family load would report more migraine attacks after calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion than patients with low family load. methods: we allocated 40 previously genotyped migraine without aura patients to receive intravenous infusion of 1.5 mu g/min calcitonin gene-related peptide and recorded migraine attacks including headache characteristics and associated symptoms. information of familial aggregation was obtained by telephone interview of first-degree relatives using a validated semi-structured questionnaire. results: calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion induced a migraine-like attack in 75% (12 out of 16) of patients with high family load compared to 52% (12 out of 23) with low family load (p = 0.150). in addition, we found that the migraine response after calcitonin gene-related peptide was not associated with specific or a high number of risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms of migraine without aura. conclusion: we found no statistical association between familial aggregation of migraine and hypersensitivity to calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion in migraine without aura patients. we also demonstrated that the currently known single nucleotide polymorphisms conferring risk of migraine without aura have no additive effect on calcitonin gene-related peptide induced migraine-like attacks.
osteoarthritis	background: in 2002, moseley et al published a randomized controlled trial (rct) that showed no difference between knee arthroscopy and placebo for patients with osteoarthritis (oa). we wanted to assess the impact of the trial on clinical practice in the united states. purpose/hypothesis: to evaluate changes in knee arthroscopy practice before and after publication of the article by moseley et al and to assess the effect of this landmark rct on the behavior of practicing orthopaedic surgeons. we hypothesized that after publication of the moseley trial, the overall frequency of knee arthroscopy would decrease, that the mean age of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy would decrease, and that the proportion of arthroscopies for a diagnosis of oa would decrease. study design: descriptive epidemiology study. methods: the state ambulatory surgery database was used to analyze cases from 1998 to 2006, which were classified as meniscus tear, oa, or oa with meniscus tear. changes in age, surgery rates, and case classification were evaluated before and after moseley 's trial using student t tests and analysis of variance. results: after publication of the trial, the number of knee arthroscopies per year increased from 155,057 in 1998 to 172,317 in 2006 (p <= .001). mean patient age increased from 47.6 to 49.2 years (p < .001). meniscus tears increased from 69.1% to 70.8%, representing approximately 15,500 additional cases per year. oa decreased from 10.6% to 7.2%, representing approximately 4000 fewer cases per year. oa with meniscus tear increased from 20.3% to 22.0%, representing approximately 6400 additional cases per year. conclusion: while overall age and rates of knee arthroscopy increased contrary to our hypothesis, we identified a decrease in rates of knee arthroscopy for oa after publication of the moseley trial, demonstrating that well-publicized rcts can influence patterns of clinical practice.
osteoarthritis	background: several new rehabilitation modalities have been proposed after anterior cruciate ligament (acl) reconstruction. among these, trigger point dry needling (trp-dn) might be useful in the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome associated with acl reconstruction to reduce pain intensity, increase knee flexion range and modify the mechanical properties of the quadriceps muscle during late-stage rehabilitation. to date, this is the first randomized clinical trial to support the use of trp-dn in the early rehabilitation process after acl reconstruction. the aim of this study was to determine the pain intensity, range of motion (rom), stability, and functionality improvements by adding quadriceps vastus medialis trp-dn to the rehabilitation protocol (rh) provided to subacute acl reconstructed patients. methods: this randomized, single-blinded, clinical trial (nct02699411) included 44 subacute patients with surgical reconstruction of complete acl rupture. the patients were randomized into 2 intervention groups: rh (n=22) or rh+ trp-dn (n=22). pain intensity, rom, stability, and functionality were measured at baseline (a(0)) and immediately (a(1)), 24 hours (a(2)), 1 week (a(3)), and 5 weeks (a(4)) after the first treatment. results: comparing statistically significant differences (p.05). conclusion: quadriceps vastus medialis trp-dn in conjunction with a rehabilitation protocol in subacute patients with surgical reconstruction of complete acl rupture increases rom (short-term) and functionality (short-to mid-term). although there was an increase in pain intensity with the addition of trp-dn, this was not detected beyond immediately after the first treatment. furthermore, stability does not seem to be modified after trp-dn.
osteoarthritis	background: previous studies have reported varying return-to-sport protocols after knee cartilage restoration procedures. purpose: to (1) evaluate the time for return to sport in athletes with an isolated chondral injury who underwent an accelerated return-to-sport protocol after osteochondral autograft plug transfer (oat) and (2) evaluate clinical outcomes to assess for any consequences from the accelerated return to sport. study design: case series; level of evidence, 4. methods: an institutional cohort of 152 oat procedures was reviewed, of which 20 competitive athletes met inclusion and exclusion criteria. all patients underwent a physician-directed accelerated rehabilitation program after their procedure. return to sport was determined for all athletes. clinical outcomes were assessed using international knee documentation committee (ikdc) and tegner scores as well as assessment of level of participation on return to sport. results: return-to-sport data were available for all 20 athletes; 13 of 20 athletes (65%) were available for clinical evaluation at a mean 4.4-year follow-up. the mean time for return to sport for all 20 athletes was 82.9 25 days (range, 38-134 days). all athletes were able to return to sport at their previous level and reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their surgical outcome and ability to return to sport. the mean postoperative ikdc score was 84.5 +/- 9.5. the mean tegner score prior to injury was 8.9 +/- 1.7; it was 7.7 +/- 1.9 at final follow-up. conclusion: competitive athletes with traumatic chondral defects treated with oat managed using this protocol had reduced time to preinjury activity levels compared with what is currently reported, with excellent clinical outcomes and no serious long-term sequelae.

osteoarthritis	osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease caused by excessive death of chondrocytes and loss of the extracellular matrix (ecm) in articular cartilage. we previously reported that reactive oxygen species (ros) generated by the nadph oxidase (nox) isoform nox-2 are involved in chondrocyte death induced by interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta). in this study, we investigate the role of nox-2 in the production and degradation of ecm by chondrocytes. although il-1 beta lowered the mrna expression of type ii collagen (col2a1) and aggrecan (acan) in mouse chondrocyte-like atdc5 cells, rna silencing of nox2 did not change the mrna expression of these major components of the ecm of cartilage. hence, nox-2 is not involved in the il-1 beta-induced suppression of ecm production. on the other hand, the nox inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (aebsf), the ros scavenger n-acetylcysteine and an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for nox2 prevented the loss of proteoglycan induced by il-1 beta in highly differentiated atdc5 cells. furthermore, aebsf did not affect the expression of hyaluronidase-1 and -2, whereas it suppressed hyaluronidase activity in culture medium. il-1 beta-induced intra- and extracellular acidification was also suppressed by aebsf, as was the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for nox2. since hyaluronidase activity is known to be higher under acidic conditions, nox-2 probably contributes to ecm loss by the activation of hyaluronidase through acidification.
hereditary_angioedema	factor xii is a mysterious plasma protein without a clear physiologic function. it was identified as a clotting factor, but has no clear role in hemostasis. however, fxii also contributes to the production of bradykinin, a short-lived inflammatory peptide. a growing body of mechanistic research from animal models indicates that fxii contributes to thrombotic disease by triggering excessive coagulation. fxii is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that this molecule does have a physiologic function. this leads to intriguing questions: what does fxii really do? is it even a real clotting factor at all? before the groundbreaking discovery of a role for fxii in thrombotic disease, many studies investigated the biochemical properties of fxii and its activators. in this review, we highlight several biochemical studies that reveal much about the natural behavior of fxii. on the basis of these findings, it is possible to draft a conceptual model to explain how fxii reacts to surface materials. we then discuss how this model applies to the activities of fxii in its natural environment. there are two tentative physiologic functions of fxii that can operate exclusively: (i) maintenance of thrombus stability; (ii) local regulation of vascular permeability. either, or both, of these natural functions may explain the evolutionary development and maintenance of fxii.

hereditary_angioedema	plasma kallikrein (pk), a serine protease in the trypsin clan (sa), plays critical roles in many physiological and pathological pathways. regulating the abnormal activity of pk has been successfully used in the clinical therapy of hereditary angioedema. in this study, the serine protease domain of murine plasma kallikrein (mpk) was expressed in the pichia pastoris system. the recombinant protein was a glycosylated active enzyme after purification by the cation exchange and size-exclusion chromatography, and was crystallized at the precipitant condition of 25% peg 3350, 0.1 m tris-hcl ph 8.5 and 0.1 m nacl. the crystal structure of mpk was determined at 2.6 angstrom. this is the first published crystal structure of mpk, showing some distinctive features at s2' and s3' pockets when compared to its human analogue (human plasma kallikrein, hpk). in addition, mpk show unique structural features in the non-conservative 67-72 and 76-81 loops when compared to other serine proteases. these results provide insights for the design of potent and selective pk inhibitors.
hereditary_angioedema	the association of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (hht) and type i hereditary angioedema is a very rare condition in medicine. the case reported by muller et al., describes the coexistence of the two diseases and emphasizes the need for listing hht patients for liver transplantation in case indications occurs, such as the presence of hcc, abnormally increased cardiac output, and gastrointestinal bleeding as reported for this case. the case described by mueller et al. is anecdotal for the usefulness of liver transplantation in hht patients and shows that liver transplantation may be the best supportive care and, sometimes, the unique and final therapeutic option for these patients.
hereditary_angioedema	angioedema is a rare condition which manifests as sudden localised, non-pitting swelling of certain body parts including skin and mucous membranes. it is vital that anaesthesiologists understand this condition, as it may present suddenly in the perioperative period with airway compromise. to identify literature for this review, the authors searched the pubmed, medline, embase, scopus and web of science databases for english language articles covering a 10-year period, 2006 through 2016. angioedema can be either mast-cell mediated or bradykinin-induced. older therapies for histaminergic symptoms are well known to anaesthesiologists (e.g., adrenaline, anti-histamines and steroids), whereas older therapies for bradykinin-induced symptoms include plasma and attenuated androgens. new classes of drugs for bradykinin-induced symptoms are now available, including anti-bradykinin, plasma kallikrein inhibitor and c1 esterase inhibitors. these can be used prophylactically or as rescue medications. anaesthesiologists are in a unique position to coordinate perioperative care for this complex group of patients.
kidney_health	chronic kidney diseases are a social and economic problem, and diet has long been recognized as a fundamental modulator of kidney health in human and experimental models. age-dependent alterations in mitochondrial function play a crucial role in the development of diseases of aging, and mitochondrial disorders have been observed in experimental models of kidney failure. recently, the beneficial dietary effect of a specific mixture of essential amino acids (eaa) has been studied in elderly subjects, but no data were collected from the kidney. the aim of this study was to assess whether daily supplementation of the diet with eaa at the beginning of senescence could preserve renal health. we used middle-aged (18-month-old) male wistar rats fed a standard diet and water ad libitum (m-aged group) or a diet with added eaa (1.5 g/kg per day) dissolved in drinking water for 3 months (m-aged+eaa group). young (2-month-old) rats fed a standard diet for 3 months were used as controls. mitochondrial morphology and markers for collagen, cyt-c-oxidase, hsp60, grp75, enos, inos, bax, bcl2 and vegf were analyzed in glomeruli and tubules. eaa supplementation limited fibrosis and increased the capillary tuft area in the glomeruli of m-aged rats. vegf and enos were enhanced in glomeruli and the peritubular space with the eaa-supplemented diet. mitochondrial cyt-c oxidase, bcl2, and chaperones increased in the distal tubules of the eaa group to levels similar to those observed in the young group. mitochondrial area and density after eaa intake did not differ from young groups. the results suggest that prolonged eaa intake could represent a strategy for maintaining the healthy status of the kidney in m-aged animals.
kidney_health	although it affects <1% of the us population, stage 4 chronic kidney disease (ckd) has increased in prevalence in the united states, grown 67% between the early 1990s and the first part of this decade. it is important to consider new strategies to slow or halt this increase. a frameshift in patient care delivery is underway in kidney health care in the united states with a medicare education benefit for patients with stage 4 ckd. this medicare benefit is a unique program that has the potential to inform patients and families about ckd and prepare them for transitions in health states and kidney health care. for the greatest value of this benefit to be realized, it is critical for the health care community to accurately gauge patient understanding of ckd and provide curricula that are comprehensible and actionable for patients. this type of benefit is patient centered, yet it will succeed only with a willingness to review its effectiveness and revise it if needed. am j kidney dis. 57(3):381-386.

kidney_health	aboriginal canadian patients with end-stage kidney disease receive disproportionately fewer transplants than non-aboriginal patients. the reasons for this are poorly understood and likely to be complex. this qualitative study employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with canadian kidney health professionals (n = 23) from programs across canada to explore their perspective on this disparity. individual-level factors were the most commonly reported barriers to aboriginal patients accessing transplants-most notable of which was patients' remote living location. understanding the role of 'place' as a barrier to accessing care and the lived experiences of aboriginal patients emerged as key research priorities.

kidney_health	study 1: a study was conducted to determine the effects of geriatric foods utilizing 40 healthy geriatric cats (>= 12 years, initially 4.6 kg). cats were fed a control food during a 30-day pre-feeding period, blocked by age, gender, and body fat percentage, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 foods (a = experimental geriatric food, b = lams active maturity, c = royal canin mature 28, and d = purina one senior protection formula) for the 90-day testing period. chemistry screens and microalbuminuria were evaluated at day 30 and day 90 along with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) scan at day 90. cats fed all foods maintained weight and body fat content throughout the study. at day 90, cats fed food d had reduced (p < 0.01) bone mineral content. cats fed food a and c had reduced (p < 0.03) lean. cats fed food a tended to have a lower percentage of cats with renal damage (p < 0.08) compared with cats fed food b. for vital organ measures, cats fed food a had lower (p0.15). however, cats fed food h weighed less and had less fat (p < 0.03) compared with cats fed food e. cats fed food f also had less fat (p0.35). by combining the data from both studies and plotting increasing lysine:calorie ratio versus lean loss for each corresponding ratio, a strong linear relationship could be detected with the line representing 75% (r-2 = 0.75) of the variation in lean loss. a moderate linear relationship was detected as bone mineral content decreased with increasing crude protein concentration (r-2 = 0.24). these studies suggest that feeding a food with reduced protein/phosphorus and higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as antioxidants improved markers of kidney function compared with other commercial formulas. additionally, increasing the lysine:calorie ratio prevented the loss of lean body mass in the geriatric cat and provided a similar response to high protein foods.
kidney_health	backgroundknowledge about kidney disease among the general population is poor but has not been assessed in the population selected for referral to nephrology care. aimthis study aimed to determine patients' understanding of chronic kidney disease (ckd) when first presenting to a nephrology clinic. methodsnewly referred patients to a nephrology clinic were surveyed with open-ended questions about their understanding of ckd causes, symptoms and management. resultstwo hundred and ten patients were surveyed. median age was 66.5 years (interquartile range 52-77), 50.5% female and mean body mass index 29.7 6.8kg/m(2). prevalence of risk factors for ckd included 31% diabetic, 62% hypertension, 19% family history of ckd and 2% aboriginal or torres strait islander. ckd stage prevalence was 0 (8%), 1 (24%), 2 (11%), 3 (38.5%), 4 (18%) and 5 (0.5%). eighty-two per cent were referred by their primary care physician and 29% had seen a nephrologist previously. kidney health australia was mentioned by 2.4%. sixteen per cent were unsure why they had been referred. ckd causes identified by patients were unsure (40%), alcohol (29%), hypertension (16%) and diabetes (14%). symptoms identified included asymptomatic (16%), kidney pain (17%) and other (42%). management suggested by patients was uncertain (51%), dialysis (32%) and anti-hypertensive medication (16%). eighty-two per cent reported unsatisfactory education from their primary care physician. conclusionsnew patients referred to a renal outpatient department had poor knowledge about kidney disease. education of patients should begin in primary care prior to referral. for most patients, education programmes need to be targeted at a simplistic level.
autism	background: down syndrome (ds) is the most common chromosomal aberration, but the characteristics of the brainstem component in this condition during childhood (from newborn to preteen stages) have not been clarified. objective: to evaluate the morphological features of the brainstem in ds on magnetic resonance imaging (mri). materials and methods: mris for 32 children with ds (16 boys and girls each; age range, 0-11 years) without major brain insults, and 32 age-matched controls (16 boys and girls each) were retrospectively analyzed. height, width, and area of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata were measured on sagittal t1-weighted images; these were compared in children with ds and age-matched controls. the ratios of the brainstem to the size of the posterior fossa (bs/pf index) were calculated; these were also compared in the children with ds and the control group. results: the width and area of the midbrain; height, width, area of the pons; and area of the medulla oblongata were significantly smaller in children with ds than in control children (p < 0.05); the area of the pons, particularly for the ventral part, showed the largest differences in the mean relative differences. the bs/pf indices of the height, width, and area of the pons were significantly smaller in children with ds than in the control group (p < 0.01). however, the bs/pf indices for the midbrain and the medulla oblongata did not differ between these two groups. conclusions: children with ds may have small brainstems, particularly in the pons; this may be a characteristic morphological feature of the brainstem on mri in childhood including neonates.

autism	backgroundthis study explored psychological adjustment and sibling relationships of siblings of children with life-limiting conditions (llcs), expanding on previous research by defining llcs using a systematic classification of these conditions. methodsthirty-nine siblings participated, aged 3-16years. parents completed measures of siblings' emotional and behavioural difficulties, quality of life, sibling relationships and impact on families and siblings. sibling and family adjustment and relationships were compared with population norms, where available, and to a matched comparison group of siblings of children with autistic spectrum disorder (asd), as a comparable high risk' group. resultsllc siblings presented significantly higher levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties, and lower quality of life than population norms. their difficulties were at levels comparable to siblings of children with asd. a wider impact on the family was confirmed. family socio-economic position, time since diagnosis, employment and accessing hospice care were factors associated with better psychological adjustment. conclusionsusing a systematic classification of llcs, the study supported earlier findings of increased levels of psychological difficulties in siblings of children with a llc. the evidence is (i) highlighting the need to provide support to these siblings and their families, and (ii) that intervention approaches could be drawn from the asd field.
autism	although the challenges that autistic students face adapting to college are often pronounced, they are similar to the challenges that students with other disabilities face (e.g., difficulties with social interaction, self-advocacy, and executive functioning). however, extant evaluations of services for autistic college students are very limited despite an emerging literature examining supports for college students with a range of other disabilities. given that many autistic students do not self-identify as autistic in college, and consequently might avoid autism-specific services, autistic students might benefit from services that are designed to support a broad range of neurodiverse students, or services that are structured according to the principles of universal design. in order to develop such services, we assessed the self-reported needs of autistic college students and their peers with other disabilities. guided by needs assessments and feedback from students, we developed and evaluated two semesters of mentor-led group programming for autistic college students and students with other disabilities. the first semester of the program focused on social skills; after receiving feedback from participants, the curriculum for the second semester focused on self-advocacy. participation in social-skills groups was associated with decreased anxiety and autism symptoms. participation in self-advocacy groups was associated with increased perceived social support from friends, academic self-efficacy, and more accurate definitions of self-advocacy. this research suggests that supports for neurodiverse college students should be developed with their input and should include opportunities to engage with diverse peers.
autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd), a condition defined along a continuum of sociocommunicative difficulties, is associated with unique patterns of memory functioning including difficulties with autobiographical memory (am). am refers to memory for information related to the self and personally experienced events and has a strong social function. the current paper reviews empirical studies assessing am among individuals with asd across the lifespan. results support that both children and adults with asd manifest am difficulties characterized by (a) reduced specificity, (b) less elaborated and detailed am narratives, (c) lower am coherence, and (d) increased reliance on scaffolding for retrieval. individuals with asd also demonstrate intact am for certain memory indices and show evidence of using compensatory strategies to facilitate retrieval. results are interpreted in relation to models of typically developing am and broad memory theory, as well as models of information processing specific to asd. to advance knowledge of how am develops within the context of asd, a developmental psychopathology perspective is applied to the consideration of candidate processes underlying developing am among individuals with asd. future research should consider support for mechanisms that promote am performance at multiple ecological levels. limitations, clinical implications for intervention, and future directions are discussed.

autism	introduction: data from an eeg is not commonly used by psychiatrists to plan treatment and medication. however, eeg abnormalities such as isolated epileptiform discharges are found to be more prevalent in psychiatric patients, particularly those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (asd). most medications prescribed for asd lower seizure threshold and increase side effects. therefore, it may be prudent to order an eeg for asd cases, especially those categorized as refractory. methods: the data set was obtained from a multidisciplinary practice that treats a wide variety of neuroatypical children and adolescent refractory patients. this study investigated 140 nonepileptic subjects diagnosed with asd, aged 4 to 25 years. visual inspection of the eeg was performed to search for paroxysmal, focal, or lateralizing patterns. results: of the 140 subjects, the eeg data identified 36% with isolated epileptiform discharges. the x(2) analysis found no significant difference between genders among the three age groups. findings indicated a high prevalence of isolated epileptiform discharges among individuals with asd. conclusions: our results find that compared with the healthy population, a large number of patients with asd have isolated epileptiform discharges despite never having a seizure. our findings support the use of eeg in children, adolescents, and young adults with asd, regardless of gender or age. this is particularly true for those who exhibit aggressive behaviors or those who have failed previous medication attempts with stimulants, antidepressants, and/or antipsychotics.
