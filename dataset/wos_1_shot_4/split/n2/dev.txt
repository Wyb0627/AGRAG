alzheimer's_disease	the formation of soluble oligomers of amyloid beta 42 and 40 (a beta 42, a beta 40) is the initial event in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease (ad). based on previous systematic proline replacement and solid-state nmr, we proposed a toxic dimer structure of a beta 42, a highly aggregative alloform, with a turn at positions 22 and 23, and a hydrophobic core in the c-terminal region. however, in addition to a beta 42, a beta 40 dimers can also contribute to ad progression because of the more abundance of a beta 40 monomer in biological fluids. here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of three dimer models of the toxic-conformation constrained e22p-a beta 40 using l,l-2,6-diaminopimeric acid (dap) or l,l-2,8diaminoazelaic acid (daz) linker at position 30, which is incorporated into the intermolecular parallel beta-sheet region, and dap at position 38 in the c-terminal hydrophobic core. e22p-a3odap-a beta 40 dimer (1) and e22p-a3odaz-a beta 40 dimer (2) existed mainly in oligomeric states even after 2 weeks incubation without forming fibrils, unlike the corresponding monomer. their neurotoxicity toward sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells was very weak. in contrast, e22p-g38dap-a beta 40 dimer (3) formed beta-sheet rich oligomeric aggregates, and exhibited more potent neurotoxicity than the corresponding monomer. ion mobility mass spectrometry suggested that high molecular-weight oligomers (12-24-mer) of 3 form, but not for 1 and 2 after 4 h incubation. these findings indicate that formation of the hydrophobic core at the c-terminus, rather than intermolecular parallel beta-sheet, triggers the formation of toxic a beta oligomers. compound 3 may be a suitable model for studying the etiology of alzheimer 's disease.
parkinson's_disease	in parkinson 's disease, the enhanced beta rhythm is closely associated with akinesia/bradykinesia and rigidity. an increase in beta oscillations (12-35 hz) within the basal ganglia (bg) nuclei does not proliferate throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop in uniform fashion; rather it can be subdivided into two distinct frequency bands, i.e. the lower beta (12-20 hz) and upper beta (21-35 hz). a computational model of the excitatory and inhibitory neural network that focuses on the population properties is proposed to explore the mechanism underlying the pathological beta oscillations. simulation results show several findings. the upper beta frequency in the bg originates from a high frequency cortical beta, while the emergence of exaggerated lower beta frequency in the bg depends greatly on the enhanced excitation of a reciprocal network consisting of the globus pallidus externus (gpe) and the subthalamic nucleus (stn). there is also a transition mechanism between the upper and lower beta oscillatory activities, and we explore the impact of self-inhibition within the gpe on the relationship between the upper beta and lower beta oscillations. it is shown that increased self-inhibition within the gpe contributes to increased upper beta oscillations driven by the cortical rhythm, while decrease in the self-inhibition within the gpe facilitates an enhancement of the lower beta oscillations induced by the increased excitability of the bg. this work provides an analysis for understanding the mechanism underlying pathological synchronization in neurological diseases.

sprains_and_strains	traumatic ankle injury is a frequent clinical presentation. ankle taping is commonly used in the prophylaxis of sprains and as an adjunct during rehabilitation of ankle injury. the mechanisms behind taping remain unclear however, one possible mechanism is improved proprioception and peroneal reflex responses. this study investigated the peroneal reflex response to rapid inversion (using a trapdoor) with different taping protocols. the dominant leg of 31 healthy subjects was tested in three conditions: no taping; simple prophylactic taping; and circumferential leg taping. a repeated measures anova revealed no statistically significant effect across conditions or trials. the results suggest that neurophysiological responses to sudden inversion are not altered by mechanical or sensory input from taping in normal subjects.
cancer	purpose the aim of this study was to assess the value of dual-time point imaging in pet/ct for detection of biochemically recurrent or persistent prostate cancer, using the prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) ligand [ga-68]psma i&t. methods 240 patients who underwent a [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct in the context of biochemical relapse of prostate cancer were included in this retrospective analysis. imaging consisted of a standard whole-body pet/ct (1 h p.i.), followed by delayed (3 h p.i.) imaging of the abdomen. psa-stratified proportions of positive pet/ct results, standardized uptake values and target-to-background ratios were analyzed, and compared between standard and delayed imaging. results the overall detection rates of [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct were 94.2, 71.8, 58.6, 55.9 and 38.9% for psa levels of >= 2, 1 to < 2, 0.5 to0.2 to < 0.5, and 0.01 to 0.2 ng/ml, respectively. although the target-to-background ratio improved significantly over time (p < 0.0001), the majority (96.6%) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease could already be detected in standard imaging. delayed imaging at 3 h p.i. exclusively identified pathologic findings in 5.4% (10/184) of abnormal [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct scans, and exclusively detected 3.4% (38/1134) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease. [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct shows high detection rates in patients with prostate-specific antigen persistence or biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. delayed imaging can detect lesions with improved contrast compared to standard imaging. however, the impact on detection rates was limited in this study.
sports_injuries	introduction: patellar dislocation is an emergency. vertical patellar dislocation is rare, often seen in adolescents and mostly due to sports injuries or high-velocity trauma. few cases have been reported in the literature. closed or open reduction under general anesthesia is often needed. we report a case of vertical locked patellar dislocation in a 26-year-old male, which was reduced by a simple closed method under spinal anaesthesia. a literature review regarding the various methods of treatment is also discussed. case presentation: a 26-year-old male experienced a trivial accident while descending stairs, sustaining patellar dislocation. the closed method of reduction was attempted, using a simple technique. reduction was confirmed and postoperative rehabilitation was started. follow-up was uneventful. conclusions: vertical patellar dislocations are encountered rarely in the emergency department. adolescents are not the only victims, and high-velocity trauma is not the essential cause. unnecessary manipulation should be avoided. the closed reduction method is simple, but the surgeon should be prepared for open reduction.
senior_health	objective: to assess the effect of introducing consensus guidelines on avoidable blood transfusions in mwanza region, tanzania. methods: avoidable blood transfusions were determined among 842 blood transfusion recipients in eight hospitals in 1991. in a workshop with senior health workers from the region, consensus guidelines for the prescription of blood transfusions were developed and introduced in the hospitals and after 7 months intervention data were collected on 1042 blood transfusion recipients. the 1991 and 1992 data were compared to estimate the change in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions. results: in blood transfusion recipients aged <5 years there was a significant reduction in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions from 257 (52%) out of 498 to 197 (33%) out of 595 (p<0.001), especially at the peripheral hospitals. for children the proportion decreased from 25 to 17% (p<0.05) and for operated patients the percentage remained at 24%. in pregnant women there was a significant increase in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions from 10 to 27% and in adults from 37 (25%) out of 146 to 121 (50%) out of 242. the improvement in peripheral hospitals was offset by a similar deterioration in the referral hospital, thus no overall reduction was achieved in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions. conclusion: the development and introduction of consensus guidelines was not sufficient to change prescribing practice. the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions decreased only in hospitals where compliance was maintained through regular clinic meetings and strict supervision by senior medical staff.
multiple_sclerosis	purposemagnetic susceptibility is a physical property of matter that varies depending on chemical composition and abundance of different molecular species. interest is growing in mapping of magnetic susceptibility in the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging techniques, but the influences affecting the mapped values are not fully understood. methodswe performed quantitative susceptibility mapping on 7 tesla (t) multiple echo time gradient recalled echo data and evaluated the trend in 10 regions of the human brain. temporal plots of susceptibility were performed in the caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, insula, red nucleus, substantia nigra, internal capsule, corpus callosum, and fornix. we implemented an existing three compartment signal model and used optimization to fit the experimental result to assess the influences that could be responsible for our findings. resultsthe temporal trend in susceptibility is different for different brain regions, and subsegmentation of specific regions suggests that differences are likely to be attributable to variations in tissue structure and composition. using a signal model, we verified that a nonlinear temporal behavior in experimentally computed susceptibility within imaging voxels may be the result of the heterogeneous composition of tissue properties. conclusionsdecomposition of voxel constituents into meaningful parameters may lead to informative measures that reflect changes in tissue microstructure. magn reson med 77:1946-1958, 2017.

hepatitis_c	hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is currently the most important cause of chronic viral hepatitis in the world and one of the most frequent indications for liver transplantation. hcv uses different strategies to evade the innate and adaptive immune response, and this evasion plays a key role in determining viral persistence. several hcv viral proteins have been described as immune modulators. in this review, we will focus on the effect of hcv nucleocapsid core protein in the function of immune cells and its correlation with the findings observed in hcv chronically infected patients. effects on immune cell function related to both extracellular and intracellular hcv core localization will be considered. this review provides an updated perspective on the mechanisms involved in hcv evasion related to one single hcv protein, which could become a key tool in the development of new antiviral strategies able to control and/or eradicate hcv infection.
weight_loss	the present study aimed to determine the effect of a green tea supplement on anthropometric indices and inflammatory factors in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). in this randomized clinical trial, 45 women with pcos were randomly allocated into two groups receiving green tea tablets or placebo. the period of intervention was 45days. the serum levels of interleukin 6, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor were measured before and after intervention period using the related kits. anthropometric indices also were measured. the mean of body mass index, weight, waist circumference, and body fat percentage in the green tea group were reduced significantly. however, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. also, there was no significant effect on the levels of inflammatory factors. the present results suggest that daily consumption of green tea tablets did not cause any effect on inflammation biomarkers in pcos women. however, it may be effective as a complementary treatment for weight control in these women. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
low_testosterone	serum testosterone is reduced in up to 90% of men with cirrhosis, with levels falling as liver disease advances. testosterone is an important anabolic hormone, with effects on muscle, bone, and hematopoiesis. many of the features of advanced liver disease are similar to those seen in hypogonadal men, including sarcopenia, osteoporosis, gynecomastia, and low libido. however, the relative contribution of testosterone deficiency to the symptomatology of advanced liver disease has not been well established. more recently, it has been demonstrated that low testosterone in men with cirrhosis is associated with increased mortality, independent of the classically recognized prognostic factors, such as the model for end-stage liver disease score. only several small clinical trials have examined the role of testosterone therapy in men with cirrhosis, none of which have resolved the issue of whether or not testosterone is beneficial. however, in men with organic hypogonadism due to structural hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis disease, testosterone therapy has been shown to improve muscle mass and bone mineral density, increase hemoglobin, and reduce insulin resistance. despite initial concerns linking testosterone with hepatocellular carcinoma, more recent data suggest that this risk has been overstated. there is, therefore, now a strong rationale to assess the efficacy and safety of testosterone therapy in cirrhosis in well-designed randomized controlled trials.
fungal_infection	near-infrared (nir) hyperspectral imaging system was used to detect five concentration levels of ochratoxin a (ota) in contaminated wheat kernels. the wheat kernels artificially inoculated with two different ota producing penicillium verrucosum strains, two different non-toxigenic p. verrucosum strains, and sterile control wheat kernels were subjected to nir hyperspectral imaging. the acquired three-dimensional data were reshaped into readable two-dimensional data. principal component analysis (pca) was applied to the two dimensional data to identify the key wavelengths which had greater significance in detecting ota contamination in wheat. statistical and histogram features extracted at the key wavelengths were used in the linear, quadratic and mahalanobis statistical discriminant models to differentiate between sterile control, five concentration levels of ota contamination in wheat kernels, and five infection levels of non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels. the classification models differentiated sterile control samples from ota contaminated wheat kernels and non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels with a 100% accuracy. the classification models also differentiated between five concentration levels of ota contaminated wheat kernels and between five infection levels of non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels with a correct classification of more than 98%. the non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels and ota contaminated wheat kernels subjected to hyperspectral imaging provided different spectral patterns. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.

parenting	backgroundpractices to facilitate self-determination have not received appropriate attention in research concerning parents with intellectual disabilities (id). likewise, parenting interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities have seldom observed both parent and child behavioural outcomes. methodsthis study evaluated the effectiveness of a parenting intervention embedded with self-determination facilitation practices for two dyads of a parent with intellectual disabilities and their young child. the interventions focused on increasing parents' ability to correctly implement steps of a parenting routine while reducing occurrence of challenging child behaviour. resultsthe results of the study demonstrated two basic effects of correctly completed steps of the parenting routine and a reduction of challenging child behaviour. parents also reported decreased feelings of stress during the routine following completion of the intervention. conclusionsimplications for future research and replication of this pilot study are discussed.
birth_control	the role of secularization in the european fertility decline has been of interest to demographers, who often explore the relationship on a macro-level or by identifying religious affiliation by proxy. however, the relationship has not been thoroughly studied on an individual level utilizing indicators of personal religious conviction and affiliation. the aim of the present article is to examine reproductive practices by religious affiliation in order to understand the impact of secularization on fertility decline. this is accomplished using event history analysis of longitudinal parish register data from sundsvall (1860-1921) where religious affiliation is identified on a family level. reproductive practices are analysed using cohort tfr, descriptive statistics and cox proportional hazard regressions. free-church affiliates had, overall, a higher probability of having another child than did affiliates to the state church. however, these differences decreased over time, and as fertility dropped throughout society free-church affiliates showed the strongest significant reduction in probability of another birth. this indicates that over time, within the free churches, ideas about respectability and restraint came to mean that birth control, in the form of abstinence within marriage, became an important practice in the formation of gendered religious identities - leading to a relatively early decrease in fertility.
heart_disease	an increasing evidence base suggests that low bone mineral density (bmd) and fractures are associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd). we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the evidence of low bmd and fractures as risk factors for future cvd. two independent authors searched major databases from inception to august 1, 2016, for longitudinal studies reporting data on cvd incidence (overall and specific cvd) and bmd status and fractures. the association between low bmd, fractures, and cvd across longitudinal studies was explored by calculating pooled adjusted hazard ratios (hrs)+/- 95% confidence intervals (cis) with a random-effects meta-analysis. twenty-eight studies (18 regarding bmd and 10 fractures) followed a total of 1,107,885 participants for a median of 5 years. taking those with higher bmd as the reference, people with low bmd were at increased risk of developing cvd during follow-up (11 studies; hr=1.33; 95%ci, 1.27 to 1.38; i-2=53%), after adjusting for a median of eight confounders. this finding was confirmed using a decrease in one standard deviation of baseline bmd (9 studies; hr=1.16; 95% ci, 1.09 to 1.24; i-2=69%). the presence of fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing cvd (hr=1.20; 95% ci, 1.06 to 1.37; i-2=91%). regarding specific cvds, low bmd was associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular conditions, and cvd-associated death. fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular conditions and death due to cvd. in conclusion, low bmd and fractures are associated with a small, but significant increased risk of cvd risk and possibly death.

allergies	introduction: the therapeutic use of animals has been debated for decades, and its use explored in a variety of settings and populations. however, there is no uniformity on naming these interventions. evidence based knowledge is essential to implement effective strategies in hospital. this review focused on the use of animal programs for hospitalized patients, and considered the potential risks. methods: the following databases were searched: pubmed, scopus, psychinfo, ebsco animals, proquest, web of science, cinahl, and medline, and prisma guidelines were adhered to. results: out of 432 articles were identified 36 articles suitable for inclusion into the review. data was heterogeneous in terms of age of patient, health issue, animals used and the length of interactions, which made comparison problematic. studies on children, psychiatric and elderly patients were the most common. the animal-intervention programs suggested various benefits such as reducing stress, pain and anxiety. other outcomes considered were changes in vital signs, and nutritional intake. most studies used dogs, but other animals were effectively employed. the major risks outlined were allergies, infections and animal-related accidents. zoonosis was a possible risk, as well as common infections as methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus. the implementation of simple hygiene protocols was effective at minimizing risk. the literature suggested that the benefits outweighed by far the risks. conclusion: the human relationship with animals can be useful and relatively safe for inpatients with various problems. moreover, the implementation of security precautions and the careful selection of patients should minimize the risks, particularly those infection-related. many aspects remain unclear, further studies are required.

menopause	objective: the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator, the pituitary gonadotropes, the ovaries, and the uterus play a crucial role in female fertility. a decline in reproductive performance represents a complex interplay of actions at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. recently, in the field of female reproductive aging attention is drawn to the carbonyl stress theory. advanced glycation end products (ages) contribute directly to protein damage, induce a chain of oxidative stress (os) reactions, and increase inflammatory reactions. here, we highlight some of the mechanisms underlying glycation damage in the ovary. methods: searches of electronic databases were performed. articles relevant to possible role of os, ages, and receptor for age (rage) in aging ovary were summarized in this interpretive literature review. results: follicular microenvironment undergoes an increase in os with aging. data support the role of os in ovulatory dysfunction because ages are well-recognized mediators of increased os. rage and age-modified proteins with activated nuclear factor-kappa b are expressed in human ovarian tissue. it was suggested that accumulation of ages products at the level of the ovarian follicle might trigger early ovarian aging or could be responsible for reduced glucose uptake by granulosa cells, potentially altering follicular growth. moreover, impaired methylglyoxal detoxification causing relevant damage to the ovarian proteome might be one of the mechanisms underlying reproductive aging. conclusions: further investigation of the role for the age-rage axis in the ovarian follicular environment is needed, and results could relate to assisted reproduction technology outcomes and new measures of ovarian reserve.
emergency_contraception	in argentina, campaigns for the recognition of sexual and reproductive rights have sparked opposition through litigation in which the dynamics of legal action have come from self-proclaimed ""pro-life"" ngo5, particularly since 1998, when the conservative ngo portal de belen successfully achieved the banning of emergency contraception through the courts. the activities of these groups, acting as a ""civil arm"" of religion, are focused primarily on obstructing access to legally permissible abortions and bringing about the withdrawal of a number of recognized public policies on sexual and reproductive health, particularly the 2002 national programme for sexual health and responsible procreation. this paper analyzes the litigation strategies of these conservative ngos and how their use of the courts in argentina has changed over the years. it gives examples of efforts in local courts to block individual young women from accessing legal abortion following rape, despite a ruling by the national supreme court of justice in 2012 that no judicial permission is required. in spite of major advances, the renewed influence of the catholic hierarchy in the argentine political scene with the accession of the new pope poses challenges to the work by feminists and women 's movements to extend and consolidate sexual and reproductive rights.

skin_care	a sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was established for the simultaneous determination of thirteen n-nitrosamines (nas) in skin care cosmetics. the cosmetics samples were firstly dispersed by water and subsequently extracted and purified using salting out-acetonitrile homogeneous extraction method. finally, the extracting solution was concentrated by slow nitrogen gas blowing. all of the samples were separated by innowax capillary chromatographic column, and detected by selected ion monitoring (sim) mode of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and quantified by isotope internal standard method. the method was validated for linearity and range, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. under the optimized condition, the calibration curves were linear over the selected concentration ranges of 2-500 mu g/l for all the thirteen analytes, with calculated coefficients of determination (r-2) of greater than 0.996. the limits of detection (lods) and the limits of quantitation (loqs) of the method were 3-15 mu g/kg and 10-50 mu g/kg, respectively. recoveries were calculated at three levels of concentration spiked in two kinds of cosmetics (skin care cream and water). the values were found between 93.8% and 121.0% with relative standard deviation (rsd) values of 2.5-7.2% for intra-day precision (n = 6) and 3.3-6.7% for inter-day precision (n = 5). the method was successfully applied to analyze twenty-two cosmetics samples and n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma) was detected in one sample with the concentration of 207 mu g/kg.

myelofibrosis	we evaluated ruxolitinib in 65 patients with myelofibrosis according to age, sex, time of diagnosis, grade of fibrosis, prognostic score risk, janus kinase (jak) status, primary or secondary myelofibrosis, previous treatment, and dosage. outcome measures were response rate, time to response, duration of response, and event-free survival and survival. kaplan and meier curves show a significant difference in event-free survival according to the prognostic score, in favor of patients with low int1 (p = 0.0009). the cox stepwise model confirmed the result, the int2 high-risk score being the most powerful negative independent parameter (0.001), followed by jak (0.008); other parameters, such as diagnosis more than 5 years earlier, grade iii-iv fibrosis, and ruxolitinib dose have a negligible impact. time to response was shorter (p = 0.001) in primary myelofibrosis. in conclusion, ruxolitinib is effective, with a better outcome in patients with a low-int1 risk score. this may suggest considering an earlier administration in the disease course.
hypothyroidism	hypothyroidism is associated with the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but cellular mechanisms have been scarcely analyzed. thyroid hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of bile acids that are endogenous ligands of the farnesoid receptor (fxr alpha), which have been involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. however, the relationship between thyroid hormones and fxr alpha expression in the liver is yet unknown. control (n = 6) and methimazole-induced hypothyroid (n = 6) female rabbits were used to evaluate the amount of lipids and glycogen, vascularization, hepatocytes proliferation, immune cells infiltration, and expression of fxr alpha. student-t or mann-whitney u tests were carried out to determine significant differences. hypothyroidism induced steatosis, glycogen loss, fibrosis, and a minor vascularization in the liver. in contrast, hypothyroidism increased the proliferation of hepatocytes and the infiltration of mast cells, but did not modify the number of immune cells into sinusoids. these changes were associated with a minor anti-fxr alpha immunoreactivity of periportal hepatocytes and pericentral immune cells. our results suggest that hypothyroidism induces a moderate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, alllowing the hepatic regeneration. the fxr alpha may be involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in hypothyroid subjects.
headache	gentiana veitchiorum hemsl., gentianaceae, a traditional tibetan medicine, was used for the treatment of liver jaundice with damp-heat pathogen, as well as for headache and chronic pharyngitis. a rapidultra-performance liquid chromatography, photodiode array detector, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed for the fast and accurate identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of g. veitchiorum. in fact, eighteen compounds were detected and identified on the basis of their mass spectra, fragment characteristics and comparison with published data. especially, the ms fragmentation pathways of iridoid glycosides and flavone c-glycosides were illustrated. five compounds among them were quantified by uhplc-pda, including swertiamarin, gentiopicroside, sweroside, isoorientin, and isovitexin. the proposed method was then validated based on the analyses of linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery. the overall recoveries for the five analytes ranged from 96.54% to 100.81%, with rsd from 1.05% to 1.82%. in addition, ten batches of g. veitchiorum from different areas were also analyzed. the developed method was rapid and reliable for both identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of g. veitchiorum, especially for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of iridoid glycosides and flavone c-glycosides.

overactive_bladder	purpose: nocturia is common and bothersome in older adults, especially those who are also incontinent. since nocturnal polyuria is a major contributor, we examined factors associated with nocturnal polyuria in this population to identify those possibly amenable to intervention. materials and methods: we analyzed baseline data from 2 previously completed studies of urge urinary incontinence. the studies involved 284women (mean age +/- sd 72.9 +/- 7.9 years) who also completed 3-day voiding diaries. participants with a nocturnal polyuria index greater than 33% were categorized as having nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal polyuria index nocturnal urinary volume per 24hour urine volume). associations between nocturnal polyuria and various demographic, clinical and sleep related parameters were determined. results: overall 55% of the participants had nocturnal polyuria. multivariable regression analysis revealed that age, body mass index, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, time spent in bed and duration of first uninterrupted sleep were independent correlates of nocturnal polyuria. participants with a larger nocturnal excretion reported a shorter duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void and worse sleep quality despite spending similar time in bed. conclusions: body mass index, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/ angiotensin receptor blockers, time in bed and duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void are independently associated with nocturnal polyuria in older women with urge urinary incontinence, and are potentially modifiable. these findings also confirm the association between sleep and nocturnal polyuria. further studies should explore whether interventions to reduce nocturnal polyuria and/or increase the duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void would help to improve sleep quality in this population and thereby reduce or eliminate the need for sedative hypnotics.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundsleep disturbances are well-documented among persons with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). difficulty in falling asleep, shorter sleep time, frequent arousal and awakenings, or non-restorative sleep are the most common manifestations. sleep disturbances are also related to a higher risk of having ibs. some researchers have provided evidence of a positive association between poorer subjective sleep quality and increased severity and frequency in gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms in those with ibs. however, findings from studies using objective sleep and activity measures, such as polysomnography and actigraphy, are inconclusive. purposethis systematic review of the literature between 1990 and 2015 evaluates the evidence of sleep disturbances in adults with ibs and their relationship with gi symptoms.
polycythemia_vera	chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml) is a unique disease entity with overlap components of both myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasms. cmml is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm characterized by monocytosis, cytopenias, and extramedullary manifestations such as splenomegaly. the disease is rare and has undergone revisions in its classification. we review the recent classification strategies as well as diagnostic criteria, focusing on the new insights into the genetic alterations and unique pathophysiology of the disease. we also discuss the latest molecular characterization of the disease, including how molecular factors affect current prognostic models. finally, we focus on available treatment strategies, with a special emphasis on experimental and forthcoming therapies.

atrial_fibrillation	background: direct oral anticoagulants (doacs) share many indications with warfarin but require less frequent follow-up and monitoring. there is limited data available on the prescribing of doacs and appropriate laboratory monitoring in a real-world clinical setting. objective: to determine if patients receiving care at 2 university of florida (uf) health internal medicine clinics are prescribed doacs according to food and drug administration (fda)-approved labeling. secondary objectives were to determine the percentage of patients receiving appropriate baseline laboratory tests prior to doac initiation and the frequency of laboratory monitoring. methods: this retrospective chart review evaluated patients enrolled at 2 uf health internal medicine practices within the uf health system who were prescribed a doac between april 2014 and april 2015. adherence to fda-approved dosing recommendations and baseline laboratory tests were compared to previously published data. this study was approved by the uf institutional review board. results: a total of 194 patients met inclusion criteria. ninety-six patients (49.5%) were on a doac prior to data collection; 98 patients (50.5%) started a doac during data collection. of the 194 patients, 155 (79.9%) were prescribed doacs per fda-approved labeling (p = .0005); 79 (40.8%) obtained a complete blood count, serum creatinine, and liver function tests prior to doac initiation. conclusions: prescribing practices were significantly better than published data; however, 1 in 5 patients were not prescribed a doac according to fda-approved labeling. less than half of the patients started on a doac obtained the recommended labs prior to medication initiation.
smoking_cessation	objective: interventions are required to redress the disproportionate tobacco-related health burden experienced by persons with a mental illness. this study aimed to assess the efficacy of a universal smoking cessation intervention initiated within an acute psychiatric inpatient setting and continued post-discharge in reducing smoking prevalence and increasing quitting behaviours. method: a randomised controlled trial was undertaken across four psychiatric inpatient facilities in australia. participants (n = 754) were randomised to receive either usual care (n = 375) or an intervention comprising a brief motivational interview and self-help material while in hospital, followed by a 4-month pharmacological and psychosocial intervention (n=379) upon discharge. primary outcomes assessed at 6 and 12 months post-discharge were 7-day point prevalence and 1-month prolonged smoking abstinence. a number of secondary smoking-related outcomes were also assessed. subgroup analyses were conducted based on psychiatric diagnosis, baseline readiness to quit and nicotine dependence. results: seven-day point prevalence abstinence was higher for intervention participants (15.8%) than controls (9.3%) at 6 months post-discharge (odds ratio= 1.07, p=0.04), but not at 12 months (13.4% and 10.0%, respectively; odds ratio = 1.03, p = 0.25). significant intervention effects were not found on measures of prolonged abstinence at either 6 or 12 months post-discharge. differential intervention effects for the primary outcomes were not detected for any subgroups. at both 6 and 12 months post-discharge, intervention group participants were significantly more likely to smoke fewer cigarettes per day, have reduced cigarette consumption by and to have made at least one quit attempt, relative to controls. conclusions: universal smoking cessation treatment initiated in inpatient psychiatry and continued post-discharge was efficacious in increasing 7-day point prevalence smoking cessation rates and related quitting behaviours at 6 months post discharge, with sustained effects on quitting behaviour at 12 months. further research is required to identify strategies for achieving longer term smoking cessation.
lymphoma	aims: to characterize the clinicopathological and genetic features of pleomorphic mantle cell lymphoma (pmcl), which morphologically mimics diffuse large b cell lymphoma (dlbcl). methods and results: we screened systematically 500 b cell lymphomas morphologically compatible with dlbcl using an immunohistochemical algorithm of three markers (cd5, cyclin d1 and sox11). ten cases of pmcl were identified for further study and, surprisingly, four (40%) of them were cyclin d1-negative. these 10 patients were mainly elderly males with advanced disease, and their median survival was only 11 months. all cyclin d1-positive pmcls tested showed an igh-ccnd1 translocation, whereas one of the four cyclin d1-negative pmcls had a translocation involving ccnd2 and a high ccnd2 mrna level (p < 0.000001). the genomewide copy number profiles of both cyclin d1-positive and cyclin d1negative pmcls were similar to those of classical mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) reported previously, confirming the diagnosis. secondary genetic alterations involved in oncogenic pathways of mcl were observed more frequently in these pmcls, possibly decreasing the dependence on the driving ccnd1 translocation and accounting for the common cyclin d1 negativity. copy number gains of pik3ca and ccdc50 were detected in all cyclin d1-negative pmcls but in only 40% of the cyclin d1-positive pmcls. these additional oncogenic signals may compensate for the common absence of ccnd2 translocation in cyclin d1-negative pmcl. conclusion: we demonstrate for the first time that cyclin d1 negativity is surprisingly common in pmcl morphologically mimicking dlbcl, and the use of a simple immunohistochemical algorithm can prevent misclassification and inappropriate treatment.
asthma	patients with severe asthma represent a minority of the total asthma population, but carry a majority of the morbidity and healthcare costs. achieving better asthma control in this group of patients is therefore of key importance. systematic assessment of patients with possible severe asthma to identify treatment barriers and triggers of asthma symptoms, including co-morbidities, improves asthma control and reduces healthcare costs and is recommended by international guidelines on management of severe asthma. this review provides the clinician with an overview of the prevalence and clinical impact of the most common co-morbidities in severe asthma, including chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, allergic rhinitis, dysfunctional breathing, vocal cord dysfunction, anxiety and depression, obesity, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (osas), gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), bronchiectasis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa) and eosinophilic granulomatous with polyangiitis (egpa). furthermore, the review offers a summary of recommended diagnostic and management approaches for each co-morbidity. finally, the review links co-morbid conditions to specific phenotypes of severe asthma, in order to guide the clinician on which co-morbidities to look for in specific patients.
bipolar_disorder	background: sociodemographic factors, alcohol and drug intake, and maternal health are known to be associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy for women with severe mental illness in addition to their use of psychotropic medication. in this study, we describe the demographic characteristics of women hospitalized for severe mental illness along with their use of medication and other drugs during the pregnancy period. methods: a clinical case note review of women with psychosis who were hospitalized at the state psychiatric hospital in western australia during 1966-1996, gave birth between 1980 and 1992, and received psychiatric treatment during the pregnancy period. the mother 's clinical information was available from the case notes and the midwives record. the demographic characteristics of the mothers were described together with their hospitalization pattern and their medication and substance use during the pregnancy period. results: a total of 428 mothers with a history of severe mental illness were identified who gave birth during 1980-1992. of these, 164 mothers received psychiatric care during the pregnancy period. one hundred thirty-two had taken psychotropic medication during this period. mothers who were married, of aboriginal status or living in regional and remote areas appeared less likely to be hospitalized during the pregnancy period, while older mothers and those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were more likely to be hospitalized. the number of mothers taking psychotropic medication in the first trimester of pregnancy was reduced compared to the previous 6 months. the decline in the number taking substances over the same period was not significant. in all, 16% of the women attempted suicide during the pregnancy period and 10% non-suicidal self-injury. conclusion: the women demonstrate a pattern of decreased use of psychotropic medication use from the period before pregnancy to the first trimester of pregnancy. our data highlight the importance of women with severe mental illness receiving regular ongoing monitoring and support from their psychiatrist during pregnancy regarding the level of medication required as well as counseling with regard to substance use, non-suicidal self-injury, and attempted suicide.
crohn's_disease	methotrexate is an efficacious immunosuppressant for induction and maintenance of remission in crohn 's disease. the goal of this pilot study was to determine whether total or individual methotrexate glutamate levels (mtxglu(n)) in red blood cells correlate with disease activity and adverse events in crohn 's disease. a cross-sectional study was undertaken with 12 patients on a stable dose of 25 mg weekly methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous). clinical disease activity was assessed by the harvey-bradshaw index (hbi), and biologic disease activity was measured by inflammatory markers. concentrations of individual mtxglu(n) levels were measured in red blood cells (rbcs) using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. no association was observed between rbc individual (mtxglu(n)) or total methotrexate glutamate concentrations and clinical disease activity (hbi score) or inflammatory markers or adverse events. although crohn 's disease patients in remission appeared to generally have higher rbc total longer-chain methotrexate polyglutamate (mtxglu(3+4+5)) concentrations compared with those with active disease, a definitive association between rbc mtxglu(3+4+5) levels and clinical disease activity could not be established. larger longitudinal studies in patients with diverse disease activity are needed to establish the value of mtxglu(n) levels as indicators of treatment efficacy and clinical outcome.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), the most common form of chronic interstitial lung disease, is a severe progressive fibrotic disorder of unknown aetiology. the disease has a heterogeneous clinical course, with frequent poor prognosis, similar to malignant disease. correctly diagnosing ipf has become particularly important in view of the availability of more precise therapeutic indications, thus avoiding steroid treatment and allowing new approaches with novel drugs. to date we have limited information about biomarkers predictive of progressive disease and associated complications. efforts should be made in the future to more appropriately study lung tissue and then to extrapolate the most clinically fitting biomarkers. this approach is already used in routine management of many cancers and provides a potential road map for more appropriate clinical care of ipf. this review will mainly focus on histology and etiopathogenesis highlighting some morphological and molecular features that may influence the overall management of ipf.
mental_health	objectivethe aim of this research was to explore the transition pathways of transition-aged youth out of child and adolescent mental health services in perth, western australia. a secondary aim was to identify factors that have some impact upon the transition process. methodcases discharged from seven child and adolescent mental health community clinics in the perth metropolitan area, from 1 june 2004 to 30 june 2013, at transition age (16-25 years of age), were examined retrospectively. two hundred and forty-five cases met the selection criteria and were reviewed on the psychiatric services online information system. resultsfour specific pathways of referral and acceptance into an adult mental health service were identified: not referred, referred with immediate engagement, referred with delayed engagement, and referred with no engagement and not accepted. principal discharge diagnosis, length of stay, and housing situation on discharge were all found to influence likelihood of referral. only principal discharge diagnosis was found to influence successful acceptance into an adult mental health service. conclusionsthe factors found to influence transition pathways in the present study were largely consistent with findings from the uk. findings of the present research can assist clinicians to make more informed decisions when discussing transition with clients. more broadly, findings can be used by policy makers to support the formation and maintenance of transition protocols.
dementia	background: the relative performance of semi-quantitative amyloid positron emission tomography (pet) and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) markers in diagnosing alzheimer 's disease (ad) and predicting the cognitive evolution of patients with mild cognitive impairment (mci) is still debated. methods: subjects from the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative 2 with complete baseline cognitive assessment (mini mental state examination, clinical dementia rating [cdr] and alzheimer 's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale [adas-cog] scores), csf collection (amyloid-beta(1-42) [a beta], tau and phosphorylated tau) and f-18-florbetapir scans were included in our cross-sectional cohort. among these, patients with mci or substantial memory complaints constituted our longitudinal cohort and were followed for 30 +/- 16 months. pet amyloid deposition was quantified using relative retention indices (standardised uptake value ratio [suvr]) with respect to pontine, cerebellar and composite reference regions. diagnostic and prognostic performance based on pet and csf was evaluated using roc analysis, multivariate linear regression and survival analysis with the cox proportional hazards model. results: the cross-sectional study included 677 participants and revealed that pontine and composite suvr values were better classifiers (auc 0.88, diagnostic accuracy 85%) than csf markers (auc 0.83 and 0.85, accuracy 80% and 75%, for a beta and tau, respectively). suvr was a strong independent determinant of cognition in multivariate regression, whereas a beta was not; tau was also a determinant, but to a lesser degree. among the 396 patients from the longitudinal study, 82 (21%) converted to ad within 22 +/- 13 months. optimal suvr thresholds to differentiate ad converters were quite similar to those of the cross-sectional study. composite suvr was the best ad classifier (auc 0.86, sensitivity 88%, specificity 81%). in multivariate regression, baseline cognition (cdr and adas-cog) was the main predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. pontine and composite suvr were moderate but independent predictors of final status and cdr/adas-cog progression rate, whereas baseline csf markers had a marginal influence. the adjusted hrs for ad conversion were 3.8 (p = 0.01) for pet profile, 1.2 (p=ns) for a beta profile and 1.8 (p = 0.03) for tau profile. conclusions: semi-quantitative amyloid pet appears more powerful than csf markers for ad grading and mci prognosis in terms of cognitive decline and ad conversion.
rheumatoid_arthritis	purposemedication error is a significant source of morbidity and mortality among patients. clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence are required for the implementation of quality of care interventions. reduction of error-related cost is a key potential benefit of interventions addressing medication error. the aim of this review was to describe and quantify the economic burden associated with medication error. methodspubmed, cochrane, embase, cinahl, econlit, abi/inform, business source complete were searched. studies published 2004-2016 assessing the economic impact of medication error were included. cost values were expressed in euro 2015. a narrative synthesis was performed. resultsa total of 4572 articles were identified from database searching, and 16 were included in the review. one study met all applicable quality criteria. fifteen studies expressed economic impact in monetary terms. mean cost per error per study ranged from euro2.58 to euro111727.08. healthcare costs were used to measure economic impact in 15 of the included studies with one study measuring litigation costs. four studies included costs incurred in primary care with the remaining 12 measuring hospital costs. five studies looked at general medication error in a general population with 11 studies reporting the economic impact of an individual type of medication error or error within a specific patient population. conclusionsconsiderable variability existed between studies in terms of financial cost, patients, settings and errors included. many were of poor quality. assessment of economic impact was conducted predominantly in the hospital setting with little assessment of primary care impact. limited parameters were used to establish economic impact. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
osteoporosis	icariin (ica) is a pharmacologically active flavonoid glycoside that shows promise in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis (op). however, the mechanisms underlying the anti-osteoporotic effects of ica remain largely unclear. the present study used quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot and immunohistochemical analysis to examine the effects of ica on several key targets in the notch signaling pathway in bone tissue in ovariectomized rats. it was observed that ica has a pronounced beneficial effect on op rats and inhibits the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar), ccaat/enhancer binding protein (c/ebp) and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (fabp4) mrna. in addition, it was identified that ica downregulates the expression of notch1 intracellular domain (n1icd) and jagged1 proteins in bone tissue, and suppresses the effect of n1icd on notch2 mrna expression. it is proposed that ica inhibits the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes by inhibiting the expression of ppar, c/ebp and fabp4 mrna via the notch signaling pathway. in addition, it is proposed that ica inhibits the expression of notch2 mrna by suppressing the effect of n1icd. in conclusion, the results provide further mechanistic evidence for the clinical efficacy of ica in the treatment of op.
medicare	purpose. the effectiveness and financial benefit of pharmacist-led annual wellness visits (awvs) in conjunction with comprehensive medication management (cmm) for older, high-risk patients were examined. methods. eligible patients were 65 years of age or older with three or more chronic medical conditions, taking five or more long-term prescription or nonprescription medications and receiving primary care in a retirement community clinic. the intervention involved two components, an awv and cmm. the awv included all medicare-required components. all participants saw a clinical pharmacist practitioner for an awv with cmm and additional cmm visits at three and six months. outcomes included completion of required awv components, prevalence of medication-related problems (mrps), classic return on investment, patient satisfaction, and change in rate of hospitalization. results. of the 60 eligible patients contacted, 53 (88%) agreed to participate. patients' mean +/- s.d. age was 82.1 +/- 5.5 years, and patients used a median of 12 medications (range, 5-27) at baseline. the pharmacist identified at least 1 mrp in 90.6% of patients at the awv; all patients had at least 1 mrp identified over six months. a total of 278 mrps were identified: suboptimal drug (32.7%), insufficient therapeutic monitoring (25.2%), undertreatment of chronic condition (16.9%), and suboptimal dose, frequency, or administration (15.8%). revenue generated by the pharmacist exceeded costs by 38.1%. the rate of hospitalizations did not significantly change after the intervention. conclusion. pharmacists played a beneficial role in the provision of both awvs and cmm, facilitating the completion of wellness visits and identifying and addressing mrps in an older, high-risk population.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective: the aim of this study is to investigate the relation between vitamin d levels, vertebral defoi functional status, quality of life, acute phase reactants and enthesopathy in patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa). patients and methods: fifty-two patients with psa and 52 controls were enrolled to the study. routine blood tests and serums 25-(oh)d3 were measured. the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae deformities identified in the radiographies were evaluated by a radiologist. psoriatic arthritis quality of life (psaqol) was used for evaluating quality of life and disease activity parameters for psa were assessed. in psa patients, correlations was performed between the 25(oh)-d3 levels and pga (patient global assessment), phga (physician global assessment), tender jc (joint count), haq-s (health assessment questionnaire for the sp ondyloarthropathies), psaqol, mases (maastricht ankylosing spondylitis enthesitis score) and basdai (bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index) values. results: the results showed that 25(oh)-d3 levels was not correlated with these values. (p>0.05 for r = -0.171, r = -0.167, r=-0.069, r=-0.236, r=-0.062, r= -0.058 and r = -0.106 respectively). it was determined that the psaqol score had a positive and statistically significant correlation with the pga, swollen jc, crp, hgd, tender jc, vas -pain, haq-s, mases and basdai values in psa patients. (p>0.05 for r=0.291, r=0.324, r=0.346, r=0.312; and p=0.001 for r=0.472, r=0.380, r=0.565, r=0.696, r=0.359, r=0.633, respectively) statistical analyses demonstrated that psa patients with vertebral deformities had higher numbers of tender joints, more prolonged periods of morning stiffness, higher das28-esr (disease activity score) scores, and higher levels of vitamin d (p<0.05, p<0.05, p=0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). the multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the only factor which had an effect on the development of vertebral deformities was the use of steroids. conclusions: this result has demonstrated that psoriatic arthritis has a considerable effect on patient quality of life. most significant factors that affecting quality of life were physical pain and disability while vertebral deformities and 25-(oh)d3 had no significant effect.
addiction	background: this study aimed to identify the most important factors of changing pattern of drug abuse from opium to methamphetamine in iranian drugdependent women. materials and methods: this study was a phenomenological study. the data were analyzed by the 7-step colaizzi method. subjects selected from patients who were referred to addiction rehabilitation residential center of welfare organization in bojnurd city located in northeast iran. results: we found 8 conceptual classes, and 32 codes from the analysis of data. the individual factors were as follow: elevation of mood, obtaining more pleasure, increasing energy and improving performance, relief of physical pain, and sensation seeking. conclusions: depth review and analyses of interviews revealed that individual factors are the most important factor in crystal meth abuse.
atopic_dermatitis	background: canine atopic dermatitis is a common pruritic skin disease often treated with allergen immunotherapy (ait). ait in dogs traditionally begins with attempting to identify clinically relevant environmental allergens. current allergen testing methodologies and immunotherapy techniques in dogs are not standardized. immunotherapy with a mixture of allergenic extracts selected based on regional aerobiology rather than intradermal tests or serum ige assays has been described. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of regionally-specific immunotherapy in dogs with atopic dermatitis. the medical records of a veterinary dermatology referral clinic were searched for dogs with atopic dermatitis that began regionally-specific subcutaneous immunotherapy from june, 2010 to may, 2013. an overall assessment of treatment effectiveness (excellent, good, fair, or poor) was assigned based upon changes in pruritus severity, lesion severity, and the reduction in concurrent medication(s) during a follow-up period of at least 270 days. baseline characteristics that might predict treatment success were analyzed with the spearman 's correlation and the kruskal-wallis tests. results: of the 286 dogs that began regionally-specific immunotherapy (respit) during a 3 year period, 103 met the inclusion criteria. the overall response to respit was classified as excellent in 19%, good in 38%, fair in 25%, and poor in 18% of dogs. the response classification correlated significantly with a reduction in pruritus severity (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) and lesion severity (r = 0.54, p < 0.001), but not with the dogs' baseline characteristics. adverse reactions were reported in 7/286 (2.4%) of treated dogs. conclusions: under the conditions of this study, respit was safe and effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs.
digestive_health	as a dietary source, the foliage of eucalyptus spp. is low in available protein and carbohydrate while containing polyphenolic compounds that interfere with enzymatic digestion. to overcome this, the koala (phascolarctos cinereus) has evolved a range of anatomical and physiological adaptations to assist with digestion and absorption of nutrients from this food source. microbial fermentation of partially digested eucalyptus leaves is thought to be critical in this process, however, little is known about the composition and diversity of microorganisms that are associated with digestive health in this native species. in this study, we performed 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing of caecum, colon and faecal pellet samples from two wild, free ranging, queensland koalas. our results reveal a highly complex and diverse ecosystem with considerable intra-individual variation. although samples were dominated by sequences from the bacteroidetes and firmicutes phyla there was considerable variation at the genus level. this study is the first non-culture based microbiota analysis, using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing, and provides preliminary data to expand our understanding of the koala hindgut.

healthy_sleep	healthy sleep is essential in children 's cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development. however, remarkably little is known about the influence of sleep disorders on different memory processes in childhood. such data could give us a deeper insight into the effect of sleep on the developing brain and memory functions and how the relationship between sleep and memory changes from childhood to adulthood. in the present study we examined the effect of sleep disorder on declarative and non-declarative memory consolidation by testing children with sleep-disordered breathing (sdb) which is characterized by disrupted sleep structure. we used a story recall task to measure declarative memory and alternating serial reaction time (asrt) task to assess nondeclarative memory. this task enables us to measure two aspects of non-declarative memory, namely general motor skill learning and sequence-specific learning. there were two sessions: a learning phase and a testing phase, separated by a 12 h offline period with sleep. our data showed that children with sdb exhibited a generally lower declarative memory performance both in the learning and testing phase; however, both the sdb and control groups exhibited retention of the previously recalled items after the offline period. here we showed intact non declarative consolidation in sdb group in both sequence-specific and general motor skill. these findings suggest that sleep disorders in childhood have a differential effect on different memory processes (online vs. offline) and give us insight into how sleep disturbances affects developing brain.
anxiety	the entire himalayan region is prone to disasters, with many people being vulnerable to hydroclimatic threats such as extreme rainfall-driven floods, glacial lake outburst floods (glofs), landslide lake outburst floods (llofs), and landslides triggered by rainfall. landslides and floods are related, as the former cause the lakes that burst, and floods can undercut slopes and cause landslides. during the past 200 years, landslides and floods caused by llofs in the garhwal himalaya have occurred in 1894,1970, and 1978; but the most disastrous event, in terms of loss of life and economic impact, occurred in june 2013, which was a result of extreme rainfall in the higher himalaya and breaching of a moraine-dammed lake, very short-lived llofs, and rainfall-induced runoff and landslides. outmigration from the area as a result of the 2013 event has caused anxiety about the future of the economy and also concerns about security of a state that has an international border. as a contribution to planning and reconstruction to secure the livelihoods of the local people and to entice migrants to return, this paper identifies zones in the mandakini valley susceptible to landslides using a 'weights of evidence' approach. the roles of climate, geology, and geomorphology of the valley are also given attention to explain the reasons for the disastrous event of june 2013. the results of the research presented here may be an important input to disaster governance.

psoriasis	background: psoriasis is a chronic condition with negative impact on patients' quality of life that most often requires lifelong effective and safe treatment. objective: this analysis focused on the effect of secukinumab treatment on patient-reported health-related quality of life as assessed by the dermatology life quality index (dlqi) in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. methods: the proportion of subjects achieving dlqi score 0/1 response at week 24, time to dlqi score 0/1 response, and sustained dlqi score 0/1 response up to week 52 were compared between secukinumab and etanercept. results: of 1470 subjects, 1144 received secukinumab and 326 received etanercept. dlqi score 0/1 response rates were significantly higher for secukinumab than for etanercept at week 24. the median time to dlqi score 0/1 response was significantly shorter for secukinumab versus etanercept (12 vs 24 weeks; p < .01). the majority of secukinumab-treated subjects achieved dlqi score 0/1 response at week 24 and sustained it through week 52 along with a 90% to 100% reduction in the psoriasis area and severity index total score response. limitations: placebo comparisons are limited during the maintenance period because of rerandomization at week 12. conclusion: secukinumab treatment provided faster and greater sustained improvements in quality of life than etanercept over 52 weeks, consistent with greater clinical response.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a chronic inflammatory disease mainly affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. macrophage migration inhibitory (mif) factor is a regulatory cytokine that inhibits random immune cell migration. mif gene promoter polymorphisms play a role in the progression of several inflammatory disorders. aims: to investigate the relationship between the mif gene -173 g/c single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) and as. study design: cross-sectional study. methods: in this study, a total of 161 as and 194 normal controls were recruited. the mif gene -173 g/c snp was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. results: there was no significant difference between groups in terms of genotype distribution (p>0.05). when wild-type g/g and g/c+ c/c genotypes are compared in terms of clinical characteristics, there is a significant difference between the average age and the duration of disease in as patients (p<0.05). conclusion: no significant relationship between as disease and mif -173 g/c polymorphism was found. mif -173 g/c polymorphism (c allele) may affect the time of onset and the duration of disease in as patients.
children's_health	background: school nurses can provide direct services for children with asthma, educate, and reinforce treatment recommendations to children and their families, and coordinate the school-wide response to students' asthma emergencies. unfortunately, school-based health services today depend on an unreliable patchwork of funding. limited state and local funds lead to extremely low nurse-to-student ratios, resulting in missed opportunities for prevention and care of asthma and other health conditions. methods: we carried out a nonsystematic review of legal, government, private health foundation, and medical literature. results: many health services for asthma and other conditions provided in school settings are services typically covered by medicaid and the children 's health insurance program (chip) when offered in other settings. however, complex reimbursement rules, questionable policy guidance establishing a ""free care rule,'' and other barriers have limited the ability of schools to seek medicaid/chip reimbursement for these services. recent legal developments may help overcome some of these barriers, and new flexibilities in medicaid law bring opportunities for increased reimbursement of school-based health services. conclusions: policymakers should call on the centers for medicare and medicaid services to abandon the ""free care rule'' and issue other guidance that would enable schools to appropriately obtain medicaid reimbursement for nursing services.
stress_management	health care workers in the community mental health (mh) and alcohol and other drugs (aod) sectors face complex psychological issues that exact a heavy emotional toll. burnout is a significant risk for these workers. stress management, developing effective work practices and the implementation of burnout interventions are crucial in both engaging and retaining staff. the present study (non-randomized) investigates the effects of a targeted 6-week emotion regulation and mindfulness training program (ceb) in educators and mental health workers. participants who completed ceb training (n = 20) demonstrated a significant improvement in mindfulness and a significant increase in emotional awareness when compared to the control group (n = 20). assessments were made at baseline, directly after training (in ceb trained group only) and at 6 months post training completion. this change persisted at 6 months after completing the training. these results suggest that embedding ceb training within a higher education curriculum may have a long-term positive impact on students and health care workers planning to enter the mh aod sector. further research is required.

hiv_aids	objectives: the aim of this study was to compare plasma biomarkers of coagulation between hiv-infected individuals and hiv-uninfected controls and to assess the impact of disturbances in coagulation on neurocognitive functioning in hiv. design: a cross-sectional study of 66 antiretroviral therapy treated, virally suppressed, hiv-infected and 34 hiv-uninfected older (>= 50 years of age) adults. methods: participants completed standardized neurobehavioral and neuromedical assessments. neurocognitive functioning was evaluated using a well validated comprehensive neuropsychological battery. plasma biomarkers associated with procoagulation (fibrinogen, p-selectin, tissue factor and von willebrand factor), anticoagulation (antithrombin, protein c and thrombomodulin), fibrinolysis (d-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and plasminogen) were collected. multivariable linear regression was used to test the interaction of hiv and coagulation on neurocognitive functioning. results: most participants were male (78.0%) and non-hispanic white (73.0%) with a mean age of 57.8 years. among hiv-infected participants, mean estimated duration of hiv infection was 19.4 years and median current cd4(+) cell count was 654 cells/ ml. levels of soluble biomarkers of procoagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolysis were comparable between the hiv serostatus groups. coagulation and hiv had an interacting effect on neurocognitive functioning, such that greater coagulation imbalance was associated with poorer neurocognitive functioning among the hiv-infected participants. the moderating effect of coagulation on neurocognition was driven by procoagulant but not anticoagulant or fibrinolytic biomarkers. conclusions: elevated levels of procoagulants may exert a particularly detrimental effect on neurocognitive functioning among older hiv-infected persons. a better understanding of the specific role of coagulation in the cause of hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders may lead to treatments aimed at reducing coagulopathy, thereby improving neurocognitive outcomes. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
migraine	although it is still debated whether vasoconstriction underlies migraine resolution by triptans, they are not recommended in patients at cardiovascular risk. however, relationship between stroke incidence and triptan use is unclear, and it is unknown whether acute or chronic use of these drugs worsens ischemic brain injury. to address this issue, we investigated the effect of clinically-relevant doses of the potent cerebral artery vasoconstrictor eletriptan on cerebral blood flow (cbf) and brain infarct volumes, as well as on expression of genes involved in cerebrovascular regulation. we report that acute treatment of rats or mice with eletriptan did not reduce basal cbf, which promptly dropped upon treatment with prazosin or dihydroergotamine. acute of chronic (1 month) eletriptan also did not affect cbf changes and infarct volumes in mice undergoing brain ischemia/reperfusion. finally, chronic eletriptan reduced brain mrnas for pacap and vip, leaving unaffected those for 5ht1(b/d)r and cgrp. no significant transcript changes were found in dura mater. data suggest that the impact of triptans on cerebral hemodynamic should be re-evaluated, as well as their propensity to increase stroke risk in migraineurs.

osteoarthritis	the menisci of the knees are semicircular fibrocartilaginous structures consisting of a hydrophilic extracellular matrix containing a network of collagen fibers, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans maintained by a cellular component. the menisci are responsible for more than 50% of load transmission across the knee and increase joint congruity thereby also aiding in fluid film lubrication of the joint. in the united kingdom, meniscal tears are the most common form of intra-articular knee injury and one of the commonest indications for orthopedic intervention. the management of these injuries is dependent on the location within the meniscus (relative to peripheral blood supply) and the pattern of tear. removal of meniscus is known to place the knee at increased risk of osteoarthritis; therefore repair of meniscal tears is preferable. however, a significant proportion of tears are irreparable and can only be treated by partial or even complete meniscectomy. more recent studies have shown encouraging results with meniscal replacement in this situation, though further work is required in this area.
hereditary_angioedema	hereditary angioedema with normal c1-esterase inhibitor (hae-nc1inh) perioperative is a rare condition which could have potential disastrous ramifications for the anesthesiologist in the perioperative period. however, there is limited evidence and/or guidelines on the optimal way to manage these patients. we present the case of a patient with hae-nc1inh who was successfully managed in the perioperative period with plasma derived cl-esterase inhibitor (pdc1inh). a 29-year-old woman with a diagnosis of hae-nc1inh presented to the preoperative consultation in preparation for an upcoming total thyroidectomy. she had a 14-year history of ongoing lip and facial edema sometimes necessitating emergency department visitation. close consultation with her immunologist, transfusion medicine specialists, and anesthesia care providers allowed for a preoperative plan to provide the patient adequate prophylaxis. both pdc1inh and tranexamic acid were given preoperatively. the patient underwent surgery with no complications. a multi-disciplinary team of clinical immunologists, transfusion medicine specialists, and anesthesiologists facilitated the successful perioperative management of a patient with hae-nc1inh; pdc1inh may a suitable prophylactic perioperative therapy for this rare patient population.

kidney_health	macroautophagy is a highly evolutionally conserved degradation process by which cytosolic materials (including macromolecules such as proteins and lipids) and damaged organelles are broken down to their basic components. the role of autophagy is not only the elimination of materials, but it also serves as a dynamic recycling system that produces new components and energy for cellular renovation and homeostasis. the association of autophagy with the organ physiology and pathogenesis of various disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, infection and inflammatory bowel disease has been revealed in recent years. autophagy also plays an essential role in cellular homeostasis in kidney and counteracts age-related stress and kidney diseases. here, we critically review the current evidence regarding autophagy in the kidney, in particular as assessed with tissue- or cell lineage-specific autophagy-deficient mice. better insight into the mechanisms underlying renoprotective roles of autophagy will pave the way toward novel therapies for kidney diseases.
autism	next-generation sequencing led to the identification of many potential novel disease genes. the presence of mutations in the same gene in multiple unrelated patients is, however, a priori insufficient to establish that these genes are truly involved in the respective disease. here, we show how phenotype information can be incorporated within statistical approaches to provide additional evidence for the causality of mutations. we developed a broadly applicable statistical model that integrates gene-specific mutation rates, cohort size, mutation type, and phenotype frequency information to assess the chance of identifying de novo mutations affecting the same gene in multiple patients with shared phenotype features. we demonstrate our approach based on the frequency of phenotype features present in a unique cohort of 6,149 patients with intellectual disability. we show that our combined approach can decrease the number of patients required to identify novel disease genes, especially for patients with combinations of rare phenotypes. in conclusion, we show how integrating genotype-phenotype information can aid significantly in the interpretation of de novo mutations in potential novel disease genes.
