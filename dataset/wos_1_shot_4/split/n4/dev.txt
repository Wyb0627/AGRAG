molecular_biology	culture-based pathogen identification in skull base osteomyelitis, particularly for fungi, is often inaccurate. we report the case of patient with fungal skull base osteomyelitis cured by sustained antifungal therapy after 16 months of debilitating illness. due to medical complications, a strong clinical rationale was needed to justify long-term antifungal therapy. the offending fungus was identified by experimental molecular technology (ibis t5000 universal biosensor); invasive fungal disease was corroborated by biochemical assays. our discussion will help familiarize the otolaryngologist with existing biochemical and molecular diagnostics for invasive fungal disease. we encourage future investigators to study their application in cases of skull base osteomyelitis.
enzymology	a thermostable amidase produced by geobacillus subterraneus rl-2a was purified to homogeneity, with a yield of 9.54 % and a specific activity of 48.66 u mg(-1). the molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 111 kda. the amidase of g. subterraneus rl-2a is constitutive in nature, active at a broad range of ph (4.5-11.5) and temperature (40-90 a degrees c) and has a half-life of 5 h and 54 min at 70 a degrees c. inhibition of enzyme activity was observed in the presence of metal ions, such as co2+, hg2+, cu2+, ni2+, and thiol reagents. the presence of mid-chain aliphatic and amino acid amides enhances the enzymatic activity. the acyl transferase activity was detected with propionamide, butyramide and nicotinamide. the enzyme showed moderate stability toward toluene, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, ethylene glycol except acetone, ethanol, butanol, propanol and dimethyl sulfoxide. the k (m) and v (max) of the purified amidase with nicotinamide were 6.02 +/- a 0.56 mm and 132.6 +/- a 4.4 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein by analyzing michaelis-menten kinetics. the results of maldi-tof analysis indicated that this amidase has homology with the amidase of geobacillus sp. c56-t3 (gi|297530427). it is the first reported wide-spectrum thermostable amidase from a thermophilic g. subterraneus.
southern_blotting	to investigate the basis of susceptibility to phenicols and oxazolidinones of the porcine enterococcus faecalis cppf5 despite the presence of the multiresistance gene cfr. southern blotting, conjugation and transformation analyses were conducted to confirm the plasmid location and transferability of cfr in cppf5. the genetic environment of cfr was determined by sequence analysis. transcription and translation of cfr were examined by rtpcr and western blotting, respectively, and modifications at a2503 within the 23s rrna sequence were identified by primer extension. electrotransformation and southern blotting indicated that cppf5 and its transformant 5b2-3 contained two cfr-carrying plasmids 50 and 12 kb in size. the complete 12270 bp sequence of the smaller plasmid, pcppf5, was determined and shared 99.9 (12269/12270 bp) identity with the corresponding region of the cfr-carrying plasmid pef-01 in e. faecalis of cattle origin. moreover, the genetic environment of cfr in the 50 kb plasmid was the same as that in pcppf5 according to sequencing results. although cfr mrna, cfr protein and a modification at the a2503 site were detected, the cfr-carrying transformant 5b2-3 did not have elevated mics of chloramphenicol, florfenicol and linezolid, indicating that cfr fails to mediate resistance to the respective antibiotics in e. faecalis. this is the first report of the cfr gene failing to elevate mics of the corresponding antibiotics. although the genetic basis for the apparent no resistance phenotype remains to be determined, this finding may have implications for surveillance studies that target the cfr gene.
northern_blotting	backgound: beta-carotene exhibits biological activity as provitamin a. key step in vitamin a formation is the cleavage of beta-carotene to retinal by an enzyme designated as beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase (bcm). recently, it is reported that expression of bcm gene in the intestine is under feedback regulation by retinoic acid (ra). however, the regulation of bcm gene expression in various other tissues is still unknown. aim of the study: in the present study, we identified the full-length cdna encoding the rat bcm gene and investigated the regulation of its expression in several tissues by ra in the presence of vitamin a deficiency. methods: we cloned the full-length cdna encoding bcm gene from a rat intestinal cdna library by hybridization screening. the bcm gene expression was examined using northern blotting and reverse transcription-pcr analysis. we also investigated whether bcm gene expression was regulated by retinoids in several tissues of vitamin a-deficient rats. results: sequence analysis of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 1,701 bases encoding a protein of 566 amino acids. the predicted polypeptide showed 94%, 81%, and 66% identity with mouse, human, and chicken bcm, respectively. rat bcm mrna was highly expressed in the intestine and liver, while there was weak expression in the testes, kidneys, and lungs. immunoblotting revealed that rat bcm is a 64-kda protein. bcm gene expression was increased in the small intestine by vitamin a deficiency compared with that in rats on a control diet, while this upregulation was suppressed by all-trans ra (atra) or 9-cis ra (9-cis ra). bcm gene expression in the lungs and testes was also suppressed by atra or 9-cis ra in rats with vitamin a deficiency. however, hepatic bcm gene expression was only decreased by atra and renal expression was not affected by either retinoid. as the small intestine is the major site of beta-carotene conversion, intestinal bcm gene expression may be more tightly regulated. conclusion: these data suggest that bcm gene expression in several tissues may be down-regulated by ra at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal. to prevent an excess of retinol, homeostasis may occur at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal in several tissues.
human_metabolism	purpose of review wasting diseases are characterized by progressive deterioration of nutritional status that negatively influences patients' outcome. the better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of wasting may lead to effective therapies. tryptophan metabolism has unique features suggesting a critical role in influencing human metabolism under normal and pathological conditions. recent findings during disease, inflammatory response favours the local depletion of the essential amino acid tryptophan, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation. tryptophan depletion may also mediate immunotolerance to foreign antigens. in contrast, brain accumulation of tryptophan contributes to wasting by increasing oxidative stress and hypothalamic serotonin neurotransmission, and thereby triggering the onset of sickness behaviour followed by depressive-like behaviour. summary tryptophan metabolism is critical in mediating a number of important biological responses. restoring tryptophan metabolism may well result in enhanced recovery from disease.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: oridonin, the major terpene found in rabdosia rubescens (henmsl.) hara, is widely used as a dietary supplement and therapeutic drug. oridonin has been proven to possess good anti-tumour activity, but little is known about its effect on angiogenesis. the aim of this study was to investigate the antiangiogenic effects of oridonin in vivo and in vitro and prove that oridonin anti-tumour activity is based on suppressing angiogenesis. methods: in vitro, the antiangiogenesis effect was studied by proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and tube formation experiments on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (huvecs). in vivo, using the tg (fli1: gfp) zebrafish model, the embryonic vasculogenesis and postnatal regeneration were evaluated. the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) signalling pathway gene expressions were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). furthermore, the inhibition effects on tumour growth and metastasis were observed using a xenograft zebrafish tumour model and xenograft nude mouse tumour model. angiogenesis was assayed by immunostaining with cluster of differentiation 31. importantly, the proteins were identified as being differentially expressed in an in vivo model by two-dimensional electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (2d-ms) and western blot (wb). results: the results indicated that oridonin inhibited huvec proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation and induced cell apoptosis. oridonin inhibited zebrafish angiogenesis during embryonic development and tail fin regeneration. rt-pcr showed that oridonin decreased the vegfa, vegfr2, and vegfr3 expressions in zebrafish, while the tp53 expression increased. moreover, oridonin had strong effects on tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. 2d-ms identified a total of 50 proteins differentially expressed (17 up-expressed, 28 down-expressed). lastly, wb showed that claudin 1, claudin 4, and claudin 7 were closely related to tumour growth and metastasis. conclusion: this study demonstrated that oridonin could inhibit tumour growth and metastasis, which mainly based on oridonin antiangiogenic effects. claudin 1, claudin 4, and claudin 7 were the main contributors to the mechanism.
immunology	internal energy reserves of animals are limited, and the current investment in reproduction often decreases survival or future reproductive success. some studies showed that copulatory activities impair the strength of immune function in insects, while the recent evidence is contradictory. in this study we tested whether copulatory activity affects the rate of encapsulation response in males of calopteryx splendens damselfly in allopatric populations, and in sympatric populations where c. splendens stay together with their superior competitor c. virgo. we also counted the number of eugregarines, which are common parasites of damselflies. copulation activity did not affect the immunity of c. splendens males in allopatric populations. in sympatric populations c. splendens males had more gut parasites, and we found a significant interaction between parasite number and copulatory activity on the rate of encapsulation. our results suggest that the costs of reproduction are higher in infected males, which may affect reproductive investment and sexual selection.
genetics	microneurographic recordings of human muscle sympathetic nerve activity responses to sudden sensory stimuli (ie, arousal) have revealed 2 intraindividually reproducible response profiles in healthy young males that predict different neural and blood pressure responses to more sustained stress. approximately 50% of subjects inhibit muscle sympathetic nerve activity during arousal, whereas the remaining 50% do not, and the latter group displays a markedly greater blood pressure increase in response to arousal, as well as during and after 3 minutes of mental arithmetic. studying a group of monozygotic twins (10 pairs, 2 excluded from analysis), the aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of genetic determination of these sympathetic response profiles. muscle sympathetic burst incidence at rest was similar in twins, with a within-pair burst incidence ratio of 0.87 +/- 0.02 (sem) compared with 0.73 +/- 0.07 found in unrelated pairs (p= 0.002), confirming a previous study from our laboratory. in contrast, the sympathetic responses to arousal showed large twin within-pair variance (arousal inhibition ratio 0.56 +/- 0.11), which did not significantly differ (p= 0.939) from the variance in pairs of unrelated subjects (0.46 +/- 0.11). the finding that human muscle sympathetic nerve responses to arousal are less determined by genotype than the resting level of corresponding sympathetic nerve activity suggests that the arousal response pattern is more prone to be altered by environmental factors. this raises the possibility that these intraindividually reproducible sympathetic neural response profiles can be modified in a positive direction from a cardiovascular risk perspective.
cell_biology	phylogeny is often used to compare entire families of genes/proteins. we previously showed that classification of caenorhabditis elegans rho gtpases on the basis of their enzymatic properties was significantly different from sequence alignments. to further develop this concept, we have developed an integrated approach to classify c. elegans small gtpases based on functional data comprising affinity for gtp, sub-cellular localization, tissue distribution and silencing impact. this analysis led to establish a novel functional classification for small gtpases. to test the relevance of this classification in mammals, we focused our attention on the human orthologs of small gtpases from a specific group comprising arf- 1.2, evl-20, arl-1, y54e10br. 2, unc-108 and rab-7. we then tested their involvement in protein secretion and membrane traffic in mammalian systems. using this approach we identify a novel network containing 18 gtpases, and 23 functionally interacting proteins, conserved between c. elegans and mammals, which is involved in membrane traffic and protein secretion.
fluid_mechanics	there are 0.6-1.9% of us children who were born with congenital heart malformations. clinical and animal studies suggest that abnormal blood flow forces might play a role in causing these malformation, highlighting the importance of understanding the fetal cardiovascular fluid mechanics. we performed computational fluid dynamics simulations of the right ventricles, based on four-dimensional ultrasound scans of three 20-wk-old normal human fetuses, to characterize their flow and energy dynamics. peak intraventricular pressure gradients were found to be 0.2-0.9 mmhg during systole, and 0.1-0.2 mmhg during diastole. diastolic wall shear stresses were found to be around 1 pa, which could elevate to 2-4 pa during systole in the outflow tract. fetal right ventricles have complex flow patterns featuring two interacting diastolic vortex rings, formed during diastolic e wave and a wave. these rings persisted through the end of systole and elevated wall shear stresses in their proximity. they were observed to conserve similar to 25.0% of peak diastolic kinetic energy to be carried over into the subsequent systole. however, this carried-over kinetic energy did not significantly alter the work done by the heart for ejection. thus, while diastolic vortexes played a significant role in determining spatial patterns and magnitudes of diastolic wall shear stresses, they did not have significant influence on systolic ejection. our results can serve as a baseline for future comparison with diseased hearts.
hydraulics	gully erosion represents one of the most significant types of land degradation in the mediterranean areas, giving place to important on- and off-site effects. in this paper, a second-order gully located in sw spain is analyzed. along the gully, 28 cross-sections were established and measured with a leica tcrm1102 laser total station, approximately every 6 months from 2001 to 2007. the sections were located at variable distance, placing them in areas where active erosion was evident. in total, 13 field measurements were carried out, and the geometric characteristics of 28 cross-sections were obtained. morphometric analyses were carried out in both the main gully and a tributary reach by applying an empirical relationship between channel length and eroded volume. morphometric variables of the gully sections were combined into two dimensionless groups, and a morphological similarity between different linear erosion land forms (rills, ephemeral and permanent gullies) was obtained. then, the coefficient of variation of the calculated volumes was used to compare the instability between the main gully and the tributary reach. finally, the hydraulic geometry of the gully was assessed by calibrating three empirical power equations, which relate bankfull discharge with mean flow velocity, cross-sectional depth and width. the hydraulic characterization of the main gully and the tributary reach was investigated for each field survey and a different behavior was detected. the hydraulic analysis also demonstrated that higher values of discharge provide better predictions of flow velocity; the size of the main and tributary gullies affects the discharge-width relationship; and that gully depth is the variable which can be predicted with the highest accuracy.

computer-aided_design	surface passivation is an essential step for atomistic simulations. there can be many possible surface passivation results for a given device model, such as semiconductor devices that consist of si, gaas, or other materials because the bonding directions of the surface atoms may not be unique. based on the structure analysis of the given model, a generation method with structure descriptor (sdg) is proposed for surface passivation. compared with other existing solutions, the sdg method not only provides trimmer results, but also reduces the torsion angle energy of the model, which is preferred in the simulation of atomistic models. the efficiency of this method was validated through test results from several applications.
manufacturing_engineering	project based learning techniques have given rise to other learning techniques as research works based learning (rwbl). this technique is especially interested in the teching-learning process of materials processing technologies related disciplines. this work reports on the results of the application of rwbl techniques in a subject of the cadiz university 's master in manufacturing engineering: engineering of non-conventional materials removing processes. proposed research works have been designed on the basis of a classic research paper structure: introduction, state of the art, experimental procedure, results, discussion and conclusions. these proposed works were focused on a comparative analysis of different machining processes, mainly, electro-discharge machining, abrasive waterjet machining and high speed machining. this experience can be considered highly successful because the 100% of the students reached the learning objectives of the subject.
machine_design	the integrated starter generator replaces the conventional starter and alternator with one electrical machine handling both functions. start/stop functionality, vehicle launch assistance, and higher speed transient power supplementing enhance the vehicle performance at the lower fuel consumption rate. this functionality requires the electrical machine to provide high starting and launch assistant torque in motoring mode and relatively high power capability over the wide speed range for battery charging. the overall cost of the system is the underlining concern and crucial part of the design optimization. this paper focuses on advantages of induction machines (ims) in automotive industry and an approach to design a cost-effective electrical machine for belted starter-alternator applications. design optimization of the im is described to achieve desired performance, including rotor bar count, solid conductor (bar winding) versus stranded winding design, rotor bar shape optimization, and finally performance maps for the electrical machine, including both predicted and measured results. a thermal study of the machine is also presented, as well as the noise, vibration, and harshness (nvh) consideration in the design selection.
thermodynamics	for many years, the traditional process of gardenia yellow pigment extraction has produced wastewater containing significant quantities of geniposidic acid (gsa), a substance that could be put to pharmacological uses if it could be effectively recovered. this study aimed to provide an efficient adsorption material, d08, for recycling gsa. batch experiments showed that adsorption capacity depends on initial concentration and temperature. the maximal adsorption capacity of gsa onto an anionic exchanger reached 310 mg/g. the pk(a) value of gsa was determined to be 4.21. pore diffusion coefficients (d-p) of gsa for 283, 298 and 313 k were 3.274 x 10(-10), 5.069 x 10(-10) and 7.356 x 10(-10) m(2)/s, respectively. recovery efficiency of gsa was achieved to 99.81 %. in comparison with pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order equations, the pdm model demonstrated the best fit to the kinetics data of gsa adsorption. adsorption/desorption experiments proved that d08 offers great adsorption capacity, high adsorption rate and good repeatability. in order to help us to accurately comprehend the mass transfer process, numerical simulation and post-processing to variables c(r, t) and q(r, t) were performed to clarify the adsorption process.
materials_engineering	the mapping of the human genome is an important basis for the development of new medicals and medical treatments. consequently, it has attracted tremendous research funding over the last decade. on june 2011, the materials genome initiative was announced by the us president obama as collaboration on modeling and advanced materials databases. unfortunately, the materials genome was given a rather vague definition in the announcement. however, the materials genome should be defined in analogy with biological genomes and one may then conclude that: at any moment, the performance of a specific material depends on its chemical composition ( inherent property stored in its genome) and its environment ( external interactions-processing-conditions during usage). the materials genome should thus be defined as a set of information encoded in the language of thermodynamics obtained by careful assessment of experimental data and quantum mechanical calculations from which certain conclusions about the material can be drawn. the calphad databases contain the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of a materials system. such databases allow the prediction of materials structure as well as its response to processing and usage conditions, and are major parts of integrated computational materials engineering.
strength_of_materials	currently, within the framework of graduate education the student has to make a strong self-learning work. in the technical field this task is complicated by the difficulty of the contents covered. so to make better use of sessions is necessary that the student reaches previous knowledge independently of addressing the truly relevant contents and difficulties at these meetings. the work consists in the design of a didactic unit combining e-learning activities with sessions in order to improve academic productivity in the new context of higher education. the unit is designed in the engineering field, specifically in the subject of strength of materials of a mechanical engineering degree. by combining telelearning activities the student will acquire the basic skills needed to carry out a practical activity, consisting in the analysis, using the technique of photoelasticity. students must attain the knowledge and skills necessary for the practice in the laboratory and then fulfill the evaluation of the results, responding to questions asked by the teacher.]
internal_combustion_engine	internal combustion engines were the technology of choice for propulsion and decentral power supply in the last century. due to the high energy density of hydrocarbon based fuels that could so far not be reached by alternative technologies they will keep their leading role in most applications for the next decades. although, its general functionality seems to be unchanged since its invention, the internal combustion engine has gone through substantial developments driven by various challenges. within these, the pollution control has to be named first due to its role as the main driver for engine and aftertreatment development since the discussions on air quality which started 70 years ago. meanwhile, all industrialized countries and most of the emerging countries have more or less stringent regulations for the main harmful exhaust components (hc, co, nox, particulates). the second main challenge to be named is the reduction of co2 emissions. various engine technologies that are currently used to tackle these global trends lead to major impact on the exhaust aftertreatment components. to tackle these challenges the exhaust aftertreatment development has to be understood as integrated, multi-disciplinary and multi-scale design process considering engine design and operation, on board diagnosis and aftertreatment design and operation likewise.
