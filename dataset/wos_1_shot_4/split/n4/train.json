    "text": "there is growing interest in the description of short-lived patterns in the spatiotemporal cortical activity monitored via neuroimaging. most traditional analysis methods, designed to estimate relatively long-term brain dynamics, are not always appropriate to capture these patterns. here we introduce a novel data-driven approach for detecting short-lived fmri brain activity patterns. exploiting density peak clustering (rodriguez and laio [2014]), our approach reveals well localized clusters by identifying and grouping together voxels whose time-series are similar, irrespective of their brain location, even when very short time windows (similar to 10 volumes) are used. the method, which we call coherence density peak clustering (cdpc), is first tested on simulated data and compared with a standard unsupervised approach for fmri analysis, independent component analysis (ica). cdpc identifies activated voxels with essentially no false-positives and proves more reliable than ica, which is troubled by a number of false positives comparable to that of true positives. the reliability of the method is demonstrated on real fmri data from a simple motor task, containing brief iterations of the same movement. the clusters identified are found in regions expected to be involved in the task, and repeat synchronously with the paradigm. the methodology proposed is especially suitable for the study of short-time brain dynamics and single trial experiments, where the event or task of interest cannot be repeated for the same subject, as happens, for instance, in problem-solving, learning and decision-making. a gui implementation of our method is available for download at https://github.com/micheleallegra/cdpc.

    "text": "we used additive manufacturing (3d printing) to create ordered porous beds from a range of geometric shapes, including truncated icosahedra (approximating spheres), tetrahedral, octahedral, triangular bipyramid, and stellar octangular particles. we show that the printed porous media were highly reproducible and had excellent fidelity in physically reproducing computer-aided design models, with differences between designed and experimentally measured particle locations within +/- 0.5%, and within 13% in terms of bed porosity. experimental residence time distributions were measured and the reduced plate height, h, was determined under different reduced velocities (peclet number, pe = 4-400). the results (using equivalent particle diameter to non-dimensionalize) show that, for the simple cubic (sc) arrangement, tetrahedral particles had a lower plate height (h(min) = 1.56) than all other particle shapes tested, including spherical particles. we also, for the first time, experimentally validated computational predictions of the performance of sc, body centered cubic (bcc) and face centered cubic (fcc) arrangements of spheres, confirming that fcc is indeed superior (h(min), = 1.12) to sc (h(min) = 1.62). we conclude that the capability offered by additive manufacturing in controlling not only packing configuration but also shape, position and orientation of the geometric elements within the porous bed may, in the future, play a fundamental role in the design of highly efficient 3d-printed columns.

    "text": "this paper presents a neural network-based vision inspection system interfaced with a robot to detect and report ic lead defects on-line. the vision system consists of custom software that contains a neural network database for each of the ics to be inspected on a pcb. the vision system uses gray scale images and a single layer neural network with three outputs based on defect criteria. each ic has a different inspection area, thus, the input vector varies for each of the ics. the ic networks were trained with matlab 's bayesian regularization module. performance of each of the networks investigated was found to be 100%, based on the defect criteria. this system has been implemented and tested on several electronic products using proe, c++ and opengl software platforms [r. balderas, s. bose, automated robotic inspection system for electronic manufacturing, mse thesis, manufacturing engineering department, ut-pan american, 2002; a.i. edinbarough. j. amieva, experimental study on the robotics vision inspection of electronic components, bs thesis, engineering technology department, ut-brownsville, 2002].

    "text": "the complexity of products is increasing as more and more functions and structures are included in them, leading to higher requirements on better understand of users' behaviour in term of using the product during the early engineering design phase. although, industry and academia agree that human aspects are important for the success of the product, there are few methods that support the designers concerning these factors during the synthesis of the design process. the article describes a behaviour design approach (bda) to be used by industrial engineers, designers and ergonomists for ergonomic analysis and evaluation in product or machine design. this approach has been developed for both expert and non-expert practitioners, who can integrate user behaviour and product behaviour during the design phase for improving product performance.\n",

    "text": "we compare the extent to which the properties of simple liquids are pertinent to short to moderate chain n-alkanes ranging from ethane (c-2) to dodecane (c-12). explicit geometric features such as bonds, angles and dihedral potentials in currently available models of n-alkanes make these systems more realistic, and distinct from the generalized lennard-jones chain fluids. our study confirms that the presence of these flexible geometric constraints completely suppresses the energy-virial correlation in these systems. however, they are found to have a strong energy-virial correlation in high density region of their phase diagram when the contribution from these geometric constraints are excluded. for fluids having simple liquid like behavior, semi-quantitative relationships between structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics are well established. range of state points is explored to test the applicability of such relationships for n-alkanes. considering the collection of monomer beads as the reference state, thermodynamic and structural entropic measures are systematically compared with and without intramolecular contributions. we show that the pair entropy computed with explicit intramolecular geometric constraints correlates well with thermodynamic excess entropy. both the thermodynamic and pair entropy have strong isochore dependence with reduced diffusivity. intermolecular pair entropy correlates well with reduced diffusivity. the role of multiparticle correlations is highlighted for predicting thermodynamic and transport properties in these chain systems. triplet correlations in addition to pair correlations are used as an attempt to improve the structural contribution to excess entropy. we show that if the three particle contribution is included in the computation of structural entropy, the resulting value overestimates the excess entropy.

    "text": "the paper refers to the approach used in science, specifically in building materials engineering, assuming the possibility of material modeling, including modeling of the technical characteristics of building materials of various compositions as well as modeling phenomena/processes that occur during the use of materials and structures made from them. the authors analyze the merits of the approach of modeling in the context of compliance computational models to reality, consider the significance of the selection of the proper model (type of mathematical function, number of input data) which should be based on the knowledge of modeled material or phenomenon and later adequate verification of the model. the authors also underline importance of proper interpretation of results obtained by calculation. misrepresentation may result in a misstated model of the studied phenomenon and lead to incorrect conclusions, which puts the researcher far from the truth, that he or she should always seek for.\n",

    "text": "in this paper, the method of discrete element model (dem) simulation was used to investigate the mechanical properties of sic ceramic materials under the action of pre-stress. using the bonded particle model (bpm), several different numerical tests (such as uct, tpb, senb tests) of sic ceramic were established. different pre-stress values were applied on the lateral surface of the ceramic specimen during the numerical simulation process, all tests were carried out at least 5 times with different random number, and the average mechanical properties results were calculated. it was showed that the existence of pre-stress has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of materials. it can enhance the strength of materials, while the force action on material in machining process force or action force the crack 's initiation and propagation was limited.\n",
