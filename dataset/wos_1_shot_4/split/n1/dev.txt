symbolic_computation	under investigation in this paper is a (3 + 1)-dimensional variable-coefficient kadomtsev-petviashvili equation, which describes the propagation of surface and internal water waves. by virtue of the binary bell polynomials, symbolic computation and auxiliary independent variable, the bilinear forms, soliton solutions, backlund transformations and lax pair are obtained. variable coefficients of the equation can affect the solitonic structure, when they are specially chosen, while curved and linear solitons are illustrated. elastic collisions between/among two and three solitons are discussed, through which the solitons keep their original shapes invariant except for some phase shifts.
computer_vision	dual assignment clustering (dac) has been recently proposed in computer vision, shown to yield improved accuracy for action clustering tasks. the key idea of dac is to consider another view (different from the original features) for the same set of samples, and to exploit the statistical correlation between cluster assignments in two views. however, the existing optimization is heuristic, mainly due to the difficulty in combinatorial optimization for hard cluster assignment. in this paper, we introduce a novel dac optimization algorithm based on a probabilistic (soft) treatment, where the proposed objective function incorporates both the goodness of clustering in each view and the correlation between two views in a more principled and theoretically sound fashion. we also propose a lower-bound maximization technique that not only admits fast per-iteration solutions but also guarantees convergence to a local optimum. the superiority of the proposed approach to the existing methods is demonstrated for several activity video datasets.

computer_graphics	orientation and wayfinding in architectural immersive virtual environments (ives) are non-trivial, accompanying tasks which generally support the users' main task. world in miniatures (wims)-essentially 3d maps containing a scene replica-are an established approach to gain survey knowledge about the virtual world, as well as information about the user 's relation to it. however, for large-scale, information-rich scenes, scaling and occlusion issues result in diminishing returns. since there typically is a lack of standardized information regarding scene decompositions, presenting the inside of self-contained scene extracts is challenging. therefore, we present an automatic wim generation workflow for arbitrary, realistic in-and outdoor ives in order to support users with meaningfully selected and scaled extracts of the ive as well as corresponding context information. additionally, a 3d user interface is provided to manually manipulate the represented extract.
operating_systems	we describe the main features of the developed software tool, namely plate-motion 2.0 (pem2), which allows inferring the euler pole parameters by inverting the observed velocities at a set of sites located on a rigid block (inverse problem). pem2 allows also calculating the expected velocity value for any point located on the earth providing an euler pole (direct problem). pem2 is the updated version of a previous software tool initially developed for easy-to-use file exchange with the gamit/globk software package. the software tool is developed in matlab(a (r)) framework and, as the previous version, includes a set of matlab functions (m-files), guis (fig-files), map data files (mat-files) and user 's manual as well as some example input files. new changes in pem2 include (1) some bugs fixed, (2) improvements in the code, (3) improvements in statistical analysis, (4) new input/output file formats. in addition, pem2 can be now run under the majority of operating systems. the tool is open source and freely available for the scientific community.
machine_learning	cutting plane algorithm (cpa) is a generalization of iterative first-order gradient method, in which the objective function is approximated successively by supporting hyperplanes. cpa has been tailored to solve regularized loss minimization in machine learning by exploiting the regularization structure. in particular, for linear support vector machine (svm) embedding a line search procedure effectively remedies the fluctuations of function value and speeds up the convergence in practical issue. however, the existing line search strategy based on sorting algorithm takes o(mlogm) time. in this paper, we propose a more effective line search solver which spends only linear time. it can be extended to multiclass svm in which an optimized explicit piecewise linear function finding algorithm is prearranged. the total svm training time is proved to reduce theoretically and experiments consistently confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

data_structures	reaction mechanism generator (rmg) constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction steps using a general understanding of how molecules react. species thermochemistry is estimated through benson group additivity and reaction rate coefficients are estimated using a database of known rate rules and reaction templates. at its core, rmg relies on two fundamental data structures: graphs and trees. graphs are used to represent chemical structures, and trees are used to represent thermodynamic and kinetic data. models are generated using a rate-based algorithm which excludes species from the model based on reaction fluxes. rmg can generate reaction mechanisms for species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. it also has capabilities for estimating transport and solvation properties, and it automatically computes pressure-dependent rate coefficients and identifies chemically-activated reaction paths. rmg is an object-oriented program written in python, which provides a stable, robust programming architecture for developing an extensible and modular code base with a large suite of unit tests. computationally intensive functions are cythonized for speed improvements. program summary program title: rmg catalogue identifier: aezw_v1_0 program summary url: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/aezw_v1_0.html program obtainable from: cpc program library, queen 's university, belfast, n. ireland licensing provisions: mit/x11 license no. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 958681 no. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 9495441 distribution format: tar.gz programming language: python. computer: windows, ubuntu, and mac os computers with relevant compilers. operating system: unix/linux/windows. ram: 1 gb minimum, 16 gb or more for larger simulations classification: 16.12. external routines: rdkit, open babel, dassl, daspk, dqed, numpy, scipy nature of problem: automatic generation of chemical kinetic mechanisms for molecules containing c, h, 0, s, and n. solution method: rate-based algorithm adds most important species and reactions to a model, with rate constants derived from rate rules and other parameters estimated via group additivity methods. additional comments: the rmg software package also includes cantherm, a tool for computing the thermodynamic properties of chemical species and both high-pressure-limit and pressure-dependent rate coefficients for chemical reactions using results from quantum chemical calculations. cantherm is compatible with a variety of ab initio quantum chemistry software programs, including but not limited to gaussian, mopac, qchem, and molpro. running time: from 30 s for the simplest molecules, to up to several weeks, depending on the size of the molecule and the conditions of the reaction system chosen.

network_security	as computer networks are emerging in everyday life, network security has become an important issue. simultaneously, attacks are becoming more sophisticated, making the defense of computer networks increasingly difficult. attack graph is a modelling tool used in the assessment of security of enterprise networks. since its introduction a considerable amount of research effort has been spent in the development of theory and practices around the idea of attack graph. this paper presents a consolidated view of major attack graph generation and analysis techniques.
image_processing	a modified gaussian current density is put forward, which is used to simulate the dynamic process of az31b magnesium alloy double-electrode gas metal arc welding (de-gmaw) droplet transfer. the process of droplet transfer in the az31b magnesium alloy de-gmaw was simulated using fluent software. the influence of different bypass welding currents was investigated with a constant total current. the simulated results revealed that when the bypass current was 0 a, the process was the globular transfer type, the droplet transfer with a bypass current of 80 a was a projected transfer type and the droplet transfer at a bypass current of 170 a was a spray transfer type. the critical current is decreased so that spray transfer would occur at a lower current level in the de-gmaw process. as the bypass current was increased, the shape of droplet changed from oval to round and the transition frequency of the droplet increased in a stepwise fashion. to confirm the accuracy of the simulated results, welding experiments were performed and the image processing method was used to obtain the droplet size. the simulated and experimental results were found to be in good agreement.
parallel_computing	recently the hardware performance of mobile devices have been extremely increased and advanced mobile devices provide multi-cores and high clock speed. in addition, mobile devices have advantages in mobility and portability compared with pc and console, so many games and simulation programs have been developed under mobile environments. physically-based simulation is a one of the key issues for deformable object modeling which is widely used to represent the realistic expression of 3d soft objects with tetrahedrons for game and 3d simulation. however, it requires high computation power to plausibly and realistically represent the physical behaviors and interactions of deformable objects. in this paper, we implemented parallel cloth and mass-spring simulation using graphics processing unit (gpu) with opencl and multi-threaded central processing unit ( cpu) on a mobile device. we applied cpu and gpu parallel computing technique into spring force computation and integration methods such as euler, midpoint, 4th-order runge-kutta to optimize the computational burden of dynamic simulation. the integration methods compute the next step of positions and velocities in each node. in this paper, we tested the performance analysis for the spring force calculation and integration method process using cpu only, multi-threaded cpu, and gpu on mobile device respectively. our experimental results concluded that the calculation using proposed multi-threaded cpu and gpu multi-threaded cpu are much faster than using just the cpu only.
distributed_computing	cloud computing is one of the increasing technology that is connected with grid computing, utility computing, distributed computing. in today 's world, securing of data plays a vital role. in the computing environment, data privacy and data security is popular in fields like government, industry, and business for the future development. these are inter-related to both hardware and software. hence, this paper analyses the data security solutions in cloud computing.
algorithm_design	hadoop is one of the most important big data processing and storage systems. in recent years, a lot of efforts have been put to enhance hadoop 's performance from networking perspectives. however, there are limited tools that can help researchers to verify their networking algorithm design in terms of hadoop 's performance. this paper proposes doopnet which is a framework and toolset for creating hadoop clusters in a virtualized environment and for monitoring/analysing of hadoop 's networking characteristics under different network configurations. doopnet enables users to automatically set up a hadoop cluster over docker containers running inside mininet. the hadoop traffic is collected inside the containers and virtual switches through network flow monitors. the users can easily modify network topologies or configurations through mininet, observe the networking behaviour through network flow monitors, and analyse the effects of different network settings on hadoop 's performance. examples are presented to demonstrate how to setup the doopnet testbed and analyse hadoop traffic.
computer_programming	natural language processing (nlp) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. the idea of using a natural language for computer programming is to make it easier for people to talk to computers in their native tongue and spare them the pain of learning a computer friendly language like assembly, c, c++, java, lisp etc. among all the natural languages, sanskrit in its style is identified to be the best language which has minimum deviation. panini, the creator of sanskrit formulated 3,949 rules. this research paper explores varied distinctive features of al like nlp, semantic net, vibhakti, dual case, inflection based syntax etc. and how sanskrit effectively triumphs over these limitations and fulfills the prerequisites of a natural language processor.
relational_databases	intuitionistic fuzzy databases are used to handle imprecise and uncertain data as they represent the membership, nonmembership, and hesitancy associated with a certain element in a set. this paper presents the intuitionistic fuzzy fourth normal form to decompose the multivalued dependent data. a technique to determine intuitionistic fuzzy multivalued dependencies by working on the closure of dependencies has been proposed. we derive the closure by obtaining all the logically implied dependencies by a set of intuitionistic fuzzy multivalued dependencies, i.e., inference rules. a complete set of inference rules for the intuitionistic fuzzy multivalued dependencies has been given along with the derivation of each rule. these rules help us to compute the dependency closure and we further use the same for defining the intuitionistic fuzzy fourth normal form.
software_engineering	eliciting sufficient high-quality knowledge from individuals to build a robust and useful artificial intelligence or intelligent system solution is a very time-consuming and expensive activity, especially in domains where the knowledge is informal, partial, incomplete, implicit, tacit and unstructured. moreover, in order to develop a solution, a systematic way to incorporate the elicited knowledge into a specification is necessary. the goal of this thesis is to develop a strategy oriented to the transfer and transformation of knowledge with the aim of eliciting and structuring the most quantity of domain knowledge, either tacit or explicit; then incorporate it into a specification that covers the needs and expectations of domain specialists. the application of the strategy in real informally structured domain cases provides empirical insights about its usefulness and value.
bioinformatics	type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is characterized by islet beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance, which leads to an inability to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. circulating micrornas (mirnas) have been suggested as novel biomarkers for t2dm prediction or disease progression. however, mirnas and their roles in the pathogenesis of t2dm remain to be fully elucidated. in the present study, the serum mirna expression profiles of t2dm patients in chinese cohorts were examined. total rna was extracted from serum samples of 10 patients with t2dm and five healthy controls, and these was used in reverse-transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis with the exiqon pcr system of 384 serum/plasma mirnas. a total of seven mirnas were differentially expressed between the two groups (fold change >3 or < 0.33; p < 0.05). the serum expression levels of mir-455-5p, mir-454-3p, mir-144-3p and mir-96-5p were higher in patients with t2dm, compared with those of healthy subjects, however, the levels of mir-409-3p, mir-665 and mir-766-3p were lower. hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that it was possible to separate patients with t2dm and control individuals into their own similar categories by these differential mirnas. target prediction showed that 97 t2dm candidate genes were potentially modulated by these seven mirnas. kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis revealed that 24 pathways were enriched for these genes, and the majority of these pathways were enriched for the targets of induced and repressed mirnas, among which insulin, adipocytokine and t2dm pathways, and several cancer-associated pathways have been previously associated with t2dm. in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that serum mirnas may be novel biomarkers for t2dm and provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of t2dm.
cryptography	we propose an ultra-lightweight, compact, and low power block cipher boron. boron is a substitution and permutation based network, which operates on a 64-bit plain text and supports a key length of 128/80 bits. boron has a compact structure which requires 1939 gate equivalents (ges) for a 128-bit key and 1626 ges for an 80-bit key. the boron cipher includes shift operators, round permutation layers, and xor operations. its unique design helps generate a large number of active s-boxes in fewer rounds, which thwarts the linear and differential attacks on the cipher. boron shows good performance on both hardware and software platforms. boron consumes less power as compared to the lightweight cipher led and it has a higher throughput as compared to other existing sp network ciphers. we also present the security analysis of boron and its performance as an ultra-lightweight compact cipher. boron is a well-suited cipher design for applications where both a small footprint area and low power dissipation play a crucial role.
structured_storage	electronic storage of patient-related data will replace paper-based patient records in the near future. some steps in medical practice can even now not be achieved without electronic data processing. both systems, conventional paper-based and electronic-based records, have advantages and disadvantages which have to be taken into consideration. the advantages of electronic-based records are e.g. good availability of data, structured storage of data, scientific analysis of long-term data and possible data exchange with colleagues in the context of teleconsultation systems. problems have to be solved in the field of data security, initial high investment costs and time consumption in learning to use the system as well as in incompatibility of existing it systems.
electric_motor	nowadays, increasingly stringent directives in the transport sector open interesting possibilities for the development of new traction technologies based on electrochemical storage and fuel cells, that are characterized by some limitations: the electrochemical storage systems have a limited range while fuel cells have not a proper response capability for very variable load demands. with the aim to realize a hybrid electric vehicle (hev) able to increase range of autonomy, cnr itae has designed a minibus (class b-category m3) having an electric motor of 40 kw powered by a polymeric fuel cell system of 20 kw and a lithium battery system of 70 kwh. the study is focused on evaluation of the hybrid propulsion system performance in different operating conditions. in particular, powertrain configuration and energy management strategies have been studied to optimize the efficiency of the hev, overcoming the limitations of these technologies, reducing energy losses and increasing range of the vehicle. tests on the road have been conducted and energy production and consumption of the vehicle have been logged.

digital_control	in boost converters and other indirect energy transfer topologies, the fastest transient response usually does not coincide with the minimum possible output voltage deviation. this paper introduces a practical mixed-signal current programmed mode (cpm) controller that, compared to time-optimal solutions, provides a smaller deviation, lower current stress, and simpler controller implementation. to recover from transients, the controller passes through two phases. in the first phase, the inductor current is set in the proximity of its steady-state value, so that the initial transient-caused capacitor charging/discharging process is reversed. in the second phase, the voltage is gradually recovered. the controller implements a simple algorithm for setting up the inductor current and the output voltage peak/valley values during transients, based on the output current estimate, which is obtained through a self-tuning procedure. the operation of the controller is verified both through simulations and experimentally, with a boost-based 12 to 48 v, 100-w prototype, operating at 100-khz switching frequency. a comparison with a time-optimal controller shows that the introduced programmable-deviation system results in up to 1.9 times smaller voltage deviation while limiting component stress.
microcontroller	we present a high-voltage cmos neural-interface chip for a multichannel vestibular prosthesis (mvp) that measures head motion and modulates vestibular nerve activity to restore vision- and posture-stabilizing reflexes. this application specific integrated circuit neural interface (asic-ni) chip was designed to work with a commercially available microcontroller, which controls the asic-ni via a fast parallel interface to deliver biphasic stimulation pulses with 9-bit programmable current amplitude via 16 stimulation channels. the chip was fabricated in the onsemi c5 0.5 micron, high-voltage cmos process and can accommodate compliance voltages up to 12 v, stimulating vestibular nerve branches using biphasic current pulses up to 1.45 +/- 0.06 ma with durations as short as 10 mu s/phase. the asic-ni includes a dedicated digital-to-analog converter for each channel, enabling it to perform complex multipolar stimulation. the asic-ni replaces discrete components that cover nearly half of the 2nd generation mvp (mvp2) printed circuit board, reducing the mvp system size by 48% and power consumption by 17%. physiological tests of the asic-based mvp system (mvp2a) in a rhesus monkey produced reflexive eye movement responses to prosthetic stimulation similar to those observed when using the mvp2. sinusoidal modulation of stimulus pulse rate from 68-130 pulses per second at frequencies from 0.1 to 5 hz elicited appropriately-directed slow phase eye velocities ranging in amplitude from 1.9-16.7 degrees/s for the mvp2 and 2.0-14.27s for the mvp2a. the eye velocities evoked by mvp2 and mvp2a showed no significant difference (t-test, p = 0.34), suggesting that the mvp2a achieves performance at least as good as the larger mvp2.
electrical_network	this paper deals with the transfer of data by power-line communication (plc) on a pulse width modulated (pwm) energy network. target applications concern the adjustable speed drive for industrial infrastructures. in order to implement an efficient communication solution, it is necessary to have a model of the communication channel to determine certain parameters like bandwidth, carrier frequency and modulation formats. the originality of our work is the methodology used to determine the channel model. the first results of simulation and experimental validation are presented in this paper.
electricity	this paper aims to propose a methodology for optimization of solar chimney power plants taking into account the techno-economic parameters. the indicator used for optimization is the comparison between the actual achieved simple payback period for the design and the minimum possible (optimum) simple payback period as a reference. an optimization model was executed for different twelve designs in the range 5-200 mw to cover reinforced concrete chimney, sloped collector, and floating chimney. the height of the chimney was optimized and the associated collector area was calculated accordingly. relationships between payback periods, electricity price, and the peak power capacity of each power plant were developed. the resulted payback periods for the floating chimney power plants were the shortest compared to the other studied designs. for a solar chimney power plant with 100 mw at electricity price 0.10 usd/kwh, the simple payback period for the reference case was 4.29 years for floating chimney design compared to 23.47 and 16.88 years for reinforced concrete chimney and sloped collector design, respectively. after design optimization for 100 mw power plant of each of reinforced concrete, sloped collector, and floating chimney, a save of 19.63, 2.22, and 2.24 million usd, respectively from the initial cost of the reference case is achieved. sensitivity analysis was conducted in this study to evaluate the impacts of varied running cost, solar radiation, and electricity price on the payback periods of solar chimney power plant. floating chimney design is still performing after applying the highest ratio of annual running cost to the annual revenue. the sensitivity analysis showed that at the same solar radiation and electricity price, the simple payback period for 200 mw with sloped collector design would almost have the double simple payback period for 5 mw with floating chimney design.

operational_amplifier	we propose an analog front-end integrated circuit (ic) design for a readout ic (roic), which applies a fixed-voltage-bias sensing method with a capacitance transimpedance amplifier (ctia) to an input stage in order to simplify the circuit structure of the roic and the ir sensor characteristic control. for a sample-and-hold stage, in order to display and control a signal detected by the ir sensor using a 2-d focal plane array, a differential delta sampling circuit is proposed, which effectively removes the fixed pattern noise. in addition, a two-stage variable-gain amplifier equipped with a rail-to-rail fully differential operational amplifier is applied to the roic to achieve high voltage sensitivity. the output characteristic of the proposed device is 30.84 mv/k and the linearity error rate is less than 0.07%. after checking the performance of the roic using an hspice simulation, the chip is manufactured and measured using the united microelectronics corporation japan 0.35-mu m standard cmos process to confirm that the simulation results from the actual design are in close agreement with the measurement results.
analog_signal_processing	a procedure based on the multiple expansion of the brain electrical generator is used here to derive analytical expressions for the transfer matrix necessary to obtain potentials referenced to infinity. its features include: avoidance of computations that involve a large number of discrete dipole sources; faster evaluation compared to the use of the dipole layer; and a transparency showing the parameters that constitute the transfer matrix. the paper also proposes the construction of the standardization matrix without the use of the general inverse of a non-symmetrical matrix.
state_space_representation	based on dynamical modeling, robust trajectory tracking control of a spherical mobile robot is proposed. the spherical robot is composed of a spherical shell and three independent rotors which act as the inner driver mechanism. owing to rolling without slipping assumption, the robot is subjected to two nonholonomic constraints. the state space representation of the system is developed using dynamical equations of the robot 's motion. as the main contribution, a dynamical model based smc (sliding mode controller) is designed for position control of the robot under parameters uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. to decrease the chattering phenomena originated by the sign function, the well-known boundary layer technique is imposed on the smc. the control gains are determined through using lyapanov 's direct method in such a way that the robustness and to zero convergence of the controller 's tracking error are guaranteed. wide range computer simulations are performed to show the significant tracking performance of the proposed smc in particular against parameters uncertainty and white gaussian noises. the simulation results show the significant performance of the designed nonlinear control system in trajectory tracking control of the spherical robot even in the presence of parameters uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics.
signal-flow_graph	this paper introduces a systematic methodology for applying mason 's signal flow graph to the analysis of feedback circuits. we demonstrate that the relationships among signals of feedback circuits can be represented in a intuitive and graphical manner utilizing signal flow graphs. once constructed, the desired solutions can be achieved by simple inspection of the signal flow graph. the thevenin and norton equivalent circuits are utilized to model the loading effects of the feedback network in the example circuits presented.
electrical_circuits	knowledge representation plays a very important role for designing knowledge base systems as well as intelligent systems. nowadays, there are many effective methods for representing such as: semantic network, rule-base systems, computational network. computational objects knowledge base (cokb) can be used to represent the total knowledge and design the knowledge base of systems. in fact, a popular form of knowledge domain is knowledge about operations and computational relations, especially computational knowledge domain, such as: linear algebra, analytic geometry. however, cokb model and the other models have not solved yet some problems about operators: specification of operator, properties of operator, reducing an expression. in this paper, we will present a reducing model of cokb. this model, called ops-model, represents knowledge about operators between objects and solve some problems related to these operators. through that, the algorithms for designing inference engine of model have been built up. moreover, ops-model has been applied to specify a part of knowledge domain about direct current (dc) electrical circuits and construct a program for solving some problems on this knowledge domain.
lorentz_force_law	the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations of electromagnetism are reviewed and the maxwell equations are obtained from the hamiltonian for a system of many electric charges. it is shown that three of the equations which were obtained from the hamiltonian, namely the lorentz force law and two maxwell equations, can be obtained as well from a set of postulated poisson brackets. it is shown how the results derived from these brackets can be used to reconstruct the original lagrangian for the theory aided by some reasoning based on physical concepts.
system_identification	an optimal controller for high-precision spiral positioning of a piezoelectric tube scanner used in an atomic force microscope (afm) is proposed in this paper. in the proposed control scheme, a second-order vibration compensator is incorporated with the piezoelectric tube scanner (pts) to suppress the vibration of the pts at the resonant frequency. an internal model of a reference sinusoidal signal is included with the augmented plant model and an integrator is introduced with a linear quadratic gaussian controller which reduces the phase error between the input and output sinusoids. the proposed method allows a commercial afm to scan at high scanning speeds as an alternative to the raster scanning approach. the performance of this controller is assessed with closed-loop frequency response, tracking accuracy, and a set of spiral scanned images. the raster scanned images obtained using the standard afm pi controller is also presented for comparison with the spiral images. experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. note to practitioner-the main motivation for this work is to propose a control system for high-speed imaging using an afm. the scanning speed of a commercial afm is limited by the positioning accuracy of the scanner. the scanner is made of a piezoelectric tube actuator. the commercially available scanners have the following problems: 1) creep effect at slow speed scanning; 2) hysteresis effect during large range scanning (these two effects result in inaccurate reference motion tracking); and 3) vibration effect at high frequencies due to its mechanical flexibility. to overcome these limitations, an internal reference model-based linear quadratic gaussian control approach is designed and experimentally implemented using the dspace ds-1103 real-time prototype system. before the control design, the scanner is modelled (experimentally) by using a system identification method, and a vibration compensator is incorporated with the identified model. apart from the control design, a spiral motion of the scanner is considered instead of a well-known raster scanning which is adopted in all commercial afms. the designed controller is applied in the piezoelectric tube scanner experimentally, and the obtained results are presented in terms of tracking accuracy, damping of scanners vibration, and generating high-quality images as compared with the existing commercially available methods. the existing commercial system can generate a sensible image up to 30 hz scanning frequency but, using the proposed method, a high-quality image up to 120 hz is achieved. with a slight software modification, the proposed improvement can be used in commercial afms.
pid_controller	this paper deals with the design of a controller possessing tracking capability of any realisable reference trajectory while rejecting measurement noise. we consider discrete-time-varying multi-input multi-output stable linear systems and a proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller. a novel recursive algorithm estimating the time-varying pid gains is proposed. the development of the proposed algorithm is based on minimising a stochastic performance index. the implementation of the proposed algorithm is described and boundedness of trajectories and convergence characteristics are presented for a discretised continuous-time model. simulation results are included to illustrate the performance capabilities of the proposed algorithm.
voltage_law	given a nonlinear infinite resistive network, an operating point can be determined by approximating the network by finite networks obtained by shorting together various infinite sets of nodes, and then taking a limit of the nodal potential functions of the finite networks. initially, by taking a completion of the node set of the infinite network under a metric given by the resistances, limit points are obtained that represent generalized ends, which we call ""terminals,"" of the infinite network. these terminals can be shorted together to obtain a generalized kind of node, a special case of a 1-node. an operating point will involve kirchhoff 's current law holding at 1-nodes, and so the ow of current into these terminals is studied. we give existence and bounds for an operating point that also has a nodal potential function, which is continuous at the 1-nodes. the existence is derived from the said approximations.
control_engineering	we consider the problem of estimating an arbitrary dynamical parameter of an open quantum system in the input-output formalism. for irreducible markov processes, we show that in the limit of large times the system-output state can be approximated by a quantum gaussian state whose mean is proportional to the unknown parameter. this approximation holds locally in a neighbourhood of size t(-1/2) in the parameter space, and provides an explicit expression of the asymptotic quantum fisher information in terms of the markov generator. furthermore we show that additive statistics of the counting and homodyne measurements also satisfy local asymptotic normality and we compute the corresponding classical fisher informations. the general theory is illustrated with the examples of a two-level system and the atom maser. our results contribute towards a better understanding of the statistical and probabilistic properties of the output process, with relevance for quantum control engineering, and the theory of non-equilibrium quantum open systems.
