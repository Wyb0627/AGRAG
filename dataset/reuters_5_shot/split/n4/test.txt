label 24	SOUTH KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS NARROWS IN FEBRUARY South Korea's customs-cleared trade surplus narrowed to 110 mln dlrs in February from 525 mln in January, provisional trade ministry figures show. In February 1986 there was a deficit of 264 mln dlrs. February exports rose to 2.87 billion dlrs, fob, from 2.83 billion in January and 2.30 billion in February 1986. CIF imports were 2.76 billion against 2.31 billion in January and 2.57 billion in February last year.

label 24	CANADA CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT UP IN QUARTER Canada's current account deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third, Statistics Canada said. The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrs from 1985's 584 mln dlr deficit, the federal agency said. The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to 2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter, was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04 billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs. The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1985. In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter quarter. The total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in 1986 from 7.68 billion dlr in 1985.  
label 24	DUTCH CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS FALLS IN 1986 The Dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987. The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased. While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices. The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls. The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.  
label 24	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters. Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct. China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said. Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct. Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion. A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market. The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said. A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct. The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares. "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," he said. The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s. "Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China," he said. "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls," he said. The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16. A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs. "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said. The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development." Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985. A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago. The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago. The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases. "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," he added. Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs. A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct. "We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account," he said. He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.  
label 24	PORTUGUESE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN 1986 Portugal's trade deficit narrowed in 1986 to 336.5 billion escudos from 354.8 billion in 1985, according to provisional National Statistics Institute figures. Imports totalled 1,412.6 billion escudos and exports 1,076.1 billion compared with 1,326.5 billion and 971.7 billion in 1985. Expressed in terms of dollars, imports rose 21.2 pct and exports 26.1 pct and the trade deficit increased by 7.8 pct. In its first year as a member of the European Community, Portugal recorded a deficit of 98.1 billion escudos in its trade with the other Community states compared with a deficit of 2.4 billion escudos in 1985. Imports from the EC in 1986 totalled 830.2 billion escudos, while exports to the Community were 732.1 billion, compared with 609.5 billion and 607.1 billion the previous year. Portugal's deficit with Spain was 83.2 billion escudos against 57.7 billion in 1985, with Italy it was 70.4 billion against 30.3 billion, and with West Germany 40.5 billion against 19.1 billion.  
label 24	FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA JUMPS IN LAST QTR The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said. The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment. The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said. Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said. It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs, associated with the previously reported restructuring of the Australian operations of General Motors Corp &lt;GM>. GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain Australian liabilities of its local unit &lt;General Motors-Holden's Ltd>, it said. However, net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said. Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier. Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier.

label 24	DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING NOT DRAMATIC - MINISTER Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised. Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983. "This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating," Simonsen said in a statement. "The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability," he added. "Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect. "If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past," Simonsen said. Standard and Poor's said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt. The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics. Government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year. Denmark's net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said.  
label 25	SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption. Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year. In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong. The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness. In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  
label 25	OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages. The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as Norway, Sweden and Finland. Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report said. After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark and Norway. Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.

label 25	FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s. "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible," Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons. Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget. And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said. Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues. But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system. The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991. Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  
label 25	U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say. Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent. "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, " Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says. "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call," Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession," Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve. "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable," he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. "It is very difficult to be optimistic," Gut said.

That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is down from 1985's four pct increase. The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in 1987. Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in the third quarter. Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8 pct in the two previous quarters.

Output of goods producing industries rose 1.6 pct in the month, with virtually all the growth occurring in manufacturing and mining. Services producing industries expanded 1.0 pct.  
label 25	CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said. "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd. Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it's not a very promising number." "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she added. The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year. Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the federal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985. But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

label 26	BETHLEHEM STEEL &lt;BS> SETS STEEL PRICE INCREASES Bethlehem Steel Corp said prices for steel sheet products will be increased up to 30 dlrs a ton effective January 3. The increases will affect certain non-contract or spot transactions and will be achieved through reductions in competitive discounts. The company said transaction prices for contract accounts, which have a duration of six months or more, will also be increased to commensurate levels. Percentage increases were not immediately available. Prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles, appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350 and 800 dlrs a ton. The company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet transaction prices to more equitable levels. In many cases, prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said. Bethlehem also said that in response to changing market conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price contracts.  
label 26	EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis." But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes.  
label 26	NIGERIA, GUINEA SET UP IRON ORE FIRM WITH LIBERIA Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said. The communique was issued after two days of talks here between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa. Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria 16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved, but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in world iron ore markets. Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be decided after a project feasibility study. This would be completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World Bank, which is also expected to give financial support. Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year, will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early 1990. On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and silver.  
label 26	INDIA AND JAPAN TO DISCUSS IRON ORE PRICES The state-owned Minerals and Metals Trading Corp will send a team to Japan next week to negotiate an iron ore export contract for 1987/88 beginning April 1, trade sources said. Japan, the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore with imports of around 23 mln tonnes a year, has asked India to reduce prices from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne, the sources said. "Japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from India next year if New Delhi fails to reduce the price," one source said, but declined to give further details.  
label 26	USSR TO CUT COAL PRICE FOR JAPANESE STEELMILLS The Soviet Union has agreed to cut its coking coal export prices to Japanese steel mills by about five dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting April 1 in exchange for an increase in export volume, industry sources said. The prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for Neryungrinsky coal and at 43.80 dlrs for Kuznetsky coal, fob. Japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both areas, up from 4.2 mln a year earlier, they said. The steelmakers had asked Moscow to agree to a cutback to 3.7 mln tonnes in 1987/88, but the Soviet Union urged Japan to increase the amount to 6.5 mln, they said.

label 26	EC COMMISSION HAS OPEN ATTITUDE ON STEEL QUOTAS The EC Commission said it was adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods. In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity by 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in 1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year. The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.  
label 26	YUGOSLAV 1990 STEEL OUTPUT TO HIT 6.3 MLN TONNES Yugoslavian steel output will rise by one mln tonnes to 6.3 mln tonnes a year between 1986 and 1990 under a development program adopted by the Yugoslav Iron and Steel Metallurgy Association, the official Tanjug news agency said. The association groups together the main Yugoslav iron and steel enterprises. Extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate of nine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program. Iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year, reaching 4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade. Tanjug said the programme would create conditions for raising exports of finished steel products. The main Yugoslav steel producers plan to market 5.35 mln tonnes of steel goods this year, or 150,000 tonnes more than last year, with 1.5 mln tonnes going to export.  
label 26	TAIWAN STEEL FIRM SEES LOWER EXPORTS, MORE OUTPUT State-owned &lt;China Steel Corp> said its steel exports will drop to some 600,000 tonnes in the year ending June 30, 1987 from more than 810,000 in 1985/86. Production by the company, Taiwan's largest steel maker, is expected to rise to 3.33 mln tonnes from 3.27 mln, a spokesman told Reuters. He attributed the export decline to the rise in the Taiwan dollar, which has eroded the competitiveness of the company's products against those from South Korea. The spokesman said the company is undergoing an expansion project which calls for a boost in production to 5.65 mln tonnes a year from the current level. The project, costing 52.3 billion Taiwan dlrs, will be completed by April 1988, two months ahead of the targetted date, he said. The spokesman said the company exports its products to Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, the U.S., The Middle East and Africa.  
label 27	FCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA Total supply of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said. Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.  
label 27	CACEX DENIES BRAZIL FCOJ PRICE RISE RUMOURS There has been no rise in the price of Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice, FCOJ, a spokesman for the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department, Cacex, said. He was responding to rumours in the international market that Brazil had raised its FCOJ prices in range of 1,075 to 1,150 dlrs per tonne.  
label 27	U.S. TO SET ORANGE JUICE DUTIES MONDAY The Commerce Department on Monday will set final dumping duties on frozen orange juice from Brazil, department officials said. A preliminary duty of 8.54 pct was set last Oct 17 on the imports, which run at about 700 mln dlrs a year. Commerce's ruling on Monday will reset the duties on the basis of more detailed cost information, industry officials said. The duties now are being assessed on a temporary basis, pending a final ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on whether the imports are injuring the domestic orange industry. The ITC ruled provisionally last June 18 that the domestic industry was being injured by Brazilian orange juice imports. A complaint that the Brazilian imports were being dumped at below costs on the U.S. market was filed on behalf of U.S. growers by the Florida Citrus Mutual, a Lakeland, Fla., group, Alcoma Packing Co, Inc, and Barry Citrus Products. U.S. officials say about half of the orange juice consumed in the United States comes from Brazil.  
label 27	U.S. RULING ON BRAZIL FCOJ MAY COME TOMORROW A decision on final dumping duties on frozen orange juice from Brazil may not be issued until tomorrow, Commerce Department officials said. They said the department has until midnight tonight to set the duty but may not make the finding public until tomorrow. A preliminary duty of 8.54 pct was set October 17, 1986. The final ruling will be based on more detailed information, the officials said.

label 27	TRADERS SAY USDA MAY LOWER ORANGE CROP ESTIMATE The U.S. Department of Agriculture will probably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orange crop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes, analysts and industry sources said. The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at 1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today. Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted. The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln boxes larger than they were. "They are going to cut their estimate," said Bob Tate, an FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. "The only question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this estimate." Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture clarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of Valencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted. "They'll temper it," said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. "The main drop will probably come in July." She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes.  
label 27	USDA ORANGE JUICE YIELD ESTIMATE The U.S. Agriculture Department projected an average yield of 1.47 gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice per box (42.0 degree brix equivalent) from Florida's 1986/87 crop. That compares with 1.46 gallons per box previously and 1.38 gallons per box from the 1985/86 crop. The crop reporting board said the estimates for the 1986/87 season are based on maturity and yields tests as of March 1.  
label 27	BRAZILIAN FCOJ OFFICIAL WELCOMES U.S. DUTY CUT Mario Branco Peres, president of the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries (Abrassuco), welcomed a decision by the U.S. Commerce Department sharply cutting its duties on imported frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil. Speaking by telephone from Sao Paulo, Peres said, "With its decision, the U.S. government recognised the honesty of Brazilian exporters, who never have the intention of practising dumping." In a final ruling yesterday, the U.S. government eliminated the duties shipped by Sucocitrico Cutrale and cut to 1.96 pct the duty on Citrosuco. Duties of 8.54 pct had been set last October. Peres said Brazil had enough orange juice to meet the needs of its major clients. "We do not have in stock what we would like to have, but we certainly have enough orange juice available to supply our buyers," Peres said, declining to estimate the amount of the current stock. "To keep it a secret is part of our strategy," he added. Peres said the price policy of the orange juice was based on market conditions. "There is nothing better than a free trade policy," he said. Cutrale and Citrosuco officials were not immediately available for comment.  
label 27	FCOJ MOVEMENT 3,915,370 GALLONS LAST WEEK Florida Citrus Processors Association said frozen concentrate orange juice movement into trade channels in the week ended March 7 totalled 3,915,370 gallons versus 3,956,126 gallons in the week ended February 28 and 4,284,693 gallons in the corresponding year-ago period. There were 3,814,891 gallons of foreign imports last week versus 133,505 gallons the week before. Domestic imports last week were 306,031. Retail movement was 1,652,916 versus 2,015,953 a year ago. Bulk movement was 1,934,494 against 1,954,103 a year earlier. Current season cumulative movement was 60,480,375 gallons versus 59,654,702 last year. Cumulative net pack for the season was 80,359,978 versus 74,071,755 a year ago. Inventory was 83,422,435 versus 81,963,040 a year ago.  
label 27	RAISE IN BRAZIL FCOJ EXPORT PRICES NOT CONFIRMED There is no confirmation that Brazil's major processors of Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice, FCOJ, will raise export prices of the product to 1,375 dlrs per tonne from April 1, a spokesman for the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries (Abrassuco) said. Asked to comment on a report from New York that Cutrale and Citrosuco had sent telexes to customers informing of the price raise, Jose Carlos Goncalves said Abrassuco was not aware of it. "All we know is that Cacex has increased the dollar amount to translate FOB price to ex-dock New York price to 1,050 dlrs from 770 dlrs," Goncalves said. Citrosuco and Cutrale officials were not available for comment.

label 28	U.K. RETAIL SALES RISE 2.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY The volume of U.K. Retail sales rose a provisional, seasonally adjusted 2.2 pct in February after falling a final 2.2 pct in January, figures released by the Department of Trade and Industry show. The February sales index, base 1980, was put at a preliminary 125.0 after a final 122.3 in January. In the three months from December to February, the level of sales was little changed over the previous three months but was nearly six pct higher than the same year ago period. On a non-seasonally adjusted value basis, retail sales in February were a provisional 9.0 pct higher than a year earlier. The Department noted the latest figures were similar to the average in the fourth quarter last year but well above the January index, which was depressed by the effects of severe weather. The February trading period comprised the four weeks February 1 to 28. Final February retail sales figures will be published on April 6.  
label 28	NEW ZEALAND RETAIL SALES SLOW IN JANUARY Seasonally adjusted retail sales rose by 0.1 pct in January, compared with increases of 5.7 pct in December and 1.0 pct a year earlier, the Statistics Department said. It said in a statement actual retail sales fell to 1.87 billion N.Z. Dlrs in January against 2.42 billion a month earlier and compared with 1.78 billion in January 1986. Year-on-year retail sales rose 5.3 pct compared with a 9.6 pct increase in the year-earlier period.

label 28	CANADA RETAIL SALES FALL 0.1 PCT IN JANUARY Canada's retail sales, seasonally adjusted, fell 0.1 pct in January after gaining 0.9 pct in December, Statistics Canada said. Retail sales fell to 11.98 billion dlrs from 11.99 billion dlrs in December, 1986. Unadjusted sales were 6.9 pct higher than in January, 1986. In January, automobile sales fell 1.9 pct, department store sales slipped 3.2 pct and variety stores sales plunged 14 pct. The declines were offset by a 5.5 pct increase in grocery store sales and a 9.9 pct gain in hardware sales.  
label 28	MAJOR HOME APPLIANCE SHIPMENTS UP IN FEBRUARY Shipments of major home appliances in February rose 9.1 pct to 3.5 mln, up from 3.2 mln a year ago, reported the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. It said year to date, total major appliance shipments rose 11.4 pct to 7.6 mln from 6.8 mln a year earlier. It said strong shipment gains in four of the five appliance categories resulted in the unprecedented monthly levels, with records set for shipments of refrigerators, automatic washers, disposers, dryers and dishwashers.  
label 28	FRENCH HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION FALLS IN FEBRUARY French household consumption of industrial goods fell 1.1 pct seasonally adjusted to 21.32 billion francs last month from 21.55 billion in January, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said. This brought consumption back down to the December 1986 level, it added. INSEE said that the fall was due to a sharp decline in purchases of clothing, which were high in January due to the cold weather. The decline was partly compensated by a small rise in purchases of durable goods.

label 28	U.S. FEB DURABLE GOODS ROSE 6.0 PCT New orders for durable goods received by U.S. manufacturers rose 5.7 billion dlrs, or 6.0 pct, in February to 101.2 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said. Excluding defense, orders rose 3.8 pct, compared with a revised January decline of 7.7 pct. In January, durable goods fell a revised 9.9 pct instead of the previously reported 7.5 pct. Durables excluding defense were reported originally as having fallen 9.9 pct in January. The Commerce Department on Monday revised orders statistics for 1982 to 1986 to reflect more current inventory valuation methods, and the February orders statistics are consistent with the revisions, officials said. The February order increase was led by transportation equipment, up 11.1 pct after an 18.0 pct decline in January. Orders for defense capital goods rose 48.9 pct to 6.9 billion dlrs, following a 38.8 pct decline in January. Non-defense capital goods orders fell 1.6 pct in February to 26.3 billion dlrs after falling 8.7 pct in January, the department said. Electrical machinery orders rose in February by 8.2 pct to 17.2 billion dlrs after falling 15.4 pct in January. Primary metals orders were up 13.9 pct to 8.4 billion dlrs after a 20 pct decline in January, the department said. New orders for non-electrical machinery were up in February by 3.9 pct to 16.6 billion dlrs after a three pct orders decline in January.  
label 28	GERMAN RETAILERS EXPECT GOOD 1987 West German retailers expect another good year in 1987 even though they will not be able to repeat the sharp increase in turnover they enjoyed in 1986, the General Association of the German Retail Trade (HDE) said. HDE President Wolfgang Hinrichs said retailers would be satisfied with a real turnover increase of between 2.5 pct to three pct in 1987 after last year's steep 3.7 pct rise. Hinrichs said the 1986 turnover increase had brought the first hesitant signs of improvement in earnings in the West German retail sector.  
label 29	GERMAN WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0.4 PCT IN FEBRUARY West German wholesale prices fell 0.4 pct in February from January to stand 6.9 pct lower than in February 1986, the Federal Statistics Office said. In January wholesale prices rose 0.8 pct from December to stand 8.6 pct below their level in January 1986. Wholesale price declines were led by starch products, down 13 pct, light heating oil 11 pct lower, heavy heating oil 10 pct lower and green coffee down 6.9 pct. Among higher wholesale prices were those for fresh vegetables, up 17 pct, fresh fruit up 12 pct and eggs up 8.9 pct, the statistics office said in a statement.  
label 29	SWISS WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0.3 PCT IN FEBRUARY Swiss wholesale prices fell by 0.3 pct in February, giving a drop of 4.3 pct from February 1986, the Federal Office of Industry, Trade and Labour said. Prices had been unchanged in January, giving an annual drop of 4.6 pct. They fell by 2.6 pct in the year to February 1986. The wholesale price index, base 1963, stood at 168.5 in February from 176.1 last year. The office said the fall was largely due to lower prices for energy, raw materials and semi-finished goods. Consumer goods prices rose slightly.  
label 29	S. AFRICAN PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION FALLS SHARPLY South African year-on-year producer price inflation fell to 14.9 pct in January against 16.4 pct in December, Central Statistics Office figures show. The all items index (base 1980) rose a monthly 0.8 pct in January to 233.9, after also rising 0.8 pct in December to 232.1. A year ago the index stood at 203.6 and year-on-year producer price inflation at 22.2 pct.

label 29	U.S. PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY The U.S. Producer Price Index for finished goods rose 0.1 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis in February, the Labor Department said. The increase came after a 0.6 pct increase in producer prices in January. Higher energy prices were primarily responsible for the increase in February, though they rose at a slower pace than they had in January, the department said. The finished goods index was up 0.1 pct from its February, 1986 level. Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100. Among finished goods, the index for energy products rose four pct in February after a 9.8 pct increase in January. But price increases slowed sharply for gasoline and home heating oil, the department said. There were some price declines, including a 3.4 pct fall for passenger cars and 1.3 pct for light trucks from January levels. This reflected expanded factory-financed rebates and discount loan programs, the department said. Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100.

The index for consumer foods fell 0.5 pct after a 1.8 pct drop in January as vegetables, pork and coffee cost less. The index for intermediate goods rose 0.5 pct following a sharp 0.9 pct rise in January. The department said that energy prices again were the main reason, with the index for intermediate energy up 2.7 pct. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices were about five pct higher, half the 10 pct jump recorded in January. The durable manufacturing materials index edged down 0.1 pct last month after jumping 1.0 pct in January as prices for steel, precious metals and copper stabilized. The department said lead and zinc prices fell, while hardwood lumber and cement cost more. The crude materials index rose 1.8 pct in February after a 2.9 pct rise in January. Crude energy materials were up 2.6 pct, much less than the 10 pct rise in January. Crude petroleum prices rose 4.4 pct last month after a sharp 19.7 pct rise in January. Price rises accellerated for logs and timber and tobacco, but fell for cotton, metal ores and copper and aluminum scrap. Among finished goods, gasoline rose 5.5 pct after a 15.7 pct January increase, and fuel oil was up three pct in February after an 18.0 pct increase in January.

label 29	JAPAN WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY Japan's overall wholesale price index (base 1980) fell 0.1 pct in February from a month earlier to 86.4 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall, the Bank of Japan said. Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December. The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21st straight year-on-year drop, the central bank said. The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from the recovery in world crude oil prices, it said. On a customs-cleared basis, crude oil prices rose to around 17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January. The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0.8 pct to 153.50 in February from 154.67 in January and was up 16.8 pct from 184.55 a year earlier, the bank said. The export price index in February fell 0.7 pct from a month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign competition. The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier. The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to 57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to the continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the index was down 29 pct from a year earlier. The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February, its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls in prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to severe sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices added to the decline. The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier. The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of 7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling such statistics in 1960 under its current system. Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected, the bank said.

The index, base 1980 equals 100, registered 172.8 in January compared with 170.9 in December. The January 1987 figure represents a fall over January 1986 of 1.7 pct after a year-on-year decrease in December 1986 of 2.5 pct.  
label 29	GERMAN PRODUCER PRICES FALL 0.3 PCT IN FEBRUARY West German producer prices fell 0.3 pct in February from January and were 4.2 pct below prices in February last year, the Federal Statistics Office said. In January, producer prices rose 0.2 pct from December, the first monthly rise since October 1985, but they were down 4.4 pct from a year earlier. The Statistics Office said light heating oil producer prices fell 22 pct in February from January while heavy heating oil prices fell 24 pct.  
label 30	COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS The European Community's farmers' pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax which has already been proposed by the EC Commission. Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism for cereal substitutes. He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair meetings of their EC colleagues. Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers. This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions. A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC price fixing. However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax. Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between EC and world prices.  
label 30	OILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87 Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October 1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with 10.6 mln a year earlier. Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun, rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil, lard and tallow/greases. Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987, compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the previous two seasons. It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand for both food and non-food purposes, it said. World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic demand. Oil World said it did not expect the European Community (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.  
label 30	U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN A meeting among government agencies today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European Community, U.S. trade officials said. Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure on EC member states. "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S. trade official. One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great cost." U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up. "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on its farm price package. Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said "sometimes its better not to be specific." U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.  
label 30	BRITISH MINISTER CRITICISES PROPOSED EC OILS TAX A British minister said that a proposed European Community tax on vegetable oils and fats would raise the price of fish and chips and he pledged the government would fight against it. Lord Belstead, a junior agriculture minister, told the House of Lords the tax would raise the price of raw materials used in many processed foods by about 100 pct. He said revenue should not be raised by taxing the consumer and called the proposal "repugnant."  
label 30	CCC REALLOCATES CREDIT GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, has reallocated two mln dlrs in credit gurantees previously earmarked for sales of U.S. protein meals to cover sales of vegetable oil and tallow to El Salvador, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The action reduces coverage for sales of protein meals to 14 mln dlrs from 16 mln dlrs and creates new lines of one mln dlrs for tallow and/or greases and one mln dlrs for vegetable oils, the department said. All sales under the credit guarantee lines must be registered and exported by Sepember 30, 1987, it said. The guarantee rates include a charge to provide for a yearly interest rate coverage of up to 4.5 pct on the guaranteed value, the department said.

label 30	YEUTTER REPEATS RETALIATION THREAT ON EC OIL TAX U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States will retaliate if the European Community adopts a proposed tax on vegetable oils, but he did not say what EC products would be singled-out for reprisal. Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention here, Yeutter said he is "cautiously optimistic" the controversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers. Yeutter said the proposed tax is a "flagrant violation of the spirit of GATT" because it would imperil the zero binding duty on U.S. exports of soybeans to Europe. He said the Reagan administration has yet to decide on a retaliation list. The administration would not reveal a retaliation list unless the EC approved the proposal, he said.

The official, who asked not to be identified, dismissed a report circulating in markets today that the interagency trade policy review group had rejected the proposals. Under the proposals, USDA would offer vegetable oil under the export enhancement program, EEP, to four countries, including 80,000 tonnes to Turkey and 60,000 tonnes to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, industry sources said. The proposals "are still under review" by the interagency working group, the USDA official said.  
label 30	EC OILS TAX NO LONGER MAJOR ISSUE - ASSOCIATION The proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said. Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference the West German feed industry believes the EC does not seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it would end in another transatlantic trade war. "We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies." American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers were confident the tax would be rejected. Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn on Thursday and Friday. There are indications the Bonn government will also reject the proposed tax, Wagner said.
