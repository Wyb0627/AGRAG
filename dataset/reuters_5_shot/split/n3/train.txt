label 16	PAKISTAN COTTON CROP SEEN RECORD 7.6 MLN BALES Pakistan is likely to produce a record 7.6 mln bales (375 lbs each) of cotton from the current 1986/87 crop, exceeding a target of 7.2 mln bales, Food and Agriculture Minister Mohammad Ibrahim Baluch said. He told a Pakistan Central Cotton Committee meeting here the present was the third consecutive poroduction record-setting year and said the momentum would be accelerated in the future, the official APP news agency reported. Baluch said indications were that Pakistan is to attain a record cotton production of 7.6 mln bales, compared to the 1985/86 crop of 7.2 mln bales which also represented the target earlier set by authorities for this year's production.

label 16	BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis), the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report. The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region. The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes -- 25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate. Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have affected quality, the report said. Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

label 18	FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of growth in the money supply this year. "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif. A text was released in Washington. He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished. "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January. "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well," he added. Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation. "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future," he said. Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers. "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned. He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes. "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets," Heller said. He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada. A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller said.

label 19	TECK STILL IN TALKS ON B.C. COPPER VENTURE &lt;Teck Corp> said it was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco Ltd &lt;CLT> and &lt;Lornex Mining Corp>, but did not know when negotiations would be completed. Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long time." He declined to speculate on the outcome. Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don Townson told Reuters. "I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be resolved," Cominco's Townson said. "We're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end. Cominco and Teck's 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January 1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley copper operations. Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct. For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct copper, Townson said. Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of gold, he said.

Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as 24 hours before they were brought to safety. Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor belt. Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine. Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone will not be completed before the end of April. Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting an investigation into the fire. Production at the mine has been suspended until the investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680 people. The smelter continues to operate with available concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said. Reuter

All deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract (min 99.5 pct), the LME said. Sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard contract until September 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not good delivery and cannot be placed on LME warrant. The dollar quotation for the high grade contract will be in multiples of one U.S. Dollar but carries may be made at 50 cents for even tonnages only. Singapore, which is the first port warehouse outside Europe to be used as an LME delivery point, will be used for high grade metal only and the rent imposed by owners Steinweg will be 1.05 U.S. Dlr a tonne per week, the LME said. The LME Board, in response to representation from the trade, agreed to annul from LME contracts the minimum weight requirements of 450 kilos for T-bars and 250 kilos for sows, effective for high grade on June 1 and for standard on July 24.

It said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost while maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. The frame has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Ford said.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smaller powertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and improving fuel economy. Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000 dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for steel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of welds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.

label 21	MAJOR RUBBER PRODUCERS TO MEET IN SINGAPORE Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said. The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said. This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading centre. The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be discussed. Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva. The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.

label 22	MALAYSIA SEEKS 42 BILLION YEN PIPELINE LOAN Malaysia has asked Japan for a 42 billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas pipelines from eastern Trengganu to southern Johor, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) said. OECF's chief representative, Takashi Matsuya, told reporters the Japanese Government is appraising the loan. Another OECF official told Reuters Japan is likely to approve the loan because "it is technically and economically viable." If approved, the loan would carry a coupon rate of four pct, a grace period of seven years, Matsuya said. It would be disbursed over three years, he added. The pipeline contruction is the second phase of the Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project by Petronas, Malaysia's national oil company.

label 22	STATOIL SEEKS SHARE IN THAI GAS FIELD Norway's state oil company Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>, has told Thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a big offshore Thailand gas field, Statoil said. The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand, is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd &lt;VO.N>. Thailand's state oil company &lt;Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a major stake in the field. PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed. PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's holdings in the field. "PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific. When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking over a 30 pct share in the field," Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen told Reuters. Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost of some 700 mln crowns. Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its upgraded reserve estimate for the field. The field's reserves could be sold domestically through Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to electricity, the sources said. Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.  
label 22	COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY Columbia Gas Transmission corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts. Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period, beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April 10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas, Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April 1985. The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct of its total available gas supply this year.

label 23	U.K. RESERVES SHOW RECORD UNDERLYING RISE IN MAY Britain's gold and currency reserves rose a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's 2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said. The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs. The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68 billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April. Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln dlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were 85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments of eight mln, after three mln last month. Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs. The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and repayments. It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs rise seen in October 1977.

"Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance between the purchase and sale of foreign securities," the statement added.
