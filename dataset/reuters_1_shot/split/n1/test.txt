label 0	CANADA FEBRUARY TRADE SURPLUS 1.2 BILLION DLRS Canada had a trade surplus of 1.25 billion dlrs in February compared with an upward revised 623 mln dlrs surplus in January, Statistics Canada said. The January surplus originally was reported at 533 mln dlrs. The February surplus last year was 189 mln dlrs. February exports, seasonally adjusted, were 10.44 billion dlrs against 9.85 billion in January and 10.05 billion in February, 1986. February imports were 9.19 billion dlrs against 9.23 billion in January and 9.86 billion in February, 1986.  
label 0	EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS The European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains. Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S. The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices. Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese. The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified. The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market.  
label 0	SPRINKEL SAYS TAX HIKE WOULD NOT REDUCE DEFICIT Council of Economic Advisers chairman Beryl Sprinkel said the Reagan Administration remains strongly opposed to a tax increase, including 18 billion dlrs of new revenues in the budget plan by Congressional Democrats. "We believe that significant increases in taxes would not reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth," Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee. He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of gradually reducing deficits through restraining government spending and promoting economic growth. Sprinkel said cutting the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.  
label 0	CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY Canada's trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year. The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year. "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month. "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its monthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's Donegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn. Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory."

Exports in february totalled 379.4 mln dlrs, 17.2 pct above the january figure. Imports fell 9.2 pct from the previous month to 277.2 mln dlrs. The figures for the same month last year were 314 mln and 208.6 mln dlrs, respectively. The accumulated trade surplus over the first two months of 1987 stands at 120.4 mln dlrs against 132.8 mln dlrs the previous year.  
label 0	JAPAN WARNS U.S. IT MAY RETALIATE IN TRADE DISPUTE Japan warned the United States it may take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government official said. Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week. However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday. Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods. Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.  
label 0	TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States. Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington. "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States," he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show. Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials. The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada. Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property. "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.  
label 0	BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS A British minister said he had given the Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets "and it was clearly understood." Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" about access to their own markets. At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed. "I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood." Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain. "It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds." "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use them." He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship. "I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets." On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case. He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said. Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners. Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened.

It said exports over the period rose by 8.7 pct to 12.38 billion dlrs and imports by 8.9 pct to 14.64 billion for a trade deficit of 2.26 billion, against a 2.06 billion deficit in the same 1986 period and 1.78 billion deficit previously. The growth was attributed to the strength of non-oil trade, especially computers and computer parts, electronic components and garments, it said.

The improved export performance was led by electrical and electronic products, textiles, footwear, clothing, processed food, timber, chemical and rubber products, he told a news conference. However, total gross exports for the year declined by 5.6 pct to 35.9 billion ringgit from 38 billion in 1985 due to a fall in major commodity exports and weak prices, he said.

Grain mill product loadings in the week totalled 11,382 cars, down 1.8 pct from the previous week but 7.6 pct above the same week a year earlier, the association said.  
label 1	GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it.  
label 1	SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half," Martell said.  
label 1	U.S. CONGRESS TO LOOK AT SOIL PROGRAM EXEMPTIONS The Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from government conservation regulations those farmers who have rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with row crops, committee staff said. Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years. Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops.  
label 1	IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING The government daily Izvestia said a considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil. Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring." The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill. A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years. "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple," Izvestia said. This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.  
label 1	U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement. Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop. An official from a leading conservation group, who asked not to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunate first action" because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations, established under the 1985 farm bill.  
label 1	RENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN Prospects for renewal of the five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview. The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975. Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was. "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices," Melnikov said. "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said. Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement. "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said.

The officials said discussion of a U.S. Agriculture Department wheat export subsidy to the Soviet Union was not on the agenda. Matters not on the agenda, however, can be brought before the council, the officials said. Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow, but USDA officials have said the matter is not under active consideration. USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative proposals, including bills that would cut target prices and speed up loan rate reductions.

label 2	U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS U.S. military forces in the Mideast Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to "non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today. "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting all shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the protective U.S. military presence in the gulf. Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq. "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region," Sims said. U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere. He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war. Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack. Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11 Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional ships and air cover are under consideration.  
label 2	LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES House Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt. The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. Since the administration made known its reflagging plans, congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted, and some charged the policy could lead the United States into the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq. The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf. The resolution was expected to pass without controversy today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution. Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.  
label 2	U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions. The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf. It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy. The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature. Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy. But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report.  
label 2	U.S. HOUSE PASSES MIDEAST GULF BILL The House today approved a bill requiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on its Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions. The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said he would try to prevent consideration of the bill. He said he will put a so-called "hold" on the bill until he finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting Kuwaiti tankers. Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war. Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to war. "It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will blow sky-high at worst," said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth.

The backlog of orders at end-May was 122 ships of 3.70 mln gt against 125 ships of 3.73 mln at end-April and 233 ships of 5.99 mln a year ago, an association official said. The world shipping recession and the yen's appreciation against the dollar depressed May orders, he said.

She said Evergreen will use the funds raised from the stock market to buy new ships and step up its global services. The spokeswoman said the company posted an after-tax profit of more than one billion dlrs last year on total revenues of 20.46 billion, compared to an after-tax profit of 1.18 billion on revenues of 17.99 billion in 1985. Evergreen has placed newbuilding orders for three 3,428-teu (twenty-foot equivalent unit) fully cellular container ships with the state-owned &lt;China Shipbuilding Corp> for delivery in late 1988.

The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and Xingang last month. Bi Yueran, managing director of China State Shipbuilding Corp's ship repair department, told the newspaper the Soviet Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600 ships deployed in the far east.

label 3	HOMESTAKE MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES Homestake Mining Co is considering acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters in an interview. Conger said, "the move to consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's acquistions policy." Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120 mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition, Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an acquisition, he said. Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6 pct. Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces. However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400 ounces due to start-up production problems. He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400 U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.  
label 3	RENISON GC AND CITY RESOURCES SET PNG GOLD VENTURE Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd &lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) and explorer &lt;City Resources Ltd> have agreed in principle on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial gold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said. City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of RGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement. It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a total of 2.1 mln ounces. City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres. In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator. The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first successful gold mining operation of &lt;Placer Development Ltd> after it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field until dredging ceased in 1967.

It said the workers, represented by United Steelworkers of America, would receive a 1.21 dlr an hour pay raise over the life of the new contract and improved benefits. Northgate, which produced 23,400 ounces of gold in first quarter, said that while the strike slowed production, "We are still looking forward to a very satisfactory performance." The Chibougamau mines produced 81,500 ounces of gold last year.

label 3	SKYLINE &lt;SKX.V> EXPECTS TO BEGIN MINE IN JULY Skyline Explorations Ltd said expects construction can begin next month on a gold mine at Johnny Mountain Camp, located 600 miles north of Vancouver. The company said a contract has been let for a 200 to 400 tons per day mill and the company is receiving cooperation from provincial and federal agencies on its stage one report, "approval in principal," which is required before actual construction can begin. Skyline said it is optimistic the approval in principal will be received in late June, by which time it expects to have confirmed threshold tonnage and grade targets so construction can begin in July.  Skyline said the 1987 exploration drift on 16 vien east at Johnny Mountain has advanced 320 feet. The vein is continuous, averaging four feet thick plus an altered mineralized hanging wall. It said periodic face samples indicate an average grade of 1.05 ounces per ton of ore ranging from a low of 0.78 ounce per ton to a high of 55.8 ounces per ton.

The range of the value of the reserves is attributed to the wide range of grade estimates of the ore, the company said. A 1984 feasibility study put the grade at 0.008 ounces per cubic yard, while subsequent exploration work proved that areas of higher-grade gravel of up to 0.027 ounces/yard do exist, Sphinx said. The claims are located 80 miles northwest of Fairbanks.  
label 3	SWEDEN'S BOLIDEN TO OPEN SAUDI ARABIAN GOLD MINE Mining group Boliden AB said it had agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal. Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish group would  be responsible for the technical side of the operation and would have no control over the product itself. He said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in northern Sweden. Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased Boliden's presence in Saudi Arabia. "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the future," he said. The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said. Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to open in modern times. "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining technology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, Kjell Nilsson.

label 4	PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it," Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.

label 5	ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.  
label 5	(RPT) U.S. SAYS TIN DISPOSALS WILL NOT AFFECT ACCORD U.S. tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, a government official said. The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile. "We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said Thomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the State Department. Last year the United States released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.  
label 5	ZAIRE ACCEPTS TIN-EXPORT QUOTA, ATPC SAYS Zaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb exports, the ATPC said. ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March 1. Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes. The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices. All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year. The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire. China and Bolivia, important producers of tin, are not members.  
label 5	THAI TIN EXPORTS RISE IN JANUARY Thailand exported 1,816 tonnes of tin metal in January, up from 1,731 in December and 1,330 a year ago, the Mineral Resources Department said. It said major buyers last month were Singapore, Japan, Britain, the Netherlands, Malaysia and the U.S.  
label 5	BULLETIN SAYS TIN PRICE MAY RISE TO 20 RINGGIT The tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin said. The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang. It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump. The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said. A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added. "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said.  
label 5	BOLIVIAN TIN MINERS START HUNGER STRIKE About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation Comibol went on hunger strike to press for higher wages, a miners union spokesman said. Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the miners union, told a news conference the strikers began to fast in the major tin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action would spread tomorrow to la paz and other areas. The government has charged that the strike by the miners union, crippled by massive layoffs, is part of a left-wing destabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives on a four-day official tour on Friday. But miners union chief Simon Reyes told reporters the strike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press for more government investment in Comibol. The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro has streamlined the deficit-ridden state mining corporation laying off about 20,000 miners, two-thirds of the workforce, following a collapse of the international tin price in 1985.  
label 5	BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said. It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers' demands. The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday. The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday. The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its deficit-ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin. The lay-offs represent about two-thirds of the original workforce.

label 5	MAJOR TIN CENTERS PARALYSED BOLIVIA UNION SAYS A strike by 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation Comibol has paralysed tin production in the major centers of Huanuni, Corocoro, Siglo, Catavi and Colquiri, the Conflicts Secretary of the Bolivian Miners Federation, Cristobal Aranibar, told Reuters. The strike began at midnight to press demands for higher wages and more funds for the nationalised mining industry. The miners federation left the door open to negotiations with the government but "only if the authorities show their intention to find solution to our demands", Aranibar said. The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has said the miners strike was part of a campaign to discredit it during the visit of West German president, Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives today for a four-day official visit. The government froze salaries as part of its efforts to pull Bolivia out of a deep economic crisis. According to central bank forecasts inflation will reach an annual 10 pct rate versus up to 20,000 pct in 1985. In addition to the miners' strike, about 1,000 railway factory workers of the bolivian labour organization (COB) began a second day of a hunger strike in the country's main cities to press for substantial wage increases, a union leader said.  
label 5	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA Bolivia, once Latin America's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports. The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.  
label 6	SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987 The Soviet Union's industrial output is growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show. Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2 pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last year's calculations of industrial output included all goods, irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000 people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector, Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the economy has been an important part of the modernisation campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in the West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5 mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against 194 roubles a year ago.

The rise was led by price gains for papers, pharmaceuticals and petroleum and coal products. Price declines were recorded for meat products, lumber and motor vehicles. On a year over year basis, the federal agency said the index fell 0.9 pct in January, the largest yearly decline on record.  
label 6	EC INDUSTRY OUTPUT GROWTH SLOWS IN 1986 European Community industrial output increased by an average of around two pct last year, compared with 3.3 pct growth recorded in 1985 against a year earlier, the EC statistics office Eurostat said. Growth was highest in Portugal at five pct, while in Greece output contracted by 0.3 pct, Eurostat said in a statement. Eurostat noted output growth also fell in the U.S. And Japan. U.S. Production increased 1.1 pct after 2.0 pct in 1985, while in Japan output contracted by 0.5 pct after rising 4.5 pct a year earlier. Eurostat said EC industrial production in December rose 3.1 pct compared with 12 months earlier but added that after adjustment for seasonal factors, output growth had been clearly slowing down since the beginning of the summe  
label 6	CANADA INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION UP 2.53 PCT Canadian industrial production rose 2.53 pct in December after falling 0.51 pct in November, Statistics Canada said. The federal agency said year-over-year production was off 0.65 pct in December, compared with a decline of 1.65 pct in November.  
label 6	SWISS INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES IN FOURTH QQUARTER Swiss industrial output rose nine pct in the fourth quarter last year after a four pct third quarter decline, and was up three pct from the final three months of 1985, the Federal Office of Industry, Trade and Labour said. For the full year 1986 the index, base 1963, stood at 166 after up four pct from the 159 recorded the previous year. Incoming orders gained four pct in the quarter after a five pct third quarter fall and were up one pct from the year earlier level. In the full year they gained one pct.

label 6	CHINESE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH RATE UP AFTER WEAK 1986 The value of China's industrial output in January and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the same 1986 period, the New China News Agency said. Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January 1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986. The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to last year's poor performance. "No significant improvement was made in economic results," it said, adding that some successes were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the last quarter of 1986. The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986. It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987 industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway throughout the country. It gave no more details. The official industrial growth target this year is seven pct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year.

label 6	U.S. FEB INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ROSE 0.5 PCT U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct in February after a revised 0.1 pct increase in January, the Federal Reserve Board said. The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pct in January. The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharp rise in motor vehicle production, which boosted output of both consumer goods and business equipment. Industrial production stood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up 1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said. The Fed also revised the December industrial production figure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported. Manufacturing output rose 0.5 pct in February after a 0.1 pct increase in January and included gains of 0.8 pct in durables and 0.1 pct in non-durables, the Fed said. Manufacturing was 2.4 pct above the year ago level. Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 8.3 mln units last month from a January rate of 7.5 mln units. Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pct in January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct in February after falling by 2.0 pct in January. Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February, reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fed said. Mining output rose 0.1 pct after a 1.6 pct increase in January, but was still six pct lower than a year ago. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after a 1.2 pct rise in January. Output of defense and space equipment was up 0.4 pct, the same as in January, and 6.2 pct higher than a year ago. Output of construction supplies rose 0.2 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January rise. Materials output increased by 0.2 pct last month, the fourth consecutive monthly increase after declining throughout much of 1986. The recent strength in materials has been concentrated in textiles, paper and chemicals, the Fed said. Output of home goods was up 0.3 pct in February and the Fed said production of items like appliances and furniture continued strong last month.
