label 16	PAKISTAN COTTON OUTPUT REACHES 7.7 MLN BALES Pakistan cotton production during the current crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375 pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairman of the Agricultural Prices Commission, said. Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mln bales of cotton during the current financial year ending June after 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85. They said consumption would increase due to a rise in demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistan produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and exported 157 mln. The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely to export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year compared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said. The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales last year.  
label 16	S.KOREA TO BUY MORE COTTON, ESPECIALLY U.S. COTTON South Korea plans to import about 387,000 tonnes of cotton this year compared to 225,000 tonnes in 1986, trade ministry officials said. More than three quarters of the total, some 290,000 tonnes, will come from the United States. That will be a 93.7 pct increase on 1986 when U.S. Imports totalled 150,000 tonnes, an official said. He said the U.S. Increase is due partly to the competitiveness of American cotton and partly to efforts by Seoul to reduce its trade surplus with Washington. South Korea is the second largest importer of U.S. Cotton after Japan.  
label 16	INDIA 1986/87 COTTON EXPORT QUOTA UP 190,000 BALES India's raw cotton export quota has been raised by 190,000 170-kg bales to 600,000 bales in 1986/87 ending August, still well below the 1985/86 quota of 1.35 mln bales, Minister of State for Textiles R.N. Mirdha said. State and private agencies contracted to export 1.34 mln bales in 1985/86, he told journalists. But only 433,000 bales were shipped that year, with the rest to be delivered in 1986/87. About 758,000 bales from 1985/86 contracts were shipped up to February 2 in 1986/87. The government will export 600,000 bales of long and extra- long staple cotton in the three years from 1986/87, he said.

Varieties of the deadly disease attack major cash crops such as cotton, vegetables, orchard trees, citrus fruits, and garden plants, the company said.  
label 16	CHINA TRYING TO INCREASE COTTON OUTPUT, PAPER SAYS China's 1987 cotton output must rise above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall short of increasing demand, the China Daily said. Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985. Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily attributed the decline to several factors, including less favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks. According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985. To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota levels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally contracted for, it added. The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south China should be maintained, and growing in the north should be concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang. It called for comprehensive planning to coordinate production of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and other crops, but gave no more details.  
label 16	U.S. COTTON CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION DATE EXTENDED Expiration dates on upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are being extended, the Agriculture Department announced. The certificates are being extended because of a shortage of Commodity Credit Corporation inventory available for exchange with certificates, USDA undersecretary Danial Amstutz said. Presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine months from the last day of the month of issuance. Under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program will have an expiration date of either February 29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.  
label 16	ISRAEL'S FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO BOOST AGRICULTURE Israel has drawn up a five-year plan for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs to 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be increased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average. The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in 80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985 level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in force, the ministry said. Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000 tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82 pct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or 48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct.

The bureau said upland cotton ginnings from the final 1986 crop totaled 9,237,296 bales, vs 12,837,088 bales in 1985 and 12,418,749 bales in 1984. American Pima ginnings from the final 1986 crop totaled 201,129 bales, vs 150,746 bales in the 1985 crop and 126,117 bales in 1984, the bureau said.  
label 16	ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop. "With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap," said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists. Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage, analysts said. They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government will not pick up the tab for storage. Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program, which could result in more cotton. "The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of 25 pct of a farmer's base acreage," noted Judy Weissman of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have. Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program. "Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct," said one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its annual meeting in late January. But others disagreed. "I think some Western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons. There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market," said Walter Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer. Some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting intentions report. "Anything the USDA is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced (on March 20)," one analyst cautioned. She said traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9. Brown took that opinion a step further. "I don't think planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment rate," the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested. Brown said the abandonment rate this year was "pretty high" at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states. "More normal would be about six pct," he said.  
label 16	LITTLE RISK SEEN FOR TEXAS COTTON FROM COLD Texas' cotton crop stands little chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according to Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts. "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct of the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann, a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in Austin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department. Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to begin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for 60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year, Stillmann said. Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande Valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s, according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc. The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futures market rallied today on weather-related fears.

Frozen pork belly stocks at 34.5 mln lbs on March 1 compared with a revised 34.9 mln lbs on February 1 for a net out movement of 0.5 mln lbs. The number on hand compared with trade guesses of 33.5 to 36 mln lbs and the year ago figure of 51.2 mln lbs. Traders said the figure was toward the upper end of expectations and may provide slight downward pressure because of recent sharp gains in futures.

label 17	LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM COLD STORAGE REPORT The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said. The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said. "I think the market is going to be looking at some other things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might be early next week," Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH Miller, said. Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week. "We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex," Levitt said. Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings, they said. However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation. Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri, said, "I would not look for (belly) storage during the next month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be less."

Rain was reported across parts of Minnesota, Iowa, eastern Kansas, Missouri and eastern Oklahoma, with showers and a few thundershowers extending from Arkansas through the lower Mississippi Valley to Alabama and northwest Florida. Strong winds of 20 to 35 mph with some stronger gusts were reported across much of the Plains, causing considerable blowingand drifting snow. A blizzard warning continued this morning across most of western Kansas. A winter storm warning was issued this morning over central and northeast Nebraska. Weather advisories were posted for this morning over central Kansas and central and southeast sections of South Dakota where two to five inches of snow could accumulate. Locally heavy rains accompanied the storm over portions of the central Plains. Flash flood watches were issued for this morning across the eastern half of Kansas. A flood warning continues today for eastern Nebraska. Widespread lowland and small stream flooding is expected to continue over most of eastern Nebraska through Wednesday. Due to cold, damp and windy conditions, livestock advisories were posted this morning across central and southeast portions of South Dakota. As the storm moves north across the central Plains, winter storm watches were issued over south central South Dakota, late tonight and Wednesday over west central Minnesota. Elsewhere, a travelers advisory remains in effect this morning over northeast New Mexico and the Oklahoma and Tecas Panhandle for blowing snow and slick roadways and across the mountains and deserts of southern California for strong gusty winds of 25 to 40 mph. Gale warnings were issued for today along the central California Coast.

The seasonally adjusted March average of M-2 plus CDs rose 0.8 pct from February when it rose an identical 0.8 pct from a month earlier, it said. Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs stood at an average 343,600 billion yen in March compared with 336,015 billion in February.

Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year earlier, it said. The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.

The Fed said that business loans including acceptances fell 1.1 billion dlrs to 278.67 billion dlrs.  
label 18	FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY U.S. banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit, economists said. "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes. As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so. "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture." Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar's fall gathers pace. Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.  
label 18	AUSTRALIA'S M-3 MONEY SUPPLY RISE 1.5 PCT IN MARCH Australia's M-3 money supply growth was 1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the Reserve Bank said. This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February. The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected by the start of the operations of &lt;National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd. The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77 billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986. M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and savings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.

M-3 rose to a revised 82.38 billion rand in April from a preliminary 82.17 billion and March's revised 81.39 billion. In April last year M-3 stood at 74.64 billion rand.

label 19	CIPEC STUDYING COPPER MARKET BACKWARDATION The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the current backwardation in world copper market prices but does not envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources here said. The organisation's executive and marketing committees reviewed the current market situation during a series of meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions. The sources noted that the backwardation - premium of nearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks and is the longest on record. "It's unusual," one official said, but added CIPEC did not have any immediate recipe to remedy the situation. The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of CIPEC's regional copper development and promotion centres, which are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil. Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual ministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in late September.

label 19	COPPER STUDY GROUP CONSIDERED AT GENEVA MEETING Major copper producing and consuming countries are considering a U.S. proposal to set up a study group to review the world copper market, delegates said. The U.S. initiative was introduced last December at a meeting held here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The U.S., the world's largest copper consumer and second biggest producer after Chile, has proposed setting up a body to improve statistics and market transparency of the copper economy, and provide a forum for discussion. The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to stabilise depressed world prices. This week's meeting, which began yesterday, is due to end Friday.

label 20	VENEZUELAN ALUMINUM FIRM TO CREDITS the venezuelan state aluminum company venalum is negotiating a total of 123.9 mln dlr in credits from abroad for a planned expansion of production faciities, finance minister manuel azpurua said. Azpurua spoke to reporters after meeting representatives of the kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau (kfw) bank of germany, who tommorrow will sign a agreement to grant 100 mln marks (54.9 mln US dlrs) in credits to venalum. The agreement will have an eight and one-half year term and a fixed interest rate of 6.13 pct. Azpurua said venalum is negotiating credits of 14.9 mln dlrs from the swiss bank corporation, 14 mln dlrs from mitsubishi of japan and 40 mln dlrs from eksportfinans of norway. "this proves we are achieving our goal of reestablishing the financial flows to the country," said azpurua. The credits would go to the installation of a fifth production line in venalum, one of three state aluminum companies, which produces primarily for the export market.

With the restart of this 22,700-metric-tonne-per-year line, Reynolds said, it will be operating at 100 pct of its consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per year. Reynolds said work will commence on the potline restart in the near future and it is expected that actual metal production will begin on September one. The company said the start up was necessitated by continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds' various fabricating businesses.

label 20	INDONESIA RAISES STAKE IN ALUMINIUM PLANT Indonesia has increased its share in a 434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from 25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud said. The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake. The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen. Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in dollars. Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne. Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant, situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.  
label 20	JAPAN APPROVES AID FOR INDONESIA, BRAZIL ALUMINIUM Japan's cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said. Japan will invest 24 billion yen in &lt;PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested in the company. The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment, he said. They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested. The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the official said. Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be reached, industry sources said. Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia's investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct. The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51 pct, the official said. The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium. Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they said.  
label 20	ALCAN RAISES ALUMINUM PRICES TWO CENTS A LB Alcan Aluminum Corp, a subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium Ltd, said it increased its U.S. primary aluminum prices by two cents a lb, effective yesterday. The new prices are 72 cents a lb for ingot and 80 cents for extrusion billet, the company said.  
label 20	CHINA ALUMINIUM VENTURE AIMS AT SOUTH KOREA China and Australia's Victoria state signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium processing plant in China that will export to South Korea, Australian officials told journalists. China has no official direct trade or government ties with Seoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea. China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in &lt;Bohai Aluminium Industries Ltd>, the company to build the rolling mill and extrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said. It was China's largest joint venture so far, they said. "A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China)," Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said. An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South Korean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is growing but is not officially publicised. Victoria's &lt;Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government, will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is intended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminium smelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in Portland. The China-based joint venture would process Portland aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said. The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22 mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key managers, he said. Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment in Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level of independence from Peking's central government and has extensive overseas investments.

Nippon, which has no plans to restore output to the 48,000 tonnes a year at which it was working until late 1986, will become Japan's only smelter. &lt;Ryoka Light Metal Industries Ltd> will stop smelting in April owing to high power costs and low prices, and &lt;Mitsui Aluminium Co Ltd> has said it stopped smelting in February.

Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant. But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to 10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now, he said.  
label 21	LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus "corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had," one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages," one official said. "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said.  
label 21	THAI NATURAL RUBBER EXPORTS RISE IN 1986 Thai natural rubber exports rose to 763,331 tonnes in 1986 from 689,964 a year earlier, the private Board of Trade said. Japan, the biggest buyer, imported 384,622 tonnes of Thai rubber in 1986, up from 348,855 the previous year, it said. Other major buyers were the U.S. At 86,383 tonnes, up from 81,629 in 1985, China 69,952 (60,296) and West Germany 32,172 (25,909). Exports to France rose to 20,479 tonnes from 12,143 in 1985, Austria 6,048 (4,104), and Italy 4,014 tonnes (1,340).  
label 21	MALAYSIA SAYS RUBBER PACT DEPENDS ON CONSUMERS Malaysia said the success of talks opening today on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) depends on how flexible consumer countries are. Rubber producer and consumer countries meet for 12 days in Geneva from tomorrow to try to hammer out a rubber pact after they failed to reach agreement last November to replace the current accord, which expires next October. Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said in a statement that Malaysia wants to continue with a second INRA and is prepared to accept modifications that would strengthen the present agreement. He said the second INRA would allow for an orderly disposal of the accumulated buffer stock of 375,000 tonnes, since the market is now capable of absorbing such releases.  
label 21	RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS The chairman of the conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week. The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, "I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned." "It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed." He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic "that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled." Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile. Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality, he said, "There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement."  
label 21	RUBBER LEAF DISEASE SEEN AFFECTING SUPPLY/PRICES The leaf disease corenes pora, which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said. Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters. He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued. Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444, 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said. Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. "The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise," he said. He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation.  
label 21	PROGRESS AT RUBBER PACT TALKS REPORTED SLOW Negotiators at a United Nations conference on natural rubber are making slow progress towards reaching an agreement, delegates said. The conference, which began Monday, is widely seen as the final effort to adopt a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) before the current one expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. This is the fourth such conference in nearly two years. Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key issue of the price adjustment mechanism. Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of 18 months as at present, a proposal currently rejected by producers. And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be automatic, producers have resisted reducing the role of the International Rubber Organization Council in the price adjustment procedure. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has said it was "imperative" to settle outstanding issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week.  
label 21	RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said. "There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet," he said. The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" (or "must sell") levels without changing the "lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, and of the "lower indicative price" if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.  
label 21	NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance, delegates said. Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, "There is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good." The discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the "lower indicative price," under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" or "must sell" levels, without changing the "lower indicative price" -- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current pact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.  
label 22	TENNECO &lt;TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also transport its own gas to customers. Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for gas it has bought but could not sell. The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access. Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to open-access because of the take-or-pay issue. But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the steps FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even before all transitional problems are solved." A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from Louisiana and Texas up to New England. "We remain convinced that the most critical transitional issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by FERC in the near future. "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the industry's continued ability to provide its customers with reliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co president R.C. Thomas.  
label 22	BROOKLYN UNION &lt;BU> TO BUY GAS FROM SHELL OIL Brooklyn Union Gas Co said it has contracted to purchase up to 60 mln cubic feet of natural gas per day from Shell Oil Co, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC> subsidiary. Brooklyn Union said the long-term contract will cover about 15 pct of its total supplies. A spokesman said Shell and the utility agreed to not disclose the length of the contract or the price of the gas, which he described as competitive with a market sensitive escalation formula.  Brooklyn Union said the gas from Shell Oil will replace about 25 pct of the gas previously supplied by Transco Energy Inc's &lt;E> Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp subsidiary. The utility said Transcontinental will transport the gas being purchased from Shell Oil, possibly beginning as soon as November 1.  
label 22	LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987 Liquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year. "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment,"  Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson's Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values.

In a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Trunkline said, it is reducing its commodity rate -- the portion of the total rate based on the price of gas -- to 2.58 dlrs per mln Btu from 2.69 dlrs per mln Btu. The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.  
label 22	STANDARD OIL &lt;SRD> IN TEXAS NATURAL GAS FIND Standard Oil Co said the Friendswood Development Number One well in the Fostoria or Deep Wilcox Field of Montgomery County, Texas, flowed 4,500,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day from depths of 14,252 to 14,486 feet through a 14/64 inch choke. It said it has contracted for Perry Gas Cos Inc to purchase natural gas from the well, and Perry will build a four-inch gathering pipeline to connect to Natural Gas Pipeline Co's transmission line.

Endevco said it plans to extend its existing Mississippi Fuel Co System in southern Mississippi 18 miles to the new pipeline.  
label 22	FERC ISSUES TAKE-OR-PAY GAS POLICY PLAN The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the recovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas contracts between producers and pipelines. It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by Commissioner Charles Stalon. FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policy statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates." FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelines assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the remaining costs through their demand rates." It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming existing contracts to help spread the impact of these take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way. Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said "this proposal represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the industry through this difficult period of transition to a more competitive market." Hesse said "it is my hope that our proposed policy will encourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay contractual disputes that have impeded the industry's transition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital to the industry that we get this problem behind us."  
label 22	U.N. ISSUES REPORT ON NATURAL GAS CLAUSES The U.N. Centre on Transnational Corporations has issued a report containing guidelines and recommendations for negotiating natural gas clauses in agreements between transnational petroleum corporations and host countries. The U.N. said the report was aimed at promoting petroleum exploration in areas perceived as being gas prone. The 49-page report contains an in-depth examination of the problems of gas developoment and looks at different ways in which contractual terms might deal with the risks in gas development associated with pricing, marketing and volume.

It said the discovery well there encountered 46 feet of net natural gas pay. No flow tests have been conducted, it said. Diamond Shamrock Offshore said it has a 46.15 pct interest in the block, Phillips Petroleum Co 28.85 pct and Santa Fe Energy Partners LP &lt;SFP> 25.00 pct. Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> owns 80.3 pct of Diamond Shamrock Offshore.  
label 22	MITCHELL ENERGY &lt;MND> AGAIN CUTS CAPITAL OUTLAYS Mitchell Energy and Development Corp said it plans to hold its capital spending in fiscal 1988, ending January 31, to 96 mln dlrs, down from the 123 mln dlrs spent in 1987 and 213 mln dlrs in 1986. The company also said its natural gas revenues so far this year have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases due to mild weather and soft economic conditions. "But the contracts call for the lower 'takes' to be made up during the course of the year," Mitchell Energy said. Meanwhile it will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market. Mitchell Energy said the additional spot sales will tend to lower the average price realized for gas in the early part of fiscal 1988. However, it said the average for the full year is not expected to be significantly lower than the 2.99 dlrs per thousand cubic feet averaged in fiscal 1987.

label 23	TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT RECORD HIGH Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, bouyed by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank officials said Tuesday. Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on October 5. He declined to elaborate. A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at the end of the year. "The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank market," Chang said. Taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a year earlier, official figures show. Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year. About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade with the United States. Chien said Taiwan's trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs this year compared with 63.96 billion last year. Its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30 billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17 billion last year.

label 23	JAPAN FEBRUARY RESERVES RECORD 51.73 BILLION DLRS Japan's external reserves rose to a record 51.73 billion dlrs at the end of February from the previous record of 51.46 billion at end-January, the Finance Ministry said. End-February reserves last year were 27.58 billion dlrs. In January, the nation's foreign reserves showed the largest-ever monthly increase at 9.22 billion dlrs due to massive Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention during the month as the dollar fell briefly to an all-time low of 149.98 yen on January 19, foreign exchange dealers said.  
label 23	TAIWAN POWER FIRM PLANS MORE FOREIGN DEBT CUTS State-owned (Taiwan Power co) will boost its domestic borrowings to further cut its foreign debt in line with a government policy to trim the island's huge foreign exchange reserves, a company official said. The company's foreign debt, mainly from the Japanese and U.S. Banks, was cut nearly by half to 66.2 billion taiwan dlrs equivalent in calendar 1986 from 124.6 billion in 1985, he said. Its domestic borrowings however rose to 105.2 billion taiwan dlrs from 80.6 billion in the same period, he added. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now stood at 50 billion U.S. Dlrs, due to its 1986 record trade surplus of 15.6 billion.  
label 23	SWISS SIGHT DEPOSITS RISE 3.10 BILLION FRANCS Sight deposits by commercial banks at the Swiss National Bank rose by 3.10 billion Swiss francs to 10.53 billion in the last 10 days of February, the National Bank said. Foreign exchange reserves fell 3.06 billion francs to 30.64 billion. Sight deposits are an important measure of Swiss money market liquidity. The decline in foreign exchange reserves reflected the dismantling of swap arrangements, the National Bank said. Banknotes in circulation rose by 834 mln francs to 24.79 billion while other deposits on call - mainly government funds - fell 1.60 billion francs to 1.04 billion.  
label 23	BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES Thailand's improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached. Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.  
label 23	U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY Britain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said. The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels. He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.  
label 23	DANISH RESERVES RISE IN FEBRUARY Denmark's net official reserves rose to 36.34 billion crowns in February from 28.00 billion in January, against a revised 45.85 billion in February 1986, the central bank said in its monthly balance sheet report. Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial and major savings banks, rose to 38.26 billion crowns from 30.11 billion in January compared with a revised 35.99 billion in February last year. The bank said provisional figures showed net registered private and public capital imports of 10.3 billion crowns in February.
