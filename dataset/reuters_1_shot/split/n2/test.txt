label 8	JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES TO RECORD 3.2 PCT IN MAY Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 3.2 pct in May, the worst level since the government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said. The May rate surpassed the previous record of 3.0 pct marked set in January and April this year. It was also up sharply from 2.7 pct a year earlier. Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 1.91 mln people, up from 1.90 mln in April and 1.62 mln a year earlier. An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the strong yen for the rise in unemployment. The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set in July 1986. This compares with 2.9 pct in April and 2.7 pct a year earlie. Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 1.12 mln, up 180,000 from a year earlier. The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from April at a record 3.1 pct. A year ago, the rate was 2.8 pct. Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100,000 to 790,000. The yen's appreciation continued to affect employment in manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell 210,000 or 1.5 pct from a year earlier to 14.10 mln.  
label 8	JAPAN UNEMPLOYMNENT RISES TO RECORD IN JANUARY Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency said. Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier. Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people, up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier. Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-worst level set last December. Record male unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986. Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal to the record level marked in April, August, September and December last year. January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar, officials said. Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders, down 170,000.  
label 8	JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. "The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used," one economist said. More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's Tsukihara said.  
label 8	FINNISH UNEMPLOYMENT AT 6.7 PCT IN DECEMBER Finnish unemployment was 6.7 pct in December last year compared with 6.8 pct in November and 6.1 pct in December 1985, the Central Statistical Office said. It said 173,000 people were unemployed in December 1986, 174,000 in November and 157,000 in December 1985.

label 8	BELGIAN UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY Belgian unemployment, based on the number of jobless drawing unemployment benefit, fell to 12.1 pct of the working population at the end of February from 12.6 pct at the end of January, the National Statistics Office said. The rate compares with 12.4 pct at the end of February 1986. The total number of jobless stood at 508,392, compared with 530,587 at the end of January and 521,219 at the end of February 1986, the Statistics Office said.  
label 8	U.S. FIRST TIME JOBLESS CLAIMS FALL IN WEEK New applications for unemployment insurance benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,900 in the week ended Feb 21 from 368,400 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. The number of people actually receiving benefits under regular state programs totaled 3,014,400 in the week ended Feb 14, the latest period for which that figure was available. That was up from 2,997,800 the previous week.  
label 8	FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AID TO JOBLESS The government plans to go ahead with a three billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed, with the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to everyone becoming redundant, government officials said. At present only about one-third of the country's 2.6 mln jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive unemployment benefit. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television interviewer, "As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the right to social benefits." The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5 billion franc government fund set up last month to finance spending on special areas of concern. Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers hit by European Community cost-cutting measures. French unemployment has risen by more than 40 pct from 1.8 mln when socialist President Francois Mitterrand took office in 1981.  
label 8	JAPAN'S JOBLESS SEEN RISING TO 3.3 PCT IN 1987/88 The yen's rise against the dollar is expected to boost Japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3 pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from January's record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said. The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct. The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year. Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment. Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical machinery sectors, Nomura said. Employment in the non-manufacturing sector will continue to increase, the institute said, without giving figures.  
label 9	THAILAND TO RENEW LONG TERM SUGAR CONTRACTS -TRADE Thailand is to negotiate tomorrow with selected trade houses for renewal of long term raw sugar sales contracts, to cover the next five years at a rate of 60,000 tonnes annually, traders said. They also reported vague talk Algeria may be seeking 50,000 tonnes of raws tomorrow but details are unclear.  
label 9	WEST GERMAN BEET PLANTINGS DELAYED THREE WEEKS Unseasonal cold weather has delayed sugar beet plantings in West Germany by up to three weeks, the agriculture ministry said. A ministry spokesman said in some central areas, especially in the Rhineland, farmers have taken advantage of warmer weather and started plantings in the past two days. West German planting intentions this year are put at 381,000 hectares, down from 390,500 ha last year, he said, adding that the 1980/1985 average was 405,000 ha.  
label 9	U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a spokesman for Porter said. The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress last month. That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12 cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments, to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs. Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.  
label 9	SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM A sugar mill which was this nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic. The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said. "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar. "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said. He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy. "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people. Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead, and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.  
label 9	NORTH YEMEN BOUGHT WHITE SUGAR AT TENDER - TRADE North Yemen at its weekend tender bought white sugar from a French operator acting on behalf of a Swiss house at 214.70 dlrs a tonne c and f, traders said. The amount bought was not immediately available, although the country had sought 30,000 tonnes of June arrival whites, they said.  
label 9	PAKISTAN REPORTEDLY BOUGHT WHITE SUGAR AT TENDER Pakistan is reported to have bought 100,000 tonnes of white sugar at its weekend tender from a North Korean operator, traders said. The purchase, believed priced around 210 dlrs a tonne cost and freight for fine/medium grain, was due to be shipped for arrival in May (30,000 tonnes), in June (45,000) and in July (25,000 tonnes), they said.  
label 9	HAITIAN CANE PLANTERS PROTEST SUGAR MILL CLOSURE About 2,000 sugar cane planters marched to Port-au-Prince to protest against the closure of Haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer. The Haitian American Sugar Company closed on Friday because of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said Haiti has been flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the Dominican Republic and refined U.S. Sugar from Miami. The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000 small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.  
label 9	CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS China will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks, despite falling production and rising domestic demand, traders and the official press said. "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping. "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane is a major problem." A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian, south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted. He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet. The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said. Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports. "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat said. The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels," he said. Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba, China's major supplier through barter trade, he said. "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyer now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market." A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding imports was price. "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist," he said. The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but "a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the foreign exchange situation demands it."  
label 9	FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said. Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year. The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes. For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup. Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23. Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said. The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October. Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said. However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said. Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing." Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request. Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis." In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas. He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest. Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.  
label 9	FOUR SUGAR CARGOES SOLD TO CHINA YESTERDAY -TRADE Four cargoes of raw sugar were sold to China yesterday via the London trade to supplement the country's current nearby buying programme, traders said. The sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne c and f for July/August shipment or arrival in September, they said. Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total as much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was involved. China was still believed to be in the market for more sugar, traders said.

The rise took the year-on-year inflation rate to 3.4 pct in May from 3.5 pct in April, and brought cumulative inflation over the first five months of this year to 2.0 pct compared with 0.7 pct for the same period of 1986.  
label 10	EC ANNUAL INFLATION FALLS IN MAY The European Community's annual inflation rate fell marginally to 3.2 pct in May from 3.3 pct in April, the EC's statistics office Eurostat said. Prices in the 12-nation bloc rose 0.2 pct in May after 0.6 pct in April. But the annual rate stayed below that of the U.S. For the second month in succession, following the release of figures showing U.S. Inflation of 3.8 pct in both April and May. However, Eurostat said the EC was still beaten by Japan, where prices were provisionally 0.1 pct lower in May than a year earlier.

AFRICAN CONSUMER INFLATION FALLS IN SEPTEMBER South African year-on-year consumer price inflation in September fell to 15.5 pct from 16.3 pct in August, Central Statistics Office figures show. The monthly rise in the all items index (base 1980) was 1.3 pct to 273.4 in September after edging up to 270.0 in August. A year ago the index stood at 236.7 and year-on-year consumer price inflation at 19.7 pct.  
label 10	FED'S JOHNSON SEES EASING OF INFLATIONARY FEARS Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman Manuel Johnson said the inflationary expectations in the financial markets have eased since the Fed's last half-point increase in its discount rate to 6.0 pct. "We have seen the kind of expectational forces develop I think that we've been satisfied with since our last discount rate move," Johnson said. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the most recent discount rate increase on September 4 was largely aimed at quelling inflationary fears in financial markets which he said were largely unfounded.  
label 10	PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10 pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said. The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week. The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP). The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4 pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita said. Both were proposed last month. Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct by the National Economic and Development Authority early this month. In the first three months of the year, inflation was a negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5 and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics Office said. The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September respectively, the National Statistics Office said. It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water prices. The government's six and eight peso wage increases would displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.  
label 10	JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES FALL 0.4 PCT IN JANUARY Japan's unadjusted consumer price index (base 1985) fell 0.4 pct to 99.7 in January from the previous month, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said. The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December. The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1 pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct in September 1958. Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall decline for the month. Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities, gasoline and vegetables fell. The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down 0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs.  
label 10	ITALY CONSUMER PRICES RISE 0.4 PCT IN FEBRUARY Italy's consumer price index rose 0.4 pct in February compared with January after rising 0.6 pct in January over December, the national statistics institute (Istat) said. The year-on-year rise in February was 4.2 pct down from 4.5 pct in January and compared with 7.6 pct in February 1986. Istat said its consumer prices index for the families of workers and employees (base 1985) was 109.1 in February against 108.7 in January and 104.7 in February 1986.

Inflation as measured by the index rose to 17.5 pct over the 12 months to the end of February, compared with 16.6 pct last month and 24.5 pct to the end of February, 1986. In the first two months of the year, inflation was 3.8 pct, against 3.6 pct in the same period of 1986.  
label 11	GROUP OF 10 WELCOMES LATEST G-7 AGREEMENT The Group of 10 developed nations issued a communique welcoming the reaffirmation of the Paris accord on currency stability by the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies yesterday. In the communique issued this morning, the G-10 said "prospects of member countries' economies would be improved by stability in the exchange rates of their currencies." The G-10 includes the group of seven - the United States, Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy, West Germany and France - plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and also Switzerland. Sources who attended the G-10 conference this morning said the reference to the latest G-7 agreement was especially added to the brief communique because currency stability will benefit all the G-10 members. The G-10 met briefly before the International Monetary Fund Interim Committee meeting scheduled for today. .  
label 11	LAWSON SEES NO CHANGE IN U.K. MONETARY POLICY British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he saw no immediate implications for British monetary policy arising from the Group of Seven meeting yesterday. "Exchange rate stability is in the U.K.'s interest," he told journalists. Asked what it meant for U.K. monetary policy, he said, "No, I do not think there are any immediate implications."  
label 11	U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels. In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals." Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels." As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances "simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers. He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill. "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he said. Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall. "We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary," he said.  
label 11	FRANCE'S BALLADUR SAYS TARGET ZONE NOTION NEARER French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that the financial community is closer to arriving at a system of target zones for currencies despite the fact that little is being said about them. Speaking with reporters at the semiannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund, Balladur said, "We are not very far from the notion of target zones, even if we don't say so." He told reporters that "our ideas are progressing," adding that the finance ministers have been talking about more cooperation on economic policies and on levels around which currencies should stabilize.

In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts." He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies. Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today." The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public. "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures," he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving beyond rhetoric to action." He said they provide "more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination." He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. "This should be matter of priority for the executive board," he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options." He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables," he said.  
label 11	U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 400 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 400 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.085 billion stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note circulation will add some 340 mln stg, exchequer transactions around 300 mln and bankers' balances above target about 50 mln.  
label 11	KENYA DEVALUES SHILLING BY 0.6 PCT AGAINST SDR Kenya devalued the shilling by 0.6 pct against the special drawing right (SDR) in response to the decline of the dollar last last week, bankers said. The Central Bank of Kenya set the shilling at 20.7449 to the SDR compared with the 20.6226 rate in force since the last devaluation on March 31. The Kenyan shilling has lost 5.6 pct of its value against the SDR this year in a series of devaluations designed to keep the value of the dollar above 16 shillings.  
label 11	BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen in deficit financing bills today through 51-day repurchase agreements maturing June 3 to help absorb a projected money market surplus, money traders said. The operation will raise the outstanding supply of the bills to a record 4,800 billion yen. The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with the two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct. The traders estimated the surplus today at about 1,800 billion yen. They said it is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments and public entities and to excessive banking system cash holdings due to continuous large central bank dollar purchases.  
label 11	U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 75 MLN STG ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 75 mln stg help in the morning session. This compares with the Bank's estimate that the system would face a shortage of around 400 mln stg today. The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising two mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct, 15 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct and 58 mln stg in band three at 9-11/16 pct.

label 12	LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability. Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene "as and when necessary." He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament. "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk," he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States." Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit. "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year," Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness." Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant." He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that "current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been "carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing," he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

label 12	JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE Bank of Japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate. They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said.

label 13	ICCO BUFFER TO BUY 3,000 TONNES COCOA JUNE 3 The buffer stock manager of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about 3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in a statement. It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the previous announcement. These conditions are that offers from registered companies should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules, and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and spot to December arrival/delivery. The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account. The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins. The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights" to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00 pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said. No more than four offers will be considered from each offering party, it added.

They said Japan would participate in an ICCO meeting on July 13 in London to revise ICCO buffer stock policy. The 1986 ICCA has been in effect since January 1987. Government approval to participate in the ICCO was delayed by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue, the officials said.  
label 13	ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS Asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior. "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future." Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes. They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids. Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe. A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans. "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to talk down prices," the spokesman said. He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces. PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain. The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics" and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports. Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest cocoa growing area. Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic. Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques. One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates.  
label 13	BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.

label 13	PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. "The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December," one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.  
label 13	IVORY COAST CONFIRMS PRESENCE AT COCOA TALKS A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week. The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on Monday. While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will be present throughout the London talks, the official said. Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices Friday. The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world's cocoa exporters and consumers. He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March 27. The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses. Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.  
label 14	RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials told Reuters. Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation. "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said. However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas. Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries. The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials. Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence. Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour. "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said. "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it," one official said. "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned," he added. Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against. "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, " he said. "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader said. "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September," the official said.

An IBC spokesman told Reuters that a 15 mln dlr loan from the Banco do Brasil would be used to pay five mln dlrs a month in June, July and August to creditors. He said an auction of coffee would raise additional money and added that a Reuter report on June 16 gave the wrong impression that the auction was necessary to raise part of the 15 mln dlrs. No date has yet been set for the auction.  
label 14	EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said. Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said. "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone." Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota. "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, " van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude. "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement," van Horick added.  
label 14	COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S. A U.S. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers. Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas. "There is one country which evidently still does not," Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas. Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict. He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials. While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe, Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said. The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan. Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders. Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement. The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits.

label 14	BRAZIL COULD EXPORT 19 MLN BAGS OF COFFEE -IBC Brazil's coffee exports could amount to 19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate of 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said. He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags. He said the average limit of errors for the official crop harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first estimates officially published today. He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the guarantee minimum price.  
label 14	DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS Consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas, Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said. "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult." The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February. Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries. "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours."  
label 14	U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources. "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one analyst said. On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said. "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a U.S. Customs spokesman said. "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination)," he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system. "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster. "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers' hands." Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled. According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans. "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term. "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a threat," one trader said.  
label 14	IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS The Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said. He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction. Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion. The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said. He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate. Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form. Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from Monday. A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels, the spokesman added. A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.  
label 14	ICO EXECUTIVE BOARD TO MEET EARLY NOVEMBER The International Coffee Organization (ICO) Executive Board is to hold a meeting on November 3/4, its first since export quotas were re-introduced early this month. An ICO spokesman said the session, for the first time under the chairmanship of Bruno Caron of France, will review the market situation and the operation of quotas. On November 5 the six exporters making up the ICO Board of Management of the Promotion Fund will review its program for the 1987/88 year (Oct/Sept) and items left over from 1986/87. On November 2 a six nation working group will consider stock verification in Papua New Guinea.  
label 15	KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas said. In an article headlined "Gulf oil sources say Middle East production up 1.4 mln bpd" and "Markets witness new surplus amid whispers of return to cheating days," it warned OPEC's official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies. It did not say whether only OPEC or Opec and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from Monday, with activity in the European and American markets," it said. The sources were quoted as saying that after Opec had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details. "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew," it reported. "The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies. "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure Opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March," it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts. "More than one official has warned Opec would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May," it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.  
label 15	DOE RESOLVES ISSUES WITH ROYAL DUTCH &lt;RD> UNIT The Energy Department said it had approved in final form an agreement that resolves all remaining issues with Shell Oil Co over oil pricing and allocation controls that ended in 1981. Under the agreement, The Royal Dutch/Shell Group unit agreed to pay 20 mln dlrs to settle refiner pricing issues and 160 mln dlrs to settle crude oil pricing issues, DOE said. DOE said that before making the pact final, it modified it to reflect Shell's compliance with the Tertiary Incentive Program, a provision not in the version published last Dec 31.  
label 15	ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords. Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. "The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said. "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market," he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment." He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.

The company said its agreement with operator Conoco Hurghada Inc and Hispanoil covered the 168,374-acre East Hurghada offshore concession. It said a 15.6 mln U.S. dlr four-well program was planned for 1987. After the acquisition, which is subject to Egyptian government approval, working interests in the Hurghada block will be Conoco Hurghada at 45 pct, Hispanoil 30 pct and Gulf Canada the balance.  
label 15	TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but opinions are divided on the impact to the market. "The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," said one trader. "Everyone is talking about it, assessing their company's situations in relation to Texaco," he added. Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing. However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry," one New York trader said. "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything," he added. Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co. However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry," one New York trader said.

Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co. "There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great change," said another trader, adding that traders are tending toward prudence in their dealings with the company. Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco on an open line basis, he said. Another trader, however, described today's activity as business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in bankruptcy. Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins for Texaco's trades. New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for companies that are in financial trouble.  
label 15	ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said. CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.  
label 15	SAUDI ARABIA WANTS TO INCREASE OIL SALES TO JAPAN Saudi Arabia hopes to increase the volume of its oil exports to Japan through expanding bilateral trade, Saudi Arabian Interior Minister Naif bin Abdul-Aziz said. He told a Tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude and products exports to Japan to earlier levels, but did not elaborate. To promote trade, Saudi Arabia is inviting Japanese industries to do business there, he said. Japanese firms now have long-term contracts to import a total of 150,000 barrels per day of Saudi crude.  
label 15	ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS Ecuador will use a new pipeline link with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years, Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said. The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline, Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said. The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September. "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said. Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year. The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco. Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant compared with what we are going to earn." OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln dlrs per month, Espinosa said.  
label 15	PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen. Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago," he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output. "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions," Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said. "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained," he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer."  
label 15	SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry sources said. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition, said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged. The agreement signed in January for the months from February to June is up for renegotiation. Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp &lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them. But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement. John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur . "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul," he said. Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price. Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco. Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is now owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.
