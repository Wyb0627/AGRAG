alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. one of the factors that promotes neurodegeneration is the accumulation of senile plaques formed by a beta peptide. in this paper, it was analyzed that if oxidative stress is cause or consequence of amyloid cascade and the role of antioxidant defense system in this process, using s. cerevisiae (with a multicopy plasmid containing the a beta 1-42 sequence) as experimental model. cells grown on glycerol were more tolerant than when grown on glucose, strengthening the role of the antioxidant defense system against a beta accumulation. antioxidant defense deficiency did not change the pattern of amyloid aggregation. on the other hand, the presence of a beta increased the level of intracellular oxidation and induced the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and aconitase. peroxissomal catalase deficient cells (delta cta1), were more sensitive to a beta toxicity than the wild type strain, while mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (sod2) deficient cells displayed the highest frequency of petites. besides, a beta alters the oxygen consumption and the activity of complex iii and iv. taken together, our results point out that the a beta toxicity mechanism involves an oxidative stress induction by increasing ros production into the mitochondria, where cta1 and sod2 play a crucial role in the regulation of the redox balance.

alzheimer's_disease	the brain 's neocortex is anatomically organized into grey and white matter, which are mainly composed by neuronal and glial cells, respectively. the neocortex can be further divided in different brodmann areas according to their cytoarchitectural organization, which are associated with distinct cortical functions. there is increasing evidence that brain development and function are governed by epigenetic processes, yet their contribution to the functional organization of the neocortex remains incompletely understood. herein, we determined the dna methylation patterns of grey and white matter of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (brodmann area 9), an important region for higher cognitive skills that is particularly affected in various neurological diseases. for avoiding interindividual differences, we analyzed white and grey matter from the same donor using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and for validating their biological significance, we used infinium humanmethylation450 beadchip and pyrosequencing in ten and twenty independent samples, respectively. the combination of these analysis indicated robust grey-white matter differences in dna methylation. what is more, cell type-specific markers were enriched among the most differentially methylated genes. interestingly, we also found an outstanding number of grey-white matter differentially methylated genes that have previously been associated with alzheimer 's, parkinson 's, and huntington 's disease, as well as multiple and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. the data presented here thus constitute an important resource for future studies not only to gain insight into brain regional as well as grey and white matter differences, but also to unmask epigenetic alterations that might underlie neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease is a representative age-related neurodegenerative disease that could result in loss of memory and cognitive deficiency. however, the precise onset time of alzheimer 's disease affecting neuronal circuits and the mechanisms underlying the changes are not clearly known. to address the neuroanatomical changes during the early pathologic developing process, we acquired the neuronal morphological characterization of ad in app/ps1 double-transgenic mice using the micro-optical sectioning tomography system. we reconstructed the neurons in 3d datasets with a resolution of 0.32 x 032 x 1 gm and used the sholl method to analyze the anatomical characterization of the dendritic branches. the results showed that, similar to the progressive change in amyloid plaques, the number of dendritic branches were significantly decreased in 9-month-old mice. in addition, a distinct reduction of dendritic complexity occurred in third and fourth-order dendritic branches of 9-month-old mice, while no significant changes were identified in these parameters in 6-month-old mice. at the branch-level, the density distribution of dendritic arbors in the radial direction decreased in the range of 40-90 gm from the neuron soma in 6-month-old mice. these changes in the dendritic complexity suggest that these reductions contribute to the progressive cognitive impairment seen in app/ps1 mice. this work may yield insights into the early changes in dendritic abnormality and its relevance to dysfunctional mechanisms of learning, memory and emotion in alzheimer 's disease.

alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease is a multifactorial and fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by decline of cholinergic function, deregulation of other neurotransmitter systems, beta-amyloid fibril deposition, and beta-amyloid oligomers formation. based on the involvement of a relevant number of biological systems in alzheimer 's disease progression, multitarget compounds may enable therapeutic efficacy. accordingly, compounds possessing, besides anticholinergic activity and beta-amyloid aggregation inhibition properties, metal chelating and/or nitric oxide releasing properties with additional antioxidant capacity were developed. other targets relevant to alzheimer 's disease have also been considered in the last years for producing multitarget compounds such as beta-secretase, monoamino oxidases, serotonin receptors and sigma 1 receptors. the purpose of this review will be to highlight recent reports on the development of multitarget compounds for alzheimer 's disease published within the last years focusing on multifunctional ligands characterized by tacrine-like and donepezil-like structures.

parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is an insidious onset neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 1% of the population over the age of 65. so far available therapies for pd have only aimed at improving or alleviating symptoms, but not at slowing, preventing, and reversing the course of pd. recently, some studies have indicated that the levels and activation of abelson non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-abl, abl1) were up-regulated in the brain tissue of patients with pd and demonstrated that c-abl inhibitors could improve motor behavior, prevent the loss of dopamine neurons, inhibit phosphorylation of cdk5, regulate alpha-synuclein phosphorylation and clearance, inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of parkin and decrease parkin substrate, for example, paris (zinc finger protein 746), aimp2 (aminoacyl-trna synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein type2), fbp1 (fuse-binding protein 1), and synphilin-1. therefore, we review the mechanism of the c-abl inhibitor in pd and conclude that c-abl inhibitors may be a potential treatment in pd and other neurodegenerative disease.
parkinson's_disease	neural synchrony in the basal ganglia, especially in the beta frequency band (13-30 hz), is a hallmark of parkinson 's disease and considered as antikinetic. in contrast, the healthy basal ganglia show low levels of synchrony. it is currently unknown where synchrony and oscillations arise in the parkinsonian brain and how they are transmitted through the basal ganglia, as well as what makes them dependent on dopamine. the external part of the globus pallidus has recently been identified as a hub nucleus in the basal ganglia, possessing intrinsic inhibitory connections and possibly also gap junctions. in this study, we show that in a conductance-based network model of the basal ganglia, the combination of sparse, high-conductance inhibitory synapses and sparse, low-conductance gap junctions in the external part of the globus pallidus could effectively desynchronize the whole network. however, when gap junction coupling became strong enough, the effect was impeded and activity synchronized. in particular, sustained periods of beta coherence occurred between some neuron pairs. as gap junctions can change their conductance with the dopamine level, we suggest pallidal gap junction coupling as a mechanism contributing to the development of beta synchrony in the parkinsonian basal ganglia.
parkinson's_disease	background: the proteasome catalyzes the degradation of many mis-folded proteins, which are otherwise cytotoxic. there is interest in the discovery of proteasome agonists, but previous efforts to do so have been disappointing. methods: the cleavage of small fluorogenic peptides is used routinely as an assay to screen for proteasome modulators. we have developed follow-on assays that employ more physiologically relevant substrates. results: to demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow, the nih clinical collection (ncc) was screened. while many compounds stimulated proteasome-mediated proteolysis of the pro-fluorogenic peptide substrates, most failed to evince activity in assays with larger peptide or protein substrates. we also show that two molecules claimed previously to be proteasome agonists, oleuropein and betulinic acid, indeed accelerate hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate, but have no effect on the turnover of a mis-folded protein in vitro or in cellulo. however, two small molecules from the ncc, mk-866 and am-404, stimulate the proteasome-mediated turnover of a mis-folded protein in living cells by 3- to 4-fold. conclusion: assays that monitor the proteasome-mediated degradation of larger peptides and proteinscan distinguish bona fide agonists from compounds only able to stimulate the cleavage of short, non-physiologically relevant peptides. general significance: a suite of assays has been established that allows the discovery of bona fide proteasome agonists. am-404 and mk-866 can be useful tools for cell culture experiments, and can serve as scaffolds to generate more potent 20s stimulators.

parkinson's_disease	background: parkinson 's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in the widespread loss of select classes of neurons throughout the nervous system. the pathological hallmarks of parkinson 's disease are lewy bodies and neurites, of which alpha-synuclein fibrils are the major component. alpha-synuclein aggregation has been reported in the gut of parkinson 's disease patients, even up to a decade before motor symptoms, and similar observations have been made in animal models of disease. however, unlike the central nervous system, the nature of alpha-synuclein species that form these aggregates and the classes of neurons affected in the gut are unclear. we have previously reported selective expression of alpha-synuclein in cholinergic neurons in the gut (j comp neurol. 2013; 521: 657), suggesting they may be particularly vulnerable to degeneration in parkinson 's disease. methods: in this study, we used immunohistochemistry to detect alpha-synuclein oligomers and fibrils via conformation-specific antibodies after rotenone treatment or prolonged exposure to high [k+] in ex vivo segments of guinea-pig ileum maintained in organotypic culture. key results: rotenone and prolonged raising of [ k+] caused accumulation of - alpha-synuclein fibrils in the axons of cholinergic enteric neurons. this took place in a time- and, in the case of rotenone, concentration-dependent manner. rotenone also caused selective necrosis, indicated by increased cellular autofluorescence, of cholinergic enteric neurons, labeled by chat-immunoreactivity, also in a concentration-dependent manner. conclusions & inferences: to our knowledge, this is the first report of rotenone causing selective loss of a neurochemical class in the enteric nervous system. cholinergic enteric neurons may be particularly susceptible to lewy pathology and degeneration in parkinson 's disease.
parkinson's_disease	prion-like propagation of abnormal intracytoplasmic proteins, which are the defining features of major neurodegenerative disorders, such as alzheimer 's disease (ad), parkinson 's disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), has been proposed. a growing body of evidence strongly suggests that abnormal tau, alpha-synuclein and tdp-43 have prion-like properties, convert the corresponding normal proteins into abnormal forms, and are transmitted from cell to cell, spreading throughout the brain. this idea is extremely important not only for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, but also for the development of molecular therapies. since the distributions and spreading of the abnormal proteins are closely associated with disease symptoms and progression, gain-of-toxic-function of these proteins may affect the neurons and glial cells either directly or indirectly, or both. it is essential to regulate the aggregation of abnormal intracellular proteins and their cell-to-cell transmission in order to stop, or at least slow, the progression of these diseases.

sprains_and_strains	,background: the objective was to describe the patterns and mechanisms of water tubing related injuries treated in u.s. emergency departments. methods: the national electronic injury surveillance system was used to examine cases of water tubing related injuries. sample weights were used to calculate national estimates of water tubing related injuries. analyses were conducted in 2010. results: from 1991-2009 an estimated 69,471 injuries were treated in us emergency departments for water tubing related injuries. the annual number of cases increased 250% over the 19-year study period (p<.001). sprains and strains accounted for the largest portion of injuries (27.2%). the head was the most frequently injured body part (27.5%). children and adolescents= 20 years, were more likely than individuals 19 years to sustain sprains and strains (or: 2.11; 95% ci = 1.64-2.71) and were most commonly injured by impact with the water (54.6%). conclusions: patterns of water tubing related injuries differ for children and adults. research is needed to determine how best to reduce these injuries.
sprains_and_strains	objective-to determine the type and number of injuries that occur during the training and practice of muay thai kick boxing and to compare the data obtained with those from previous studies of karate and taekwondo. methods-one to one interviews using a standard questionnaire on injuries incurred during training and practice of muay thai kick boxing were conducted at various gyms and competitions in the united kingdom and a muay thai gala in holland. results-a total of 152 people were questioned, 132 men and 20 women. there were 19 beginners, 82 amateurs, and 51 professionals. injuries to the lower extremities were the most common in all groups. head injuries were the second most common in professionals and amateurs. trunk injuries were the next most common in beginners. the difference in injury distribution among the three groups was significant (p less than or equal to0.01). soft tissue trauma was the most common type of injury in the three groups. fractures were the second most common in professionals, and in amateurs and beginners it was sprains and strains (p less than or equal to0.05). annual injury rates were: beginners, 13.5/1000 participants; amateurs, 2.43/1000 participants; professionals, 2.79/1000 participants. for beginners, 7% of injuries resulted in seven or more days off training; for amateurs and professionals, these values were 4% and 5.8% respectively. conclusions-the results are similar to those found for karate and taekwondo with regard to injury distribution, type, and rate. the percentage of injuries resulting in time off training is less.
sprains_and_strains	objective: to characterize the risk of injury associated with 10 popular high school sports by comparing the relative frequency of injury and selected injury rates among sports, as well as the participation conditions within each sport. design and setting: a cohort observational study of high school athletes using a surveillance protocol whereby certified athletic trainers recorded data during the 1995-1997 academic years. subjects: players listed on the school 's varsity team rosters for football, wrestling, baseball, field hockey, softball, girls' volleyball, boys' or girls' basketball, and boys' or girls' soccer. measurements: injuries and opportunities for injury (exposures) were recorded daily. the definition of reportable injury used in the study required that certified athletic trainers evaluate the injured players and subsequently restrict them from participation. results: football had the highest injury rate per 1000 athlete-exposures at 8.1, and volleyball had the lowest rate at 1.7. only boys' (59.3%) and girls' (57.0%) soccer showed a larger proportion of reported injuries for games than practices, while volleyball was the only sport to demonstrate a higher injury rate per 1000 athlete-exposures for practices than for games. more than 73% of the injuries restricted players for fewer than 8 days. the proportion of knee injuries was highest for girls' soccer (19.4%) and lowest for baseball (10.5%). among the studied sports, sprains and strains accounted for more than 50% of the injuries, except in field hockey (45.7%). of the injuries requiring surgery, 60.3% were to the knee. conclusions: an inherent risk of injury is associated with participation in high school sports based on the nature of the game and the activities of the players. therefore, injury prevention programs should be in place for both practices and games. preventing reinjury through daily injury management is a critical component of an injury prevention program. although sports injuries cannot be entirely eliminated, consistent and professional evaluation of yearly injury patterns can provide focus for the development and evaluation of injury prevention strategies.
sprains_and_strains	myer, gd, quatman, ce, khoury, j, wall, ej, and hewett, te. youth versus adult ""weightlifting"" injuries presenting to united states emergency rooms: accidental versus nonaccidental injury mechanisms. j strength cond res 23(7): 2054-2060, 2009-resistance training has previously been purported to be unsafe and ineffective in children. the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate resistance training-related injuries presenting to u. s. emergency rooms by age, type, and mechanism of injury. we hypothesized that older athletes would sustain greater percentages of joint sprains and muscle strains, whereas younger athletes would sustain a greater percentage of accidental injuries that would result in an increased percentage of fractures in youths. the u. s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc) national electronic injury surveillance system was queried from 2002 to 2005 using the cpsc code for ""weightlifting."" subjects between the ages of 8 and 30 were grouped by age categories 8 to 13 (elementary/middle school age), 14 to 18 (high school), 19 to 22 (college), and 23 to 30 (adult). injuries were classified as ""accidental'' if caused by dropped weight or improper equipment use. multiple logistic regression was used to compare accidental injuries between age groups. the sample consisted of 4,111 patients. accidental injuries decreased (p14 to 18 >19 to 22 years = 23 to 30 years. conversely, sprain/strain injuries increased in each successive age group (p < 0.05). evaluation of only the nonaccidental injuries (n = 2,565) showed that the oldest categories (19-22 and 23-30 yr) demonstrated a greater percentage of sprains and strains relative to younger age categories (p < 0.001). two thirds of the injuries sustained in the 8 to 13 group were to the hand and foot and were most often related to ""dropping"" and ""pinching"" in the injury descriptions, and there was an increased percentage of fractures in the 8 to 13 group relative to all other groups (p < 0.001). the study findings indicate that children have lower risk of resistance training-related joint sprains and muscle strains than adults. the majority of youth resistance training injuries are the result of accidents that are potentially preventable with increased supervision and stricter safety guidelines.
sprains_and_strains	incidence and types of injuries were investigated among 180 nigerian soccer players selected from 6 clubs by a stratified random technique on the basis of somatotypes. the purpose was to identify physique types that are most prone to common injuries in soccer, in the groups during an 8-week duration of intensive training. a total of 552 injuries: sprains and strains (45%), bruises and cuts (30%), dislocations (15%), fractures (5%) and concussion (5%) were recorded sustained by players who participated in the 8-week period of vigorous daily training. the study found that 45% of the meso-ectomorphs (n = 65) and 44% of the mesomorphs (n = 50) sustained injuries while 85% of the ectomorphs (n = 25) and 50% of the ectomesomorphs (n = 40) were injured. the study concluded that soccer players whose somatotypes range between meso-ectomorphic to the mesomorphic builds are less prone to injuries than their more fragile linear counterparts. it recommended that soccer players should be preselected on the basis of somatotypes and in most cases, mesomorphic and meso-ectomorphic types should be finally considered. it proposed that match referees should endeavour to enforce the soccer rules and escbew prejudice to prevent frustration-aggression reactions which are good causes of injuries to players.
cancer	although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) have dramatically improved clinical outcome in chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), cure rarely occurs. this may be due to bcr-abl-independent, aberrant signaling pathways, one of which leads to leukotriene (lt) formation. well-recognized as inflammatory mediators, lt can also affect oncogenic mechanisms of several tumors. we have previously discovered elevated lt-synthesis and up-regulated cysteinyl-lt-inducing enzyme in cml. here we report on dose-dependent inhibition of cml cell growth exerted by specific blockers of lt-signaling. thus, the cysteinyl-lt1-receptor-antagonist montelukast significantly reduced the growth of k562, kcl22, and ku812 cells, as well as primary cd34(+)blood cells from two cml patients. adding montelukast to the tki imatinib caused combined inhibition. no effect was seen on normal bone marrow cells. similarly, growth inhibition was also observed with the 5-lipoxygenase (lo)-inhibitor bwa4c, the 5-lo-activating-protein-(flap)-inhibitor licofelone and the ltb4(blt1)-receptor-antagonist ly293111. thus, blocking of aberrant lt-signaling may provide an additional, novel therapeutic possibility in cml.
cancer	muff homolog 1 (mth1), a nudix phosphohydrolase enzyme participates in the process of repairing of dna damage by hydrolyzing oxidized deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate in cancer cells, is regarded as a potential target for anticancer therapy. in order to seek for promising inhibitor of mth1, structured based pharmacophore and 3d-qsar pharmacophore hypotheses combine with the admet analysis and lipinski 's rule of five were used for screening the public molecules libraries (asinex, ibscreen and natural). then molecular docking studies were performed on screened hits via various docking programs (glide sp, gold and glide xp), five molecules with three scaffolds were picked out as potential inhibitors against mth1. eventually, 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation was implemented on the potential inhibitors. the rmsd (root mean square deviation) values were used to illustrate bind stability between potential molecules and mth1. therefore, the five hits may be considered as promising mth1 inhibitors by all above studies.

cancer	this study aimed to evaluate the isoflavone and total phenolic contents in kefir-fermented soymilk storage and after the in vitro digestive system simulation (dss). soymilk was fermented with kefir culture (0.02 uc/l) at 25 degrees c for 15 h and stored at 4 degrees c for 4 days. after the fermentation and storage, the isoflavone and total phenolic contents were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry, respectively. the cell viability of lactic acid bacteria and yeast was evaluated. fermentation promoted an increase of approximately 3 log cfu/g cycles of the microorganisms and the storage process did not alter the aglycone isoflavones and total phenolic contents. the content of aglycone isoflavones increased 2-fold, and the total phenolic content increased 9-fold. therefore, kefir-fermented soymilk is a good source of aglycone isoflavones and phenolics, since the content of these substances was increased significantly after the in vitro digestive system simulation of the product.

cancer	the core components of the hippo signaling pathway are a cascade of kinases that govern the phosphorylation of downstream transcriptional co-activators, namely, yes-associated protein (yap) and ww domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (wwtr1, also known as taz). the hippo signaling pathway is considered an important tumor-suppressor pathway, and its dysregulation has been noted in a variety of human cancers, in which yap/wwtr1 enable cancerous cells to overcome contact inhibition, and to grow and spread uncontrollably. interestingly, however, recent studies have told a somewhat different but perhaps more intriguing yap/wwtr1 story, as these studies found that yap/wwtr1 function as a central hub that integrates signals from multiple upstream signaling pathways, cell cell interactions and mechanical forces and then bind to and activate different downstream transcriptional factors to direct cell social behavior and cell-cell interactions. in this review, we present the latest findings on the role of yap/wwtr1 in skin physiology, pathology and tumorigenesis and discuss the statuses of newly developed therapeutic interventions that target yap/wwtr1 in human cancers, as well as their prospects for use as skin cancer treatments.

cancer	acoustophoresis, the ability to acoustically manipulate particles and cells inside a microfluidic channel, is a critical enabling technology for cell-sorting applications. however, one of the major impediments for routine use of acoustophoresis at clinical laboratory has been the reliance on the inherent physical properties of cells for separation. here, we present a microfluidic-based microbubble-activated acoustic cell sorting (baacs) method that rely on the specific binding of target cells to microbubbles conjugated with specific antibodies on their surface for continuous cell separation using ultrasonic standing wave. in acoustophoresis, cells being positive acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure nodes. on the contrary, air-filled polymer-shelled microbubbles being strong negative acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure antinodes and can be used to selectively migrate target cells. as a proof of principle, we demonstrate the separation of cancer cell line in a suspension with better than 75% efficiency. moreover, 100% of the microbubble-cell conjugates migrated to the anti-node. hence a better upstream affinity-capture has the potential to provide higher sorting efficiency. the baacs technique expands the acoustic cell manipulation possibilities and offers cell-sorting solutions suited for applications at point of care.
sports_injuries	objectives: to determine the immediate pain relief effect of low-level laser therapy on sports injuries in athletes and degree of pain relief by the therapy. design: double-blind, randomized, comparative clinical study. methods: participants were 32 college athletes with motion pain at a defined site. participants were randomized into two groups in which the tested or placebo laser therapy was administered to determine pain intensity from painful action before and after laser irradiation, using the modified numerical rating scale. the post-therapeutic modified numerical rating scale score was subtracted from the pre-therapeutic modified numerical rating scale score to determine pain intensity difference, and the rate of pain intensity difference to pre-therapeutic modified numerical rating scale was calculated as pain relief rate. results: low-level laser therapy was effective in 75% of the laser group, whereas it was not effective in the placebo group, indicating a significant difference in favor of the laser group (p < 0.001). pain relief rate was significantly higher in the laser group than in the placebo group (36.94% vs. 8.20%, respectively, p <0.001), with the difference in pain relief rate being 28.74%. conclusions: low-level laser therapy provided an immediate pain relief effect, reducing pain by 28.74%. it was effective for pain relief in 75% of participants.

sports_injuries	background: excessive stiffness of lower limb muscles is associated with sports injuries. therefore, the identification of a reliable measurement of the shear elastic modulus of various ankle plantar flexion muscles is required to evaluate lower leg sports injuries. this study investigated the reliable measurement of the shear elastic modulus of the ankle plantar flexion muscles at different ankle positions. methods: twenty-three healthy young men (25.3 +/- 3.6 years, 172.9 +/- 5.0 cm, 67.2 +/- 7.2 kg) participated in this study. the shear elastic moduli of the ankle plantar flexion muscles including the lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, soleus, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum longus and tibialis posterior were measured using ultrasonic shear wave elastography at 0, 10 and 20 degrees dorsiflexion. results: the reliability of the shear elastic modulus measurements for each ankle position was assessed. the results showed that the interday reliability of the measurements differed between ankle positions and that the reliability of the shear elastic modulus measurements at 20 degrees dorsiflexion was higher than that at 10 degrees or 0 degrees. conclusion: our results suggest that measurements at 20 degrees dorsiflexion may provide a more reliable measurement of the shear elastic modulus of ankle plantar flexion muscles.
sports_injuries	background: sports injuries are often described as overuse or traumatic. little is known about the frequency of overuse injuries and, in particular, if they vary between different types of sporting activities. purpose: to identify any differences between sports in relation to diagnoses of overuse injuries of the extremities ( oie) and anatomical areas most likely to be injured in adults and to compare these findings with those reported in youngsters, as identified in a previous review. methods: a search was made in may 2015 and again in april 2016 in pubmed, sportdiscus, psycinfo, and web of sciences. search terms were "" overuse injuries or cumulative trauma disorders or musculoskeletal injuries "" and "" extremity or limb "" and "" physical activity or sport or risk factor or exercises "". inclusion criteria were: 1) prospective, or cross-sectional study design; 2) at least 1/3 of the population should be >= 19 years; 3) articles must clearly state if reported cases were classified as traumatic or overuse injuries in relation to a particular sports type, 4) sample size >50, and 5) articles must not deal with specific occupational subpopulations nor with clinical populations. a blinded systematic review was conducted and results reported per anatomical site of injury and diagnosis for the different sports. results: in all, 10 of 1435 identified articles were included, studying soccer, beach-volleyball and triathlon. in general, the incidence estimates were low, never above 2.0/1000 h of practice, similar to results seen in children/adolescents. the incidence estimates and the diagnoses of oie were given only in 4 articles on soccer, making comparisons between sports impossible. as in children/adolescents, the lower limb is more often affected than the upper but contrary to young people the injured site in adults is more often the knee and above, and there were also differences in the diagnoses for the two age groups. conclusion: the literature does not permit to identify clearly the difference in the incidence of oie for different sports showing that more but well-designed surveillance studies are needed.
sports_injuries	objectives: the majority of football injuries are caused by trauma to the lower extremities. shinguards are considered an important measure in preventing lower leg impact abrasions, contusions and fractures. given these benefits, federation internationale de football association introduced the shinguard law in 1990, which made wearing shinguards during matches mandatory. this study evaluated the effect of the introduction of the shinguard law for amateur players in the netherlands in the 1999/2000-football season on the incidence of lower leg injuries. design: time trend analyses on injury data covering 25 years of continuous registration (1986-2010). methods: data were retrieved from a system that records, all emergency department treatments in a random, representative sample of dutch hospitals. all injuries sustained in football by patients aged 6-65 years were included, except for injuries of the achilles tendon and weber fractures. time trends were analysed with multiple regression analyses; a model was fitted consisting of multiple straight lines, each representing a 5-year period. results: patients were predominantly males (92%) and treated for fractures (48%) or abrasions/contusions (52%) to the lower leg. the incidence of lower leg football injuries decreased significantly following the introduction of the shinguard law (1996-2000: -20%; 2001-2005: -25%), whereas the incidence of all other football injuries did not. this effect was more prominent at weekends/match days. no gender differences were found. conclusions: the results significantly show a preventive effect of the shinguard law underlining the relevance of rule changes as a preventive measure and wearing shinguards during both matches and training sessions.

sports_injuries	in the pediatric shoulder, injury and pathology can disrupt the muscle force balance, resulting in severe functional losses. as little data exists pertaining to in vivo pediatric shoulder muscle function, musculoskeletal data are crucially needed to advance the treatment of pediatric shoulder pathology/injury. therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a pediatric database of in vivo volumes for the major shoulder muscles and correlate these volumes with maximum isometric flexion/extension, internal/external rotation, and abduction/adduction joint moments. a methodology was developed to derive 3d shoulder muscle volumes and to divide the deltoid into sub-units with unique torque producing capabilities, based on segmentation of three-dimensional magnetic resonance images. eleven typically developing children/adolescents (4f/7m, 12.0 +/- 3.2 years, 150.8 +/- 16.7 cm, 49.2 +/- 16.4 kg) participated. correlation and regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between volume and maximum, voluntary, isometric joint torques. the deltoid demonstrated the largest (30.4 +/- 1.2%) and the supraspinatus the smallest (4.8 +/- 0.5%) percent of the total summed volume of all six muscles evaluated. the anterior and posterior deltoid sections were 43.4 +/- 3.9% and 56.6 +/- 3.9% of the total deltoid volume. the percent volumes were highly consistent across subjects. individual muscle volumes demonstrated moderate-high correlations with torque values (0.70-0.94, p<0.001). this study presents a comprehensive database documenting normative pediatric shoulder muscle volume. using these data a clear relationship between shoulder volume and the torques they produce was established in all three rotational degrees-of-freedom. this study furthers the understanding of shoulder muscle function and serves as a foundation for evaluating shoulder injury/pathology in the pediatric/adolescent population.

senior_health	background. the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes) in nursing home residents (nhrs) is increasing, concurrently with obesity and other comorbid conditions. nhr would benefit greatly from antidiabetic medications that would improve glycemic control and give a lower risk of hypoglycemia but that do not contribute to weight gain in obese individuals. objective. to examine the prescription patterns to nhrs with diabetes, including the use of newer injectable therapies such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) receptor agonists. methods. treatment patterns of diabetes in nhr were analyzed using minimum data set records and prescription claims from the omnicare senior health outcomes data repository (may 2011-september 2012). results. the prevalence of diabetes in this population of 229,283 nhrs was 35.4%. among the 44,665 nhrs with diabetes and prescription claims data, the prevalence of obesity (40.3%) and multiple comorbidities (100%) was high. approximately 20% of the nhrs with diabetes were aged80%), followed by oral agents (54%). glp-1 receptor agonist use was low (0.5%) and associated with poor treatment persistence. conclusion. considerations other than glycemic control may drive prescribing decisions, contrary to recommendations from the american diabetes association, american medical directors association, and european association for the study of diabetes.
senior_health	methods the study is based on semi-structured qualitative interviews with policy-makers and senior health care managers in two russian regions, and a review of published and unpublished sources on health systems and hiv in russia. findings we identified a number of factors associated with the system 's failure to address the epidemic. we argue that these factors are not unique to hiv/aids. the features of the wider health system within which the hiv response was set up influenced the structure and capacities of the programme, particularly its regulatory and clinical orientation; the discrepancy between formal commitments and implementation; the focus on screening services; and problems with scaling up interventions targeting high-risk groups. discussion the system-programme interplay is as important in middle-income countries as in poorer settings. an advanced health care infrastructure cannot protect health systems from potential failures in the delivery of vertical programmes. the hiv response cannot be effective, efficient and responsive to the needs of the population if the broader health system does not adhere to the same principles. strengthening hiv responses in post-soviet societies will require improvements in their wider health systems, namely advocacy of prevention for high-risk populations, reallocation of resources from curative towards preventive services, building decision-making capacities at the local level, and developing better working environments for health care staff.
senior_health	the senior consultant and senior health adviser in all genitourinary medicine clinics in the uk were sent a questionnaire on hiv testing practice in seven clinical scenarios. for each scenario the recommended time interval between possible exposure and final hiv antibody test varied from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of over 5 years. the results show 2 broad patterns: when the contact was not someone known to be hiv positive the commonest recommended time interval was 3 months; for a known exposure to hiv the commonest recommendation was 6 months. only 16 out of the 151 clinics replying had a written policy setting out the interval to elapse between possible exposure to hiv and the final test for hiv antibodies. variation of practice within clinics is less where written policies exist. some staff in clinics are recommending inappropriately long intervals before the final hiv test.
senior_health	objective: to examine the extent to which local health department (lhd) assurance of select services known to promote and protect the health of older adults is associated with more favorable population health indicators among seniors. design: data from the california health interview survey (chis: 2003, 2005, and 2007) were linked with the 2005 wave of the national association of county and city health officials profile survey and the area resource file to assess the association of lhd assurance and senior health indicators. assurance was measured by an index of 5 services, either directly provided or contracted by lhds: cancer screening, injury prevention, comprehensive primary care, home health care, and chronic disease prevention. multilevel regression models estimated the association of lhd assurance of services and each of 6 older adult health indicators, controlling for individual, lhd, and county characteristics that included key social determinants of health, such as poverty. setting: fifty-seven california counties. participants: 33,154 older adults (age 65 and older). main outcome measures: colorectal cancer screening, mammography, healthy eating, physical activity, and multiple falls among older adults. results: local health departments provided or contracted a median of 2 of the 5 services. in adjusted analyses, lhd assurance of services was generally unassociated with the seniors' health behaviors, screening, and falls. greater lhd expenditures per capita were associated with significantly better mammography screening rates (adjusted odds ratio [aor] = 1.22, p < 0.01) compared to jurisdictions in the bottom one-third of per capita lhd spending. greater county-level poverty (a social determinant of health) was associated with greater junk food consumption (aor = 1.14, p < 0.01) and worse fruit and vegetable consumption (aor = 0.97, p < 0.01). highly impoverished counties were consistently in the bottom quartile of performance across all indicators. conclusions: the lhd 's assurance of select services known to promote and protect the health of older adults does not appear to translate into higher rates of colorectal cancer screening, mammography, healthy eating, physical activity, and fewer falls among seniors. county-level poverty is most strongly associated with older adult health, underscoring a key barrier to address in local senior health improvement efforts.
senior_health	most approaches to the detection of presymptomatic or prodromal alzheimer 's disease require the costly collection and analysis of biological samples or neuroimaging measurements. the dementia risk assessment (dra) was developed to facilitate this detection by collecting self-report and proxy-report of dementia risk variables and episodic memory performance on a free internet website. we now report two validation studies. in study 1, 130 community-residing older adults seeking memory screening at senior health fairs were tested using the mini-cog, and were then observed while taking the dra. they were compared to a demographically-matched subsample from our anonymous internet sample. participants seeking memory screening had more dementia risk factors and obtained lower scores on the dra 's recognition memory test (rmt) than their internet controls. in addition, those who failed the mini-cog obtained much lower scores on the rmt than those who passed the mini-cog. in study 2, 160 older adults seeking evaluation of cognitive difficulties took the dra prior to diagnostic evaluations at outpatient dementia clinics. patients who ultimately received the diagnosis of a dementia syndrome scored significantly lower on the rmt than those diagnosed with other conditions or deemed normal. lower education, family history of dementia, presence of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, and memory test score distinguished the dementia and no-dementia groups with around 82% accuracy. in addition, score on the rmt correlated highly with scores on other instruments widely used to detect cognitive decline. these findings support the concurrent validity of the dra for detecting prevalent cognitive impairment. prospective studies of cognitively normal persons who subsequently develop dementia will be necessary to establish its predictive validity.
multiple_sclerosis	objective direct stimulation of the peroneal nerve by the actigait implantable drop foot stimulator is a potent therapy that was described previously for stroke-related drop foot. the authors report here successful long-term application of the actigait implantable drop foot stimulator in patients with multiple sclerosis (ms). methods six patients with ms and 2 years of persisting central leg paresis received an implantable actigait drop foot stimulator after successful surface test stimulation. ten weeks and 1 year after surgery, their gait speed, endurance, and safety were evaluated. patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. results in the 20-m gait test, stimulation with the actigait stimulator significantly reduced the time needed, on average, by approximately 23.6% 10 weeks after surgery, and the time improved further by 36.3% after 1 year. the median distance covered by patients with the stimulator after 6 minutes of walking increased significantly from 217 m to 321 m and remained stable for 1 year; the distance covered by patients after surface stimulation was 264 m. patients with an implanted actigait stimulator noticed pronounced improvement in their mobility, social participation, and quality of life. conclusions the actigait implantable drop foot stimulator improved gait speed, endurance, and quality of life in all patients over a period of 1 year. it may serve as a new therapeutic option for patients with ms-related drop foot.
multiple_sclerosis	backgrounda 30-item qualiveen questionnaire was developed to measure the impact of urinary problems on everyday living in spinal cord injury, and subsequently an 8-item sf-qualiveen was developed for those with multiple sclerosis (ms). the validity of this short form has not been previously examined using modern psychometric techniques, such as the rasch measurement model. objectivethe aim of this study is to test if the short form meets the requirements of the rasch model. methodsa total of 401 patients with clinically definite ms were given the questionnaire at three neuroscience centres in the uk. resultsa total of 258 patients (64.3% response) completed the questionnaire. the original scale failed to meet the expectations of the rasch model. a two-testlet solution was sought to account for local dependence, differential item functioning and disordered thresholds. after the modifications were made the scale fitted the model ((2)=5.93 p=0.4305), had high internal consistency (=0.88) and was unidimensional. conclusionssf-qualiveen is a simple and valid measure of the impact of urinary problems in multiple sclerosis, which meets the requirements of the rasch measurement model. summed ordinal scores can be converted to interval-level using the transformation table provided.
multiple_sclerosis	despite continuous interest in multiple sclerosis (ms) research, there is still a lack of neuroprotective strategies, because the main focus has remained on modulating the immune response. here we performed in-depth analysis of neurodegeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) and in in vitro studies regarding the effect of the well-established l-type calcium channel antagonist nimodipine. nimodipine treatment attenuated clinical eae and spinal cord degeneration and promoted remyelination. surprisingly, we observed calcium channel-independent effects on microglia, resulting in apoptosis. these effects were cell-type specific and irrespective of microglia polarization. apoptosis was accompanied by decreased levels of nitric oxide (no) and inducible no synthase (inos) in cell culture as well as decreased inos and reactive oxygen species levels in eae. in addition, increased numbers of olig2(+) apc(+) oligodendrocytes were detected. overall, nimodipine application seems to generate a favorable environment for regenerative processes and therefore could be a treatment option for ms, because it combines features of immunomodulation with beneficial effects on neuroregeneration.
multiple_sclerosis	background & purposeto describe methodology, interim baseline, and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (mri) acquisition parameter characteristics of the multiple sclerosis clinical outcome and mri in the united states (ms-mrius). material & methodsthe ms-mrius is an ongoing longitudinal and retrospective study of ms patients on fingolimod. clinical and brain mri image scan data were collected from 600 patients across 33 ms centers in the united states. mri brain outcomes included change in whole-brain volume, lateral ventricle volume, t2- and t1-lesion volumes, and new/enlarging t2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions. resultsinterim baseline and longitudinal mri acquisition parameters results are presented for 252 patients. mean age was 44 years and 81% were female. forty percent of scans had 3-dimensional (3d) t1 sequence in the preindex period, increasingto 50% in the postindex period. use of 2-dimensional (2d) t1 sequence decreased over time from 85% in the preindex period to 65% in the postindex. about 95% of the scans with flair and 2d t1-wi were considered acceptable or good quality compared to 99-100% with 3d t1-wi. there were notable changes in mri hardware, software, and coil (39.5% in preindex to index and 50% in index to postindex). mri sequence parameters (orientation, thickness, or protocol) differed for 36%, 29%, and 20% of index/postindex scans for flair, 2d t1-wi, and 3d t1-wi, respectively. conclusionsthe ms-mrius study linked the clinical and brain mri outcomes into an integrated database to create a cohort of fingolimod patients in real-world practice. variability was observed in mri acquisition protocols overtime.
multiple_sclerosis	aims: to better understand the impact of the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (ms) and disability on employment, absenteeism, and related factors. materials and methods: this study included respondents to the north american research committee on multiple sclerosis registry spring 2015 update survey who were us or canadian residents, aged 18-65 years and reported having relapsing-remitting ms (rrms), secondary progressive ms (spms), or primary progressive ms (ppms). the rrms and spms participants were combined to form the relapsing-onset ms (rms) group and compared with the ppms group regarding employment status, absenteeism, and disability. multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between employment-related outcomes and factors that may affect these relationships. results: of the 8004 survey respondents, 5887 (73.6%) were 18-65 years of age. the ppms group (n=344) had a higher proportion of males and older mean age at the time of the survey and at time of diagnosis than the rms group (n=4829). female sex, age, age at diagnosis, cognitive and hand function impairment, fatigue, higher disability levels, >= 3 comorbidities, and a diagnosis of ppms were associated with not working. after adjustment for disability, the employed ppms sub-group reported similar levels of absenteeism to the employed rms sub-group. limitations: limitations of the study include self-report of information and the possibility that participants may not fully represent the working-age ms population. conclusions: in ms, employment status and absenteeism are negatively affected by disability, cognitive impairment, and fatigue. these findings underscore the need for therapies that prevent disability progression and other symptoms that negatively affect productivity in persons with ms to enable them to persist in the workforce.
hepatitis_c	background: hepatitis c is an infectious liver disease with high mortality rate which is caused by hepatitis c virus. several treatment methods have been applied to combat this deadly virus including interferons, vaccine and direct acting antivirals (daas). however, the later shows promising effects in hcv treatment with lower adverse effect. specifically, the daas target the non-structural proteins (ns3 and ns5b). purpose: the objective of the present study is to hypothesize an alternative antiviral inhibitor for hcv from the available other antivirals. methods: computation of 2d molecular descriptors for the selected antiviral inhibitors followed by clustering the descriptor features. the closely clustered compounds were subjected to the interaction studies against the hcv target protein to validate the cluster result. results and discussion: the clustering result showed that indinavir (hiv inhibitor) and at130 (hbv inhibitor) molecule are close to the hcv inhibitor. the indinavir complexed with ns3 protein shows -5.33 kcal/mol and at-130 complexed with ns5b protein possess the binding energy of -8.87 kcal/mol. the docking interaction study indicated a better binding affinity than other viral inhibitors. conclusion: from the descriptor based feature similarity analysis and the interaction study, it can be concluded that indinavir and at-130 could be a potential alternative agent for hcv treatment.

hepatitis_c	background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections have increased during the past decade but little is known about geographic clustering patterns. methods: we used a unique analytical approach, combining geographic information systems (gis), spatial epidemiology, and statistical modeling to identify and characterize hcv hotspots, statistically significant clusters of census tracts with elevated hcv counts and rates. we compiled sociodemographic and hcv surveillance data (n = 99,780 cases) for massachusetts census tracts (n = 1464) from 2002 to 2013. we used a five-step spatial epidemiological approach, calculating incremental spatial autocorrelations and getis-ord gi* statistics to identify clusters. we conducted logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with the hcv hotspots. results: we identified nine hcv clusters, with the largest in boston, new bedford/fall river, worcester, and springfield (p < 0.05). in multivariable analyses, we found that hcv hotspots were independently and positively associated with the percent of the population that was hispanic (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 1.07; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.04, 1.09) and the percent of households receiving food stamps (aor: 1.83; 95% ci: 1.22, 2.74). hcv hotspots were independently and negatively associated with the percent of the population that were high school graduates or higher (aor: 0.91; 95% ci: 0.89, 0.93) and the percent of the population in the ""other"" race/ethnicity category (aor: 0.88; 95% ci: 0.85, 0.91). conclusion: we identified locations where hcv clusters were a concern, and where enhanced hcv prevention, treatment, and care can help combat the hcv epidemic in massachusetts. gis, spatial epidemiological and statistical analyses provided a rigorous approach to identify hotspot clusters of disease, which can inform public health policy and intervention targeting. further studies that incorporate spatiotemporal cluster analyses, bayesian spatial and geostatistical models, spatially weighted regression analyses, and assessment of associations between hcv clustering and the built environment are needed to expand upon our combined spatial epidemiological and statistical methods.
hepatitis_c	we previously generated an oral hepatitis c virus (hcv) vaccine using bifidobacterium displaying the hcv nonstructural protein 3 (ns3) polypeptide. ns3-specific cellular immunity is important for viral clearance and recovery from hcv infection. in this study, we enhanced the cellular immune responses induced by our oral hcv vaccine, bifidobacterium longum 2165 (b. longum 2165), by combining interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) as an adjuvant with the vaccine in a mouse experimental model. ifn-alpha is a widely used cytokine meeting the standard of care (soc) for hcv infection and plays various immunoregulatory roles. we treated c57bl/6n mice with b. longum 2165 every other day and/or ifn-alpha twice a week for a month and then analyzed the immune responses using spleen cells. we determined the induction of ns3-specific cellular immunity by cytokine quantification, intracellular cytokine staining, and a cytotoxic t lymphocyte (ctl) assay targeting el4 tumor cells expressing ns3/4a protein (el4-ns3/4a). we also treated mice bearing el4-ns3/4a tumor with the combination therapy in vivo. the results confirmed that the combination therapy of b. longum 2165 and ifn-a induced significantly higher ifn-gamma secretion, higher population of cd4(+)t and cd8(+)t cells secreting ifn-gamma, and higher ctl activity against el4-ns3/4a cells compared with the control groups of phosphate-buffered saline, b. longum 2165 alone, and ifn-alpha alone (p < 0.05). we also confirmed that the combination therapy strongly enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effects in vivo with no serious adverse effects (p < 0.05). these results suggest that the combination of b. longum 2165 and ifn-alpha could induce a strong cellular immunity specific to ns3 protein as a combination therapy augmenting the current soc immunotherapy against chronic hcv infection.
hepatitis_c	aim/objectives/backgroundchronic hepatitis c (chc) virus infection is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. in germany, as in many other countries, there is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological data. routine data from sickness funds can support the estimation of the true prevalence and incidence of chc.methodsin this article, the results of annual and quarterly analyses of prevalence and incidence for the years 2007-2013 are presented using data of several german sickness funds.resultsoverall, the prevalence rate remained relatively stable at 0.2%, which is lower than the general assumption for germany of 0.3%.conclusionwe found that despite the introduction of the breakthrough designated triple therapies with telaprevir or boceprevir in 2011, there was no increase of prevalence or incidence between 2010 and 2011. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
hepatitis_c	introduction: with thewidespread introduction of the integrase (in) inhibitors into clinical practice, transmission of drug resistance to this class of antiretroviralmedications may expand. the aimof this studywas to analyze the recent patterns of in resistance in treatment naive individuals in northern poland and its association with transmitted protease (pr) and reverse transcriptase (rt) mutations. methods: study included 172 pr, rt and ini sequences from antiretroviral treatment naive hiv-1 infected patients linked to care in northern poland from 2010 to 2015. drug resistance was interpreted based on the who surveillance and ias-usa mutation lists. for phylogeny maximum likelihood and bayesian monte carlo markov chain analyses were used. results: overall rate of transmitted drug resistancewas 12.21%. nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nrti) resistance associated substitutionswere found in 11.05% of cases and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance variants in 1.16%. in multivariate models transmitted resistance strongly associated with subtype d infections [66.67% compared to the 3.84% for subtype b (p = 0.001)]. no transmission of major protease or integrasemutationswere observed. polymorphisms associatedwith resistance against integrase inhibitor, mostly e157q, were found in 21.5% sequences and associated with female (31.91% vs. 15.2% for male, p = 0.01), injection drug use (84.21% compared to 22.08% for heterosexual and 1.39% for men-who-have-sex-with-men transmissions, p<0.0001) as well as hepatitis c coinfection [63.64% for positive, versus 8.57% for hcv antibody negative, p<0.0001]. clusters of nucleoside reverse transcriptase mutations in subtype d and integrase e157q variants in subtype b were observed. conclusions: transmitted drug resistance frequency was high in subtype d but limited to clustered nrti mutations, being infrequent among subtype b infected cases. despite lack of major integrase resistance in treatment naive patients, variants potentially affecting susceptibility to this classwere common, which indicates the potential need for extended surveillance in the near future.

weight_loss	the transport of nano-scale particles has become increasingly important, but the knowledge base available is limited. this study aims to bridge the knowledge gap between the nano-and micro-scales for pneumatic conveying. a key parameter is the minimum pickup velocity (u-pu), which is the minimum fluid velocity required to initiate motion in a particle originally at rest. the u-pu values of nine alumina particles with particle diameters (d(p)) ranging from 5 to 110,000 nm were determined using the weight loss method, then compared against the established pickup zones (analogous to the geldart groups). results indicated that: (1) u-pu varied non-monotonically with increasing d(p), thus revealing the missing link between the nano- and micro-scales; (2) the intermediate particle diameters surprisingly did not agree with any pickup zone; (3) zone iii (analogous to geldart group c) is inadequate for all the nano-scale particles, so new boundaries and a new zone are proposed.

weight_loss	background: neonates are expected to have weight loss in the first few days of life. many factors are considered to affect newborn weight loss such as breastfeeding adequacy, maternal parity, intravenous fluids administered during labor, and environmental factors. most of the studies have yielded variable results. the primary objective of this study was to assess the pattern of newborn weight loss in initial 72 h after birth and the factors affecting it. the secondary objective was to assess the impact of initial weight loss on neonatal jaundice beyond 72 h and regaining birth weight at the 10(th) day of life. materials and methods: a study was carried out on 250 term exclusively breastfed newborn babies. neonates were weighed initially at birth and then regularly at 12 hourly intervals for 72 h. data pertaining to various maternal factors affecting neonatal weight loss, birth weight of newborns, and adequacy of breastfeeding were recorded. the weight of the neonates on the 10(th) day was also recorded. results: about 79.2% of babies lost 5%u10% of birth weight and 12.8% of babies lost more than 10%. the maximum weight loss occurred between 60 and 72 h of life. the mean (standard deviation [sd]) percentage of weight loss in babies with inadequate breastfeeding was 9.01 (2.58) compared to 7.31 (1.82) in the adequately breastfed babies (p < 0.001). the mean (sd) percentage of weight loss in babies born to primipara was 8.31 (1.77) and in multipara it was 7.51 (2.43) (p = 0.005). neonates who developed significant jaundice had a mean (sd) percentage weight loss of 9.87 (3.40) compared to the rest in whom it was 7.59 (1.92) (p < 0.001). in the subgroup of babies who lost 10% of birth weight at 72 h, 88.2% did not regain birth weight on day 10 of life as compared to 55% of babies in the subgroup with weight loss <10% (p < 0.003). conclusion: regular monitoring of weight in exclusively breastfed babies is potentially useful. particular attention may need to be given to primipara mothers and babies who lose more than 10% weight by 72 h.
weight_loss	background: general health promoting campaigns are often not targeted at the people who need them the most. web- and app-based tools are a new way to reach, motivate, and help people with poor health status. objective: the aim of our study was to test a web- and mobile app-based tool(""sosu-life"") on employees in the social welfare and health care sector in denmark. methods: a randomized controlled trial was carried out as a workplace intervention. the tool was designed to help users make healthy lifestyle changes such as losing weight, exercise more, and quit smoking. a team competition between the participating workplaces took place during the first 16 weeks of the intervention. twenty nursing homes for elderly people in 6 municipalities in denmark participated in the study. the employees at the nursing homes were randomized either 1: 1 or 2: 1 on a municipality level to use the sosu-life tool or to serve as a control group with no intervention. all participants underwent baseline measurements including body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol level and they filled in a questionnaire covering various aspects of health. the participants were measured again after 16 and 38 weeks. results: a total of 566 (sosu-life: n = 355, control: n = 211) participants were included in the study. at 16 weeks there were 369 participants still in the study (sosu-life: n = 227, control: n = 142) and 269 participants completed the 38 week intervention (sosu-life: n = 152, control: n = 117). at 38 weeks, the sosu-life group had a larger decrease in body weight (-1.01 kg, p =. 03), body fat percentage (-0.8%, p =. 03), and waist circumference (-1.8 cm, p =. 007) compared with the control group. conclusions: the sosu-life web- and app-based tool had a modest yet beneficial effect on body weight and body fat percentage in the health care sector staff.
weight_loss	corrosion tests were conducted under static conditions at 450 and 550 a degrees c for various oxygen contents and durations with single crystal and sintered alumina regarded as model materials for ceramics. extremely pure and dense sintered alumina exhibited no intergranular corrosion and identical behavior as single crystal. corrosion appeared to proceed by reaction of al2o3 with dissolved oxygen (na2o) to form sodium aluminate (naalo2). then, sodium aluminate was dissolved in liquid sodium by a mechanism that is still to be elucidated. the corrosion morphology was equivalent to dissolution. from weight loss measurement, linear kinetics were found with a constant dissolution rate of (61 +/- 2)10(-4) mg dm(-2) h(-1) at 550 a degrees c and low oxygen content (< 1 ppm). no significant corrosion rate could be measured at 450 a degrees c and low oxygen content. an order reaction kinetics with respect to dissolved oxygen content of 0.6 +/- 0.2 was found.
weight_loss	we aim to review the available literature on obese patients treated with bariatric procedures, in order to assess their effect on the metabolic and gut microbiota profiles. a systematic literature search was performed in pubmed, cochrane library, and scopus databases, in accordance with the prisma guidelines. twenty-two studies (562 patients) met the inclusion criteria. this study points to significant amelioration of postoperative levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, ldl, hdl, homa-ir, food intake, and diabetes remission. branched-chain amino acids (bcaas) decreased, while trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao); glucagon-like peptide 1, 2 (glp-1, glp-2); and peptide yy (pyy) increased postoperatively. postoperative gut microbiota was similar to that of lean and less obese objects. well-designed randomized trials are necessary to further assess the host metabolic-microbial cross-talk after bariatric procedures.
low_testosterone	objective: obesity-associated hypogonadism is hypothesized to be due to the suppressive effect of high estradiol (from an increase in aromatase activity present in the abundant adipose tissue) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal unit resulting in low testosterone production. although weight loss has been found to be effective in reducing estradiol and raising testosterone levels in studies of younger men, its effect in frail, obese older men is understudied. thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of lifestyle intervention on hormone levels in frail, obese older men. design: randomized controlled trial of lifestyle intervention in frail, obese older men (>= 65 yo) for 1 year. setting: university hospital. methods: forty frail, obese elderly men were randomized, for a 52-week study, to any of the following treatment groups: (1) control group, (2) diet-induced weight loss group (diet group), (3) exercise training group (exercise group), and (4) diet-induced weight loss and exercise training group (diet-exercise group). the objective was to achieve a similar to 10 % weight loss at 6 months and maintain this weight for an additional 6 months. physical function was assessed by the modified physical performance testing (modified ppt). estradiol was measured by radioimmunoassay, testosterone by automated immunoassay, and sex hormone-binding globulin by enzyme-linked immunoassay. results: after 12 months of intervention, diet alone resulted in a weight loss of -10.1 +/- 1.9 kg in the diet group and -9.1 +/- 0.9 kg in the diet-exercise group. this resulted in a significant decrease (both p<0.05) in total estradiol compared to baseline among subjects in the diet (-2.5 +/- 1.3 pg/ml) and diet-exercise group (-2.2 +/- 4.0 pg/ml). free estradiol index also significantly decreased (both p<0.05) in both the diet (-0.39 +/- 0.14 pmol/nmol) and diet-exercise (-0.52 +/- 0.12 pmol/nmol) group. total testosterone significantly increased (p<0.05) in response to diet (71.0 +/- 21.0 ng/dl) and diet-exercise (49.9 +/- 15.5 pg/ml) resulting in values of 287.0 +/- 28.1 ng/dl in the diet and 317.6 +/- 33.1 ng/dl in the diet-exercise group. however, because there was a significant increase in sex hormonebinding globulin levels in both the diet and diet-exercise groups, free testosterone index and the changes in free testosterone index were not significant compared to baseline. regardless of changes in hormonal levels, patients in the diet, exercise, and diet-exercise groups experienced significant improvements in the modified ppt from baseline. conclusion: weight loss from lifestyle intervention resulted in significant decreases in total and free estradiol levels in frail, obese older men, but this did not result in a clinically important increase in total testosterone nor a significant increase in free testosterone. thus, alternative forms of treatment in addition to lifestyle intervention may be necessary to improve the hormonal profile among these patients. nevertheless, whether further improvement in hormonal profile would result in better physical performance than what can be achieved by lifestyle alone in these subjects remains uncertain.
low_testosterone	background. we describe the recruitment of men for the testosterone (t) trials, which were designed to determine the efficacy of t treatment. methods. men were eligible if they were >= 65 years, had an average of two morning total t values300 ng/ml, and had symptoms and objective evidence of mobility limitation, sexual dysfunction, and/or low vitality. men had to be eligible for and enroll in at least one of these three main trials (physical function, sexual function, vitality). results. men were recruited primarily through mass mailings in 12 u.s. communities: 82% of men who contacted the sites did so in response to mailings. men who responded were screened by telephone to ascertain eligibility. of 51,085 telephone screens, 53.5% were eligible for further screening. of 23,889 initial screening visits (sv1), 2,781 (11.6%) men were eligible for the second screening visit (sv2), which 2,261 (81.3%) completed. at sv2, 931 (41.2%) men met the criteria for one or more trials, the t level criterion and had no other exclusions. of these, 790 (84.6%) were randomized; 99 (12.5%) in all three trials and 348 (44%) in two trials. their mean age was 72 years and mean body mass index (bmi) was 31.0 kg/m(2). mean (standard deviation) total t (ng/dl) was 212.0 (40.0). conclusion: despite the telephone screening to enrollment ratio of 65 to 1, we met the recruitment goals for each trial. recruitment of symptomatic older men with low testosterone levels is difficult but feasible.
low_testosterone	prediabetes represents an elevation of plasma glucose above the normal range but below that of clinical diabetes. prediabetes includes individuals with ifg, igt, ifg with igt and elevated hba1c levels. insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction are characteristic of this disorder. the diagnosis of prediabetesis is vital as both ifg and igt are indeed well-known risk factors for type 2 diabetes with a greater risk in the presence of combined ifg and igt. furthermore, as will be illustrated in this review, prediabetes is associated with associated disorders typically only considered in with established diabetes. these include cardiovascular disease, periodontal disease, cognitive dysfunction, microvascular disease, blood pressure abnormalities, obstructive sleep apnea, low testosterone, metabolic syndrome, various biomarkers, fatty liver disease, and cancer. as the vast majority of individuals with prediabetes are unaware of their diagnosis, it is therefore vital that the associated conditions are identified, particularly in the presence of mild hyperglycemia, so they may benefit from early intervention.
low_testosterone	we report two newborns with female external genitalia and bilateral inguinal swelling who were diagnosed with 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency, a rare cause of 46,xy disorder of sexual development. the first case had normal clitoral size and vaginal and urethral openings, palpable gonads in the inguinal region, low testosterone, and low levels of basal and gnrh-stimulated gonadotropin. the second case had similar external genitalia, low testosterone but borderline basal and normal stimulated gonadotropin levels. low testosterone/androstenedione ratios (0.22 and 0.24, respectively; normal, >0.8) after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation indicated 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency. hsd17b3 sequencing revealed a homozygous novel mutation (c.464a>c, p.h155p) in exon 6 in the first case and homozygous c.239g>a (p.r80q) in exon 3 in the second.
low_testosterone	hypogonadism is common throughout the illness trajectory of patients with cancer. about two thirds of male patients with advanced cancer have hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction and low testosterone levels. chronic inflammation, comorbidities, cachexia, chemotherapy, and medications such as opioids, megestrol acetate, and corticosteroids contribute to primary and secondary hypogonadism. studies have reported increased symptom burden, diminished quality of life, and poor prognosis associated with low testosterone levels in males with cancer. the endocrine society has published clinical practice guidelines for replacing testosterone in symptomatic patients with chronic illness and in patients receiving opioids; however, the role of testosterone therapy specifically in patients with cancer is not addressed. this review explores the potential benefits and limitations of testosterone replacement on the basis of current evidence.
fungal_infection	granulocyte transfusions have a long history of being used in patients with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction to prevent and treat invasive fungal infections. however, there are limited and conflicting data concerning its clinical effectiveness, considerable variations in current granulocyte transfusion practices, and uncertainties about its benefit as an adjunct to modern antifungal therapy. in this review, we provide an overview on granulocyte transfusions and summarize the evidence on their role in the prevention and treatment of invasive fungal infections.
fungal_infection	background. solid organ transplant (sot) recipients are at risk of nocardiosis, a rare opportunistic bacterial infection, but prognosis and outcome of these patients are poorly defined. our objectives were to identify factors associated with 1-year mortality after nocardiosis and describe the outcome of patients receiving short-course antibiotics (<= 120 days). methods. we analyzed data from a multicenter european case-control study that included 117 sot recipients with nocardiosis diagnosed between 2000 and 2014. factors associated with 1-year all-cause mortality were identified using multivariable conditional logistic regression. results. one-year mortality was 10-fold higher in patients with nocardiosis (16.2%, 19/117) than in control transplant recipients (1.3%, 3/233, p<.001). a history of tumor (odds ratio [or], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-1.8), invasive fungal infection (or, 1.3; 95% ci, 1.1-1.5), and donor age (or, 1.0046; 95% ci, 1.0007-1.0083) were independently associated with 1-year mortality. acute rejection in the year before nocardiosis was associated with improved survival (or, 0.85; 95% ci, 0.73-0.98). seventeen patients received short-course antibiotics (median duration 56 [24-120] days) with a 1-year success rate (cured and surviving) of 88% and a 5.9% risk of relapse (median follow-up 49 [6-136] months). conclusions. one-year mortality was 10-fold higher in sot patients with nocardiosis than in those without. four factors, largely reflecting general medical condition rather than severity and/or management of nocardiosis, were independently associated with 1-year mortality. patients who received short-course antibiotic treatment had good outcomes, suggesting that this may be a strategy for further study.
fungal_infection	fungal infections like paecilomyces keratitis have emerged in childhood recently. the diagnosis and treatment of paecilomyces keratitis is difficult and the outcome is usually poor. corneal culture should be performed on fungal media such as sabouraud glucose neopeptone agar (sda) as soon as possible for diagnosis. we report a rare case of paecilomyces keratitis in an immunocompetent child, which was unresponsive to amphotericin b. the case was managed by a multidisciplinary approach involving the departments of ophthalmology, microbiology and pediatric infectious diseases. we want to draw attention once again that fungal keratitis caused by unusual agents are increasing. physicians should consider fungal causes of keratitis, in patients with some predisposing factors like ocular surgery and prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.
fungal_infection	objective. to investigate the spectrum, antibiotic-resistant pattern, risk factors, and outcomes of infection in patients hospitalized with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). methods. we collected the clinical and microbiological data from hospitalized patients with sle with infection between june 2005 and june 2015, and then conducted retrospective analyses. results. among our sample of 3815 hospitalized patients, 1321 (34.6%) were diagnosed with infection. the majority (78.3%) of infection occurred within 5 years of sle onset. bacterial infection was predominant (50.6%), followed by viral infection (36.4%) and fungal infection (12.5%). the lungs (33.7%) and upper respiratory tracts (26.3%) were most commonly affected. gram-negative bacteria (gnb) were predominant over gram-positive bacteria (178 isolates vs 90 isolates). the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli (24.6%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (13.4%) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (13.4%). multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains were detected in 26.9% of bacterial isolates. the most common fungus was candida spp. (99 episodes), followed by aspergillus (24 episodes) and cryptococcus neoformans (13 episodes). the overall mortality rate for this cohort was 2.2%; 48 patients died of infection. factors associated with bacterial and viral infection were higher systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index, renal involvement, thrombocytopenia, accumulated dose of glucocorticoids (gc), and treatment with cyclophosphamide (cyc). renal involvement, accumulated dose of gc, and treatment with cyc were associated with fungal infection. conclusion. infection was the leading cause of mortality in patients hospitalized with sle. there were some notable features of infection in chinese patients including early onset, higher proportion of respiratory tract involvement, predominance of gnb with emergence of mdr isolates, and a variety of pathogens.
fungal_infection	background: invasive fungal infection (ifi) is a fatal infection in haematology patients. there is an urgent need for reliable screening methods facilitating timely diagnosis and treatment. a real-time panfungal polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay based on taqman technology targeting 18s ribosomal rna gene was used to screen whole blood specimen obtained from series of haematology malignancy patients for ifis. materials and methods: the panfungal (pan-acf) assay was employed to investigate specimen from 133 patients in duplicate with suspected ifi. in addition twenty healthy subjects and twenty patients with bacterial infections were taken as control. the patients with suspected ifi were also diagnosed by conventional methods including direct microscopy, culture techniques and antigen detection (galactomannan antigen elisa and latex agglutination for cryptococcal antigen). the results of molecular testing were evaluated in relation to the criteria proposed by the european organization for research and treatment of cancer and patients were classified as having proven and probable ifd. results: of 133 patients, 89 had proven, 18 had probable and 26 had possible ifi. one hundred four samples were reverse transcription-pcr positive. of 89 proven cases, 84 were panfungal pcr positive. these 84 cases included 82 cases which revealed growth on fungal blood culture and two cases were negative on fungal blood culture. of the 82 cases which revealed growth on culture: 74 grew candida in culture, 3 grew fusarium solani, 5 grew aspergillus species on blood culture. the later five were also galactomannan antigen positive. the five specimen which were negative on panfungal pcr, two grew trichosporon asahii, one grew candida rugosa and two grew as cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. of the 18 probable cases, 18 were panfungal pcr positive. these were also galactomannan antigen positive. the sensitivity and specificity of panfungal pcr in proven cases were 94.3% and 95.2%, respectively. the positive and negative predictive values proven cases were 97.6% and 88.9%, respectively. conclusions: the panfungal (pan-acf) real-time pcr assay can detect common fungal genera and it may be used as an adjunct to conventional methods for screening of ifi.
diabetes	autoimmune diseases have a high prevalence in the population, and autoimmune thyroid disease (aitd) is one of the most common representatives. thyroid autoantibodies are not only frequently detected in patients with aitd but also in subjects without manifest thyroid dysfunction. the high prevalence raises questions regarding a potential role in extra -thyroidal diseases. this review summarizes the etiology and mechanism of aitd and addresses prevalence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, thyroid -stimulating hormone receptor (tshr), and anti-thyroglobulin and their action outside the thyroid. the main issues limiting the reliability of the conclusions drawn here include problems with different specificities and sensitivities of the antibody detection assays employed, as well as potential confounding effects of altered thyroid hormone levels, and lack of prospective studies. in addition to the well-known effects of tshr antibodies on fibroblasts in graves' disease (gd), studies speculate on a role of anti -thyroid antibodies in cancer. all antibodies may have a tumor -promoting role in breast cancer carcinogenesis despite anti -thyroid peroxidase antibodies having a positive prognostic effect in patients with overt disease. cross -reactivity with lactoperoxidase leading to induction of chronic inflammation might promote breast cancer, while anti -thyroid antibodies in manifest breast cancer might be an indication for a more active immune system. a better general health condition in older women with anti -thyroid peroxidase antibodies might support this hypothesis. the different actions of the anti -thyroid antibodies correspond to differences in cellular location of the antigens, titers of the circulating antibodies, duration of antibody exposure, and immunological mechanisms in gd and hashimoto 's thyroiditis.
diabetes	infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii (ab), an increasingly prevalent nosocomial pathogen, have been associated with high morbidity and mortality. we conducted this study to analyze the clinical features, outcomes, and factors influencing the survival of patients with ab bacteremia. we retrospectively examined the medical records of all patients developing ab bacteremia during their hospital stay at a tertiary care hospital in beirut between 2010 and 2015. ninety episodes of ab bacteremia were documented in eighty-five patients. univariate analysis showed that prior exposure to high dose steroids, diabetes mellitus, mechanical ventilation, prior use of colistin and tigecycline, presence of septic shock, and critical care unit stay were associated with a poor outcome. high dose steroids and presence of septic shock were significant on multivariate analysis. crude mortality rate was 63.5%. 70.3% of the deaths were attributed to the bacteremia. on acquisition, 39 patients had septicemia. despite high index of suspicion and initiation of colistin and/or tigecycline in 18/39 patients, a grim outcome could not be averted and 37 patients died within 2.16 days. seven patients had transient benign bacteremia; three of which were treated with removal of the line. the remaining four did not receive any antibiotics due to withdrawal of care and died within 26.25 days of acquiring the bacteremia, with no signs of persistent infection on follow up. a prolonged hospital stay is frequently associated with loss of functionality, and steroid and antibiotic exposure. these factors seem to impact the mortality of ab bacteremia, a disease with high mortality rate and limited therapeutic options.
diabetes	background and purpose it is now known that post-transplant graft function after deceased-donor liver transplantation and living-donor liver transplantation (ldlt) differ; however, there is no report assessing the relationship between graft function and the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (nodat). we conducted this study to identify the predictive risk factors for nodat, including graft function after ldlt. methods the subjects of this study were 175 adult recipients who underwent ldlt at kyoto university hospital between 2006 and 2010, and survived for more than 3 months (median observation period, 1046 days). results the 1-, 2-, and 3-year incidences of nodat after ldlt were 26.1, 32.0, and 33.4%, respectively. pre-transplant diabetes was associated with poor survival (p = 0.0048), whereas nodat was not associated with patient survival. in the multivariate analysis, recipient age >= 40, a tacrolimus trough level >= 8 ng/ml 3 months after ldlt, and cholinesterase (che) < 185 iu/l 3 months after ldlt were the independent risk factors for nodat. conclusions poor graft synthetic function 3 months after ldlt as well as older age of the recipient and a higher tacrolimus concentration were strongly associated with nodat development after ldlt.
diabetes	non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and can be considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. nafld represents a spectrum of disease, from the relatively benign simple steatosis to the more serious non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver failure, necessitating liver transplantation. although the increasing prevalence of nafld in developed countries has substantial implications for public health, many of the precise mechanisms accounting for the development and progression of nafld are unclear. the environment in early life is an important determinant of cardiovascular disease risk in later life and studies suggest this also extends to nafld. here we review data from animal models and human studies which suggest that fetal and early life exposure to maternal under- and overnutrition, excess glucocorticoids and environmental pollutants may confer an increased susceptibility to nafld development and progression in offspring and that such effects may be sex-specific. we also consider studies aimed at identifying potential dietary and pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing this risk. we suggest that further human epidemiological studies are needed to ensure that data from animal models are relevant to human health.
diabetes	endogenous alcohol has been applied for spontaneous ethanol production via different metabolic pathways of the human body. auto-brewery syndrome describes the patients with alcohol intoxication after ingesting carbohydrate-rich meals. the main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus (dm), liver cirrhosis (lc) and presence of both (dm and lc) on blood alcohol concentration (bac) especially after carbohydrate ingestion. bac has been measured by headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in three groups of humans namely control, dm, lc and both (dm and lc) groups. the results showed that bac in control group was 0.01-.3 mg/dl with mean 0.3 +/- 0.41 mg/dl. in patients with dm, bac is significantly higher than that of control group 4.85 +/- 3.96 mg/dl. in patients with lc, bac was 3.45 +/- 2.65 mg/dl. in patients with both dm and lc, bac increases to reach 10.88 +/- 5.36 mg/dl. endogenous ethanol production appears to increase in dm and lc. also, it increased much more in patients with both diseases, but it did not reach toxic levels. on comparing bac and blood glucose level in each group, all groups show insignificant correlations (p >0.05).
parenting	the increase in fathers' involvement in childrearing, particularly beyond infancy, warrants research exploring factors influencing the quality of child-father attachment relationships, and the impact of these relationships on children 's social development. the current investigation explored various correlates of preschoolers' child-father attachment security to both parents, including contextual factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, child temperament, parenting stress), parental play sensitivity, and child social adaptation. participants included 107 preschool-aged children (59 girls; m = 46.67 months, sd = 8.57) and their fathers and mothers. results revealed that both mothers' and fathers' play sensitivity were associated with child attachment security after controlling for different contextual factors. furthermore, the magnitude of the association between child conduct problems and child-father attachment insecurity was stronger than the corresponding association with child-mother attachment insecurity. findings provide important information on caregiving factors associated with child-father attachment security in the preschool years and the importance of this bond to children 's social adaptation.
parenting	this article explores pre-school reform and shifting norms of parenthood in singapore. whereas current education reforms in many western countries focus on improving academic performance, pre-school reform in singapore de-emphasises academic learning and urges parents to adopt 'relaxed' parenting practices. analysing the position of parents in this process, we show, however, that the outcomes of this reform project are highly ambivalent. reform makers view parents' mindset as the main obstacle to reform, while parents experience pre-school reform itself as prompting inconsistent messages. to account for the disorientation that this creates among parents, we draw on bateson 's concept of double bind.

parenting	aims: developing and evaluating an email-based intervention (ebi) to enhance alcohol-related parenting skills and reduce alcohol consumption among adolescents. methods: over four weeks, participating parents received a weekly email containing scientific findings, practical advice and exercises in relation to such topics as alcohol-related rule-setting and communication. using a randomised controlled trial (id: drks00007763), data from 467 parents and 173 adolescents were collected via self-report online questionnaires and analysed by means of repeated measures analysis of variance. findings: controlling for baseline, parents in the intervention group (ig) scored higher for being informed (parents of girls: f=19.023, p=0.000; parents of boys: f=30.294, p=0.000) and for self-efficacy (parents of girls: f=6.122, p=0.014; parents of boys: f=10.195, p=0.002) at follow-up and, in the case of boys, were more successful in maintaining strict rules on alcohol consumption (f=13.704, p=0.000) than parents in the control group (cg) (girls: f=1.627; p=0.204). boys whose parents were in the ig reported less heavy episodic drinking at follow-up (f=4.192, p=0.043), controlled for baseline, than those with parents in the cg (girls: f=0.567; p=0.454). conclusions: the ebi has positive effects on alcohol-related parenting and may reduce heavy episodic drinking among boys. since it is delivered via email, the programme has considerable potential to reach many parents at low cost.
parenting	one of the most important considerations in designing clinical infant research studies is the selection of reliable and valid measurement procedures. few measures of caregiver-child interactions have been studied with newborns, particularly premature infants. the main objective of this study was to examine psychometric properties of the national institute of child health and human development (nichd) mother-child interaction qualitative ratings in a sample of premature infants and their mothers to evaluate its use in the neonatal intensive care unit. mother-baby dyads (n = 24) were videotaped in a 10-min interaction in the nicu. nine raters independently assessed dyadic interactions using the nichd mother-child interaction qualitative ratings in a fully crossed research design. rater reliability was strong for mother and infant ratings (. 76-.94). scores yielded normal distributions for maternal sensitivity, positive regard, and flatness of affect and skewed distributions for maternal intrusiveness, detachment, negative regard, and all child ratings. positive maternal behaviors correlated positively with one another and negatively with negative maternal behaviors. thus, preliminary analyses suggest that scores obtained using the nichd mother-child interaction qualitative ratings with premature babies and their mothers in the neonatal intensive care unit demonstrate adequate interrater reliability, and distributional properties provide preliminary evidence of face validity.
parenting	objective: this study examined the prospective association of parental reports of intimate partner violence (ipv) involvement (perpetration and/or victimization) with offspring trauma symptoms an average of 6 years later and the moderating influence of positive and negative parenting. method: the children in the community study followed a representative sample of youth (generation 2) and their parents (generation 1) over 25 years, including their own offspring (generation 3) in the final 2 of these 7 assessments. the sample includes male (n = 92) and female (n = 151) original generation 2 study members who completed measures of ipv and had children (generation 3) by wave 5 (1999). parents completed measures of parenting at wave 6 (2001-2004), and child 's trauma symptoms at wave 7 (2006-08). results: ipv predicted child trauma symptoms, controlling for demographic risks. for fathers, but not mothers, this association held when controlling for stressful life events and psychopathology. ipv predicted lower positive and higher negative parenting practices. positive parenting moderated the association of ipv with child trauma symptoms. conclusion: childhood exposure to ipv between parents may increase the distal risk for trauma symptoms. ipv predicts more negative and less supportive parenting practices. positive parenting may be protective, though perhaps not at extreme levels of ipv.
birth_control	background: among adolescent pregnancies, 75% are unintended. greater use of highly-effective contraception can reduce unintended pregnancy. although multiple studies discuss adolescent contraceptive use, there is no consensus regarding the use of long-acting reversible contraception as a first-line contraception option. objective: we performed a systematic review of the medical literature to assess the continuation of long-acting reversible contraceptives among adolescents. study design: ovid-medline, cochrane databases, and embase databases were searched using key words relevant to the provision of long-acting contraception to adolescents. articles published from january 2002 through august 2016 were selected for inclusion based on specific key word searches and detailed review of bibliographies. for inclusion, articles must have provided data on method continuation, effectiveness, or satisfaction of at least 1 long-acting reversible contraceptive method in participants= 6 months. long-acting reversible contraceptive methods included intrauterine devices and the etonogestrel implant. only studies in the english language were included. guidelines, systematic reviews, and clinical reviews were examined for additional citations and relevant points for discussion. of 1677 articles initially identified, 90 were selected for full review. of these, 12 articles met criteria for inclusion. all studies selected for full review were extracted by multiple reviewers; inclusion was determined by consensus among authors. for studies with similar outcomes, forest plots of combined effect estimates were created using the random effects model. the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology guidelines were followed. primary outcomes measured were continuation of method at 12 months, and expulsion rates for intrauterine devices. results: this review included 12 studies, including 6 retrospective cohort studies, 5 prospective observational studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial. the 12 studies included 4886 women age <25 years: 4131 intrauterine device users and 755 implant users. the 12-month continuation of any long-acting reversible contraceptive device was 84.0% (95% confidence interval, 79.0-89.0%). intrauterine device continuation was 74.0% (95% confidence interval, 61.0-87.0%) and implant continuation was 84% (95% confidence interval, 77.0e91.0%). among postpartum adolescents, the 12-month long-acting reversible contraceptive continuation rate was 84.0% (95% confidence interval, 71.0-97.0%). the pooled intrauterine device expulsion rate was 8.0% (95% confidence interval, 4.0-11.0%). conclusion: adolescents and young women have high 12-month continuation of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods. intrauterine devices and implants should be offered to all adolescents as first-line contraceptive options.
birth_control	a method of birth control often called 'revolutionary' was implemented in many western countries in the 1960s. the contraceptive pill allowed women to engage in sexual experiences without the permanent fear of pregnancy. this safe method was especially important for the group of unmarried or newlywed women who were in the middle of their academic or vocational education and wanted to combine career and family life. in the 1970s, however, and especially under the influence of the women 's liberation movement, attitudes towards the pill changed. it was no longer seen as an emancipation of female sexuality, but as an instrument of the on-going male domination of sexuality and society in general. according to this point of view, issues such as sexuality and contraception that had so far been regarded as 'private' became political. women now directly linked their very personal intimate experiences and questions of power and gender relations in society, and this often meant stopping taking the pill. this article examines the particular reasons for the shift in contraceptive behaviour in west germany and england. it analyses the changing attitudes of feminist activists toward the pill and their influence on women 's decisions about birth control.
birth_control	average happiness in big cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants is, in the usa, lower than average happiness in towns and in the country. adam kozaryn offers several explanations. one explanation is that core characteristics of cities, such as size, density and heterogeneity lead to a deterioration of social relations. this explanation is insufficient because average happiness in cities can also be relatively high, as is the case in poor nations, compared to happiness in towns and in the country. important factors like relative safety and the availability of services have to be considered additionally. a second explanation is that capitalism plays a more dominant role in cities, with similar negative effects. this explanation is also insufficient because the negative effects of capitalism are not limited to cities. a more plausible explanation is that average happiness in american cities is relatively low, because of the interaction of their core characteristics and capitalism. more people should live in smaller places, but this is impossible. there are too many people and big cities are needed to minimize their ecological footprint. overpopulation is the root of the problem. a discussion about the maximum size of the population is needed. there is no reason to fear for a negative impact on individual freedom, but people can pay attention to this discussion if they make up their mind about having children.
birth_control	an historical analysis of reproductive politics in the canadian north during the 1970s necessitates a careful reading of the local circumstances regarding feminism, sovereignty, language, colonialism, and access to health services, which differed regionally and culturally. these features were conditioned, however, by international discussions on family planning that fixated on the twinned concepts of unchecked population growth and poverty. language from these debates crept into discussions about reproduction and birth control in northern canada, producing the state 's logic that, despite low population density, the endemic poverty in the north necessitated aggressive family planning measures.
birth_control	objectives: as life expectancy for women with cystic fibrosis (cf) improves, reproductive decision-making is becoming increasingly relevant. we sought to characterize fertility intentions, contraceptive use, and preferences among adult females with cf. study design: we conducted a cross-sectional survey of contraceptive use and preferences in reproductive-aged women with cf. subjects were recruited via an electronic mailing list from the penn adult cystic fibrosis program. results: fifty-three women with cf responded and met eligibility criteria. most (83%) were sexually active, however only 49% used contraception. condoms and the oral contraceptive pill were the most commonly used methods. compared to the national contraceptive use among caucasian women (65%), use in our cohort was significantly lower (p = 0.01). participants prioritized effectiveness and ease of use in their contraceptive method; they wanted to avoid side effects and interference with sexual enjoyment. although these priorities are similar to caucasian women in the literature, additional contraceptive priorities differed significantly between the groups. conclusions: this cf cohort is sexually active but contraceptive utilization was low, and women with cf identify specific contraceptive preferences. there is a significant unmet need for contraception among women with cf.

heart_disease	background in the syntax (synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with taxus and cardiac surgery) trial, patients with 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (cad) had improved long-term outcomes with coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) surgery compared with percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with drug-eluting stents (des), improvements driven mainly by differences in myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization. objectives this study compared the long-term quality-of-life benefits of des-pci versus cabg for patients with 3-vessel or left main cad. methods between 2005 and 2007, the syntax trial randomized 1,800 patients with 3-vessel or left main cad to either cabg or des-pci. health status was assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, 36, and 60 months by using the seattle angina questionnaire (saq) and the 36-item short form health survey. results at 5-year follow-up, cabg was superior to des-pci on several saq domains including angina frequency and physical function, as well as the role physical and role emotional scales of the 36-item short form health survey. subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between angiographic complexity (as assessed by the syntax score) and angina relief (mean difference in the saq angina frequency score for cabg vs. pci of -0.9, 3.3, and 3.9 points for low, intermediate, and high syntax score patients, respectively; p = 0.048 for interaction). conclusions among patients with 3-vessel or left main cad, both cabg and des-pci were associated with substantial and sustained quality-of-life benefits over 5 years of follow-up. in general, cabg resulted in greater angina relief, although the absolute treatment benefit was small. angina relief at 5 years was enhanced with cabg among patients with high syntax scores, a finding reinforcing the recommendation that cabg should be strongly preferred for such patients.

heart_disease	physiologic adaptations during pregnancy unmask a woman 's predisposition to diseases. complications are increasingly predicted by first-trimester algorithms, amplify a pre-existing maternal phenotype and accelerate risks for chronic diseases in the offspring up to adulthood (barker hypothesis). recent evidence suggests that vice versa, pregnancy diseases also indicate maternal and even grandparent 's risks for chronic diseases (reverse barker hypothesis). pub-med and embase were reviewed for mesh terms ""fetal programming"" and ""pregnancy complications combined with maternal disease"" until january 2017. studies linking pregnancy complications to future cardiovascular, metabolic, and thrombotic risks for mother and offspring were reviewed. women with a history of miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, subfertility, and thrombophilia more frequently demonstrate with echocardiographic abnormalities, higher fasting insulin, deviating lipids or clotting factors and show defective endothelial function. thrombophilia hints to thrombotic risks in later life. pregnancy abnormalities correlate with future cardiovascular and metabolic complications and earlier mortality. conversely, women with a normal pregnancy have lower rates of subsequent diseases than the general female population creating the term: ""pregnancy as a window for future health."" although the placenta works as a gatekeeper, many pregnancy complications may lead to sickness and earlier death in later life when the child becomes an adult. the epigenetic mechanisms and the mismatch between pre-and postnatal life have created the term ""fetal origin of adult disease."" up to now, the impact of cardiovascular, metabolic, or thrombotic risk profiles has been investigated separately for mother and child. in this manuscript, we strive to illustrate the consequences for both, fetus and mother within a cohesive perspective and thus try to demonstrate the complex interrelationship of genetics and epigenetics for long-term health of societies and future generations. maternal-fetal medicine specialists should have a key role in the prevention of non-communicable diseases by implementing a framework for patient consultation and interdisciplinary networks. health-care providers and policy makers should increasingly invest in a stratified primary prevention and follow-up to reduce the increasing number of manifest cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and to prevent waste of health-care resources.
heart_disease	the psychosocial environment and especially various psychosocial risks in childhood have been shown to predict later negative health behavior and health problems. in this study, we examined whether various psychosocial factor domains in childhood and adolescence: socioeconomic status, theemotional family environment (parental nurturance, life-satisfaction), parental lifestyle, life-events, the child 's self-regulatory behavior and the child 's social adaptation were associated with body mass index (bmi) trajectories individually by domain and as a cumulative score across domains. the participants were a nationally representative sample of 2016 men and women fromthe young finns study aged 3-18 years at study entry in 1980. their bmi wasmeasured at six study phases from 1980 to 2012. their parents reported all the factors related to their psychosocial environment in 1980. the participants responded to questions on adulthood socioeconomic status in 2007. the accumulation of psychosocial factors in childhood was the main exposure variable. the findings fromrepeated measuresmultilevelmodeling showed that parental lifestyle and life-events and the more positive cumulative psychosocial factors score were associated with a slower increase in bmi during follow-up (regression coefficient range from - 0.06 to -0.50). in conclusion, the psychosocial environment in childhood and adolescence, particularly parental lifestyle and lack of stressful life-events, are associated with a lower increase of bmi.

heart_disease	recent insights into the bioactivation and signaling actions of inorganic, dietary nitrate and nitrite now suggest a critical role for the microbiome in the development of cardiac and pulmonary vascular diseases. once thought to be the inert, end-products of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (no) heme-oxidation, nitrate and nitrite are now considered major sources of exogenous no that exhibit enhanced vasoactive signaling activity under conditions of hypoxia and stress. the bioavailability of nitrate and nitrite depend on the enzymatic reduction of nitrate to nitrite by a unique set of bacterial nitrate reductase enzymes possessed by specific bacterial populations in the mammalian mouth and gut. the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (ph), obesity, hypertension and cvd are linked to defects in no signaling, suggesting a role for commensal oral bacteria to shape the development of ph through the formation of nitrite, no and other bioactive nitrogen oxides. oral supplementation with inorganic nitrate or nitrate-containing foods exert pleiotropic, beneficial vascular effects in the setting of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, ischemia-reperfusion injury and in pre-clinical models of ph, while traditional high-nitrate dietary patterns are associated with beneficial outcomes in hypertension, obesity and cvd. these observations highlight the potential of the microbiome in the development of novel nitrate-and nitrite-based therapeutics for ph, cvd and their risk factors.
heart_disease	objective: unusual clinical course background: acute coronary syndrome (acs) can present with atypical chest pain or symptoms not attributed to heart disease, such as indigestion. hiccups, a benign and self-limited condition, can become persistent or intractable with overlooked underlying etiology. there are various causes of protracted hiccups, including metabolic abnormalities, psychogenic disorders, malignancy, central nervous system pathology, medications, pulmonary disorders, or gastrointestinal etiologies. it is rarely attributed to cardiac disease. case report: we report a case of intractable hiccups in a 51-year-old male with cocaine related myocardial infarction (mi) before and after stent placement. coronary angiogram showed in-stent thrombosis of the initial intervention. following thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty, and stent, the patient recovered well without additional episodes of hiccups. although hiccups are not known to present with a predilection for a particular cause of myocardial ischemia, this case may additionally be explained by the sympathomimetic effects of cocaine, which lead to vasoconstriction of coronary arteries. conclusions: hiccups associated with cardiac enzyme elevation and ekg st-segment elevation before and after percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) maybe a manifestation of acute mi with or without stent. the fact that this patient was a cocaine user may have contributed to the unique presentation.
allergies	aim: we previously reported a protective effect of maternal omega-3 fatty acid supplements on the development of immunoglobulin e (ige)-associated disease in infancy. this study assessed omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa) in maternal milk in relation to omega-3 lcpufa supplementation and the development of allergic disease in their infants. methods: this study randomised 95 pregnant women at risk of having an allergic infant, to daily supplements of 2.6 g omega-3 lcpufa or a placebo of 2.7 g soya bean oil from gestational week 25 until 3 months of lactation. breast milk samples were collected as colostrum, at one and 3 months. milk fatty acids were related to allergic outcome in the infants at 24 months. results: omega-3 milk fatty acids were higher in women who received omega-3 supplements than the placebo group (p < 0.01). higher proportions of milk eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and a lower arachidonic/ eicosapentaenoic acid ratio were associated with an absence of ige-associated disease in the infants. none of the children developed ige-associated atopic eczema above a level of 0.83 mol% eicosapentaenoic acid in colostrum. [correction added on 7 july 2016, after online publication: in the preceding sentence, the correct word should be "" above"" instead of "" below"" and this has been amended in this current version.] conclusion: high omega-3 lcpufa milk levels in mothers who received omega-3 lcpufa supplements were related to fewer allergies in their children.
allergies	the aim of this study was to determine if extracts from selected spices (caraway, ginger, chili, sweet peppers, anise, sesame, nutmeg and black pepper) might be harmful to people suffering from celiac disease, wheat allergy or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. all of these spice extracts exhibited some reaction to antibodies found in sera from two celiac patients and to sera from rabbits that had been sensitized with the specific peptides, qqqpp, pqqq and qqqp. these peptides had sequences that might be included in active epitopes for celiac disease and wheat allergy. methodology followed in this study included elisa, sds-page and immunoblotting. the observed reactivities suggest that spice proteins might produce adverse reactions in celiac patients, patients with various wheat allergies or with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. however, further work would be needed to elucidate this possibility.
allergies	the effects of tissue type, harvest maturity, and genetic factors on the expression of genes that related to citrus fruit allergies remain poorly understood. in the present study, a multiplex real-time pcr assay was developed to monitor the expression of citrus allergen genes individually with the advantages of much fewer sample requirements and simultaneously multiple target genes detection. gene specific primer pairs and taqman probes of three citrus allergen genes cit s 1.01, cit s 2.01, and cit s 3.01 and the house-keeping gene beta-actin were designed based on gene sequence differences. the pcr results showed that differential expression patterns were found during the ripening process. the expression levels of cit s 3.01 were much higher than those of cit s 1.01 and cit s 2.01 in both peel and pulp tissues among 10 citrus cultivars. data suggested that kao phuang pummelo could be safely consumed with a potential low risk in allergenicity. considering that assessing allergenicity is one of the tests in food safety, this assay might also facilitate the breeding and production of ""allergy-friendly"" citrus fruits.
allergies	herein we present a retrospective study concerning the provision of school meals for children with food allergies to avoid specially selected menus where these did not seem essential and to improve the day-to-day quality of life of these children and their families. eighty-two children aged between 3 and 15 years presenting food allergies, primarily to peanuts and/or cashew nuts, partook of school meals without any specially prepared menus as part of the individualised meal project (projet d'accueil individualise [paid following a study concerning the reading of menus, conducted with the help of school doctors within the region as well as the various bodies responsible for school meals. based on advances in knowledge about and treatment of food allergies (fa) in recent years, we felt it was essential to be able to provide a personalised school meal service taking into account the serious nature of fa, french dietary habits and available data concerning allergic accidents associated with school meals.

allergies	at birth the piglet 's immune system is immature and it is dependent upon passive maternal protection until weaning. the piglet 's mucosal immune system develops over the first few weeks but has not reached maturity at weaning ages which are common on commercial farms. at weaning piglets are presented with a vast and diverse range of microbial and dietary/environmental antigens. their ability to distinguish between antigens and mount a protective response to potential pathogens and to develop tolerance to dietary antigens is critical to their survival and failure to do so is reflected in the high incidence of morbidity and mortality in the post-weaning period. a growing recognition that the widespread use of antibiotics to control infection during this critical period should be controlled has led to detailed studies of those factors which drive the development of the mucosal immune system, the role of gut microbiota in driving this process, the origin of the bacteria that colonise the young piglet 's intestine and the impact of rearing environment. this review briefly describes how the mucosal immune system is equipped to respond ""appropriately"" to antigenic challenge and the programmed sequence by which it develops. the results of studies on the critical interplay between the host immune system and gut microbiota are discussed along with the effects of rearing environment. by comparing these with results from human studies on the development of allergies in children, an approach to promote an earlier maturation of the piglet immune system to resist the challenges of weaning are outlined.
menopause	luteinizing hormone (lh) rises dramatically during and after menopause, and has been correlated with an increased incidence of alzheimer 's disease and decreased memory performance in humans and animal models. to test whether lh acts directly on the dorsal hippocampus to affect memory, ovariectomized female rats were infused with either the lh-homologue human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) or the lh receptor antagonist deglycosylated-hcg (dg-hcg). infusion of hcg into either the lateral ventricle or the dorsal hippocampus caused significant memory impairments in ovariectomized estradiol-treated females. consistent with this, infusion of the lh antagonist dg-hcg into the dorsal hippocampus caused an amelioration of memory deficits in ovariectomized females. furthermore, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist antide, failed to act in the hippo campus to affect memory. these findings demonstrate a significant role for lh action in the dorsal hippocampus in spatial memory dysfunction.

menopause	endometriosis is an uncommon disease in postmenopausal women (pmw), ranging from 2% to 5% of cases, and it is very important to exclude neoplastic transformation of the endometrium. the authors would like to introduce the case of a 63-year-old overweight patient with abdominal pain associated to pain and swelling of the left inferior limb occurring for approximately six weeks. the ct x-ray of the abdomen revealed the presence of a retroperitoneal mass causing deep vein thrombosis because of extrinsic compression of the left iliac vein. following removal of the pelvic masses with laparotomy, the histological exam revealed an endometriosis. the ct x-ray carried out after a month postoperatively revealed the root canal treatment of the left femoral vein with a considerable decrease of the thrombosis of homolateral external iliac veins. despite the endometriosis, it is uncommon in women who have reached menopause and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of pelvic masses.
menopause	objectives: to examine relationships between location, demographics, lifestyle, beliefs, and experience of hot flushes and night sweats (hfns) amongst women living in two cities in thailand. methods: cross-sectional study of peri- and postmenopausal women, aged 45-55 years, from bangkok and chiang mai. participants completed questionnaires (demographics, health, hfns (prevalence, frequency and problem-rating) and beliefs about menopause). a sub-sample of women from each location was interviewed. results: a total of 632 women (320 bangkok and 312 chiang mai) aged 50.88 (standard deviation 3.06) years, took part. the prevalence of hfns was 65%, average hfns frequency 8.7 (10.8) per week and problem rating 4.3/10. women from chiang mai had significantly more problematic hfns, but prevalence and frequency were similar in both sites. poor general health predicted hfns prevalence and frequency, while chiang mai location, hfns frequency, age, diet and beliefs about menopause were associated with problematic hfns. location remained significant after controlling for education, occupation and age; location was partially explained by beliefs. qualitative interview responses illustrated the differences in beliefs about menopause between locations. conclusion: hfns reports are prevalent with moderate frequency and problem-ratings in these urban centers in thailand. the results will be included in the broader international menopause society study of climate, altitude and temperature (ims-cat) of the impact of climate on hfns.
menopause	background some studies have already proposed an inverse association between vitamin d levels and breast density. as breast density is already considered an established risk factor for breast cancer, such a connection could offer a new starting point for the prevention of breast cancer. material and methods to investigate this suggested connection, a total of 412 pre- and 572 post-menopausal women for whom mammography was indicated were recruited into this cross-sectional study. in addition to a questionnaire-based interview on the patient 's general and gynecological medical history, her eating habits and lifestyle, serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d], calcium, phosphate and creatinine were determined. breast density was determined by mammography and categorized as 1 to 4 according to the acr classification. in addition to performing descriptive analysis to get a better overview of the data, a number of multivariate regression models were developed to determine the impact of confounders and the connection between vitamin d and mammographic density. results more than half of all participants had low levels of 25(oh)d (< 20 ng/ml) and only a small minority of women (5.7%) had what are currently considered to be optimal serum levels of 25(oh)d of at least 30 ng/ml. the significant majority of the cohort had a medium mammographic density (n = 463 had acr 2; n = 343 had acr 3). logistic regression analysis showed that lower 25(oh)d serum levels were associated significantly more often with high rather than medium breast density. this association remained, even after adjusting for other factors which influence breast density such as age, bmi and menopausal status (p = 0.032 for acr 4 vs. acr 2; p = 0.028 for acr 4 vs. acr 3). when the same analysis was done separately for pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women, bmi in both groups was found to be inversely correlated with breast density and this inverse correlation was highly significant. in post-menopausal women, age was found to be similarly correlated while 25(oh)d did not appear to be associated with acr. in pre-menopausal women the opposite was the case: although there was no correlation between age and breast density, higher vitamin d levels tended to be associated with lower breast density (p = 0.06 for acr 2 vs. acr 4) in this smaller sample (n = 412). when vitamin d-rich food and food supplements were also taken into account, regular intake of vitamin d preparations was associated with lower breast density; this association achieved borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05 for acr 3 vs. acr 4). when the analysis also took menopausal status into account, the breast density of pre-menopausal women was lower following regular vitamin d intake and this lower breast density of pre-menopausal women was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001 for acr 1 and acr 2 vs. acr 4, respectively). this effect was not found in post-menopausal women. frequent intake of vitamin d-containing nutrition had no significant impact on acr in either of the groups. conclusion these results reinforce the assumption previously proposed by several authors that higher levels of 25(oh)d pre-menopause and vitamin d substitution are associated with lower breast density and could reduce the risk of breast cancer. the findings did not confirm any post-menopausal association between vitamin d and mammographic breast density.
menopause	objectives: to examine trends in the relationship between smoking history and both general and central fatness in adults from a mediterranean setting. materials and methods: the encat 1992-1993 and 2002-2003 surveys were used; samples consisted of 482 men, 589 women from 1992-1993, and 515 men, 613 women from 2002-2003, aged 25-60 years. measured anthropometry and self-reported data on smoking habits, diet, lifestyle and ses were collected. general fatness was defined as who 's bmi overweight and obesity, and central fatness was defined as who 's increased-risk-for-metabolic-complications waist circumference (ir wc) and substantially-increased-risk wc (sir wc). simple logistic regression was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted associations between general/central fatness and smoking history. results: by 2002-2003, most associations observed in 1992-1993 had been strongly attenuated: only male current-heavy-smoking remained associated with ir/sir wc (three-fold) and female current-moderate-smokers were 0.57 times less likely to have an ir/sir wc (p <0.10). conclusions: although causality cannot be established, results suggest a positive association between heavy smoking and central fatness among men, but no association between former smoking and general/central fatness; findings strengthen arguments for promoting smoking cessation to reduce smoking and obesity associated morbidity and mortality
emergency_contraception	can administration of a prostaglandin (pg) e2 receptor 2 (ptger2) antagonist prevent pregnancy in adult female monkeys by blocking periovulatory events in the follicle without altering menstrual cyclicity or general health? this is the first study to demonstrate that a ptger2 antagonist can serve as an effective non-hormonal contraceptive in primates. the requirement for pge2 in ovulation and the release of an oocyte surrounded by expanded cumulus cells (cumulus-oocyte expansion; c-oe) was established through the generation of ptgs2 and ptger2 null-mutant mice. a critical role for pge2 in primate ovulation is supported by evidence that intrafollicular injection of indomethacin in rhesus monkeys suppressed follicle rupture, whereas co-injection of pge2 with indomethacin resulted in ovulation. first, controlled ovulation protocols were performed in adult, female rhesus monkeys to analyze the mrna levels for genes encoding pge2 synthesis and signaling components in the naturally selected pre-ovulatory follicle at different times after the ovulatory hcg stimulus (0, 12, 24, 36 h pre-ovulation; 36 h post-ovulation, n = 3-4/time point). second, controlled ovarian stimulation cycles were utilized to obtain multiple cumulus-oocyte complexes (cocs) from rhesus monkeys to evaluate the role of pge2 in c-oe in vitro (n = 3-4 animals/treatment; a parts per thousand yen3 cocs/animal/treatment). third, adult cycling female cynomolgus macaques were randomly assigned (n = 10/group) to vehicle (control) or ptger2 antagonist (bay06) groups to perform a contraceptive trial. after the first treatment cycle, a male of proven fertility was introduced into each group and they remained housed together for the duration of the 5-month contraceptive trial that was followed by a post-treatment reversibility trial. quantitative real-time pcr, coc culture and expansion, immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy, enzyme immunoassay, contraceptive trial, ultrasonography, complete blood counts, serum biochemistry tests and blood lipid profiles. several mrnas encoding proteins involved in pge2 synthesis, metabolism and signaling increase (p < 0.05) in the periovulatory follicle after administration of an ovulatory hcg bolus. pge2 signaling through ptger2 induces cumulus cell expansion and production of hyaluronic acid, which are critical events for fertilization. moreover, chronic administration of a selective ptger2 antagonist resulted in a significant (p < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated controls) contraceptive effect without altering steroid hormone patterns or menstrual cyclicity during a 5-months contraceptive trial. fertility recovered as early as 1 month after ending treatment. this is a proof-of-concept study in a non-human primate model. further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanism(s) of ptger2 antagonist action in the primate ovary. although ptger2 antagonist treatment did not produce any obvious undesirable effects, improvements in the mode of administration, as well as the efficacy of these compounds, are necessary to consider such a contraceptive for women. monitoring as well as improving the efficacy and safety of female contraceptives is an important public health activity. even though hormonal contraceptives are effective for women, concerns remain regarding their side-effects and long-term use because of the widespread actions of such steroidal products in many tissues. moreover, some women cannot take hormones for medical reasons. thus, development of non-hormonal contraceptives for women is warranted. supported by bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals, the eunice kennedy shriver nichd contraceptive development and research center (u54 hd055744), nih office of the director (oregon national primate research center p51 od011092), and a lalor foundation postdoctoral basic research fellowship (mcp). the use of the leica confocal was supported by grant number s10rr024585. some of the authors (n.b., a.r., k.-h.f., u.f., b.b. and b.l.) are employees of bayer healthcare pharma.
emergency_contraception	this paper presents the public health rationale for multipurpose prevention technologies (mpts) for sexual and reproductive health (srh) based on regional trends in demographic and srh indicators. it then distils important lessons gleaned from the introduction of contraceptive and reproductive health products over the past several decades in order to inform the development and future introduction of mpts for srh. principal results: a comparison of current demographic and public health regional data clearly revealed that the greatest confluence of women 's srh concerns occurs in sub-saharan africa and south/west asia. these regional overlaps of srh risks and outcomes present a strong rationale for developing mpts designed to simultaneously protect against unintended pregnancy, hiv and other stis. information from acceptability, marketing, and operations research on the female condom, emergency contraception, pills and intravaginal rings identified key product characteristics and socio-behavioral issues to be considered in the development and introduction of mpts. product characteristics such as formulation, duration of action, presence and magnitude of side effects, prescription status (over-the-counter vs. prescribed), provider type and training and user perspectives, all contributed in varying degrees to both provider and user bias, and subsequent uptake of these family planning methods. underlying socio-behavioral issues, including risk perception, ambivalence, and social costs also contributed to demand and use. early identification of target populations will be critical to market shaping, demand creation and defining appropriate service delivery channels for mpts. ultimately, knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices of users (and their partners) will drive the success-or failure-of product introduction. conclusions: mpts provide a compelling response to the multiple and reinforcing srh risks faced by women in key regions of the world, but specific product characteristics and their socio-behavioral correlates must be taken into account early in the development process. successful introduction of new mpts will require solid understanding of socio-behavioral correlates, effective demand generation, appropriate integration into health service delivery systems, quality counseling for proper use and active engagement of both public and private sectors. this article is based on a presentation at the ""product development workshop 2013: hiv and multipurpose prevention technologies,"" held in arlington, virginia on february 21-22, 2013. it forms part of a special supplement to antiviral research.

emergency_contraception	objectives this paper highlights lessons from introductory efforts and presents new data on community, provider and key opinion leader perspectives to support expanded use of emergency contraception (ec) in senegal. sources of information the paper draws on four data sources: (i) a literature review; (ii) a secondary analysis of a household survey conducted by the urban reproductive health initiative; (iii) in-depth interviews with key opinion leaders; and (iv) a quantitative survey of healthcare providers from a range of service delivery points. analysis of data knowledge of ec among women is low in urban areas, with only 20% of women having heard of the method and 4% having ever used it. there were serious gaps in providers' technical knowledge about ec; only 57% knew its mode of action and 34% were aware of the need for timely use (within 120 h). moreover, nearly half reported reluctance to provide ec to married women and even fewer were willing to provide it to youths, particularly to adolescent girls. responses from key opinion leaders were mixed, demonstrating ambivalence about ec and how it could be offered. conclusion in senegal, the current positive political climate for family planning provides a good opportunity for strengthening ec programming to address knowledge and attitudinal barriers among providers, key opinion leaders and communities.
emergency_contraception	background: health service providers can restrict access to contraceptives through their own imposed biases about method appropriateness. in this study, provider biases toward contraceptive service provision among urban nigerian providers was assessed. methods: health providers working in health facilities, as well as pharmacists and patent medical vendors (pmv), in abuja, benin city, ibadan, ilorin, kaduna, and zaria, were surveyed in 2011 concerning their self-reported biases in service provision based on age, parity, and marital status. results: minimum age bias was the most common bias while minimum parity was the least common bias reported by providers. condoms were consistently provided with the least amount of bias, followed by provision of emergency contraception (ec), pills, injectables, and iuds. experience of in-service training for health facility providers was associated with decreased prevalence of marital status bias for the pill, injectable, and iud; however, training experience did not, or had the opposite effect on, pharmacists and pmv operator 's reports of service provision bias. conclusions: provider imposed eligibility barriers in urban study sites in nigeria were pervasive - the most prevalent restriction across method and provider type was minimum age. given the large and growing adolescent population interventions aimed at increasing supportive provision of contraceptives to youth in this context are urgently needed. the results show that the effect of in-service training on provider biases was limited. future efforts to address provider biases in contraceptive service provision, among all provider types, must find creative ways to address this critical barrier to increased contraceptive use.
skin_care	job-related hand dermatitis heads up the list of reported occupational diseases. so-called skin products - understood to mean protective creams, skin cleansers and skin care products - are used for the primary and secondary prevention of job-related hand dermatitis. in the interests of evidence-based medicine, the only preventive measures and/or occupational skin products that should be used are those whose potential uses and efficacy are underpinned by scientific research. to this end, the arbeitsgemeinschaft fur berufs-und umweltdermatologie e. v. (working group for occupational and environmental dermatology, abd) of the ddg (german dermatological society) and the deutsche gesellschaft fur arbeits - und umweltmedizin (german society for occupational and environmental medicine, dgaum) have summed up the latest scientific findings and recommendations in the updated guideline. the benefit of the combined application of protective creams and skin care products in the primary and secondary prevention of work-related contact dermatitis has been widely confirmed by recent clinical-epidemiological studies. the guideline clearly explains the necessity of demonstrating the efficacy of protective creams and cleansing products by means of in vivo methods in the sense of repetitive applications. transferable standardised testing systems designed to examine the irritation potential and thus the compatibility of occupational skin cleansers and the reduction of irritation by protective skin creams have now been developed and validated by multicentre studies for skin protection creams and cleansers. the status of the current assessment of the safety of occupational skin products is also summarised.
skin_care	objective: we assessed the knowledge level and skills of trained ashas in providing home-based newborn care. methods: 100 asha from two talukas of anand district of gujarat participated. knowledge was assessed using a structured questionnaire while certain skills were assessed through direct observation on mannequins. results: the mean (sd) knowledge score of the participants was 16.7(3.16) out of 34. the skills were satisfactory in 52%, 61%, 43%, and 68% of asha workers for temperature measurement, hand washing, weight measurement and skin-to-skin care, respectively. large variability was observed in self reported and field performance of asha workers. conclusions: knowledge and skills of asha workers in this region were inadequate.
skin_care	background: skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant, commonly referred to as kangaroo care (kc), has demonstrated efficacy as a pain-relieving strategy for infants, yet, it remains underutilized in clinical practice. purpose: to evaluate changes in neonatal intensive care unit staff nurse beliefs, utilization, and challenges related to practice change in implementing kc as an intervention for management of procedural pain in preterm infants between 2 time points. methods: nurses who participated in a larger clinical trial examining the sustained efficacy of kc were asked to complete a questionnaire at 2 time points: 1-and 6 month(s) following study initiation. identified benefits, expectations, frequency of use, and challenges related to practice change uptake were described using frequencies and percentages. data from the 2 different time points were compared using. 2 analysis. results: of the 40 nurses approached, all completed the questionnaire (19 at the 1-month and 21 at the 6-month time point). of the sample (n = 40), 97% of participants indicated that they expected kc to provide good pain relief or better. staff nurses reported significantly improved preconceived ideas (chi(2) = 22.68, p <.01) and significantly fewer concerns (chi(2) = 22.10, p =.01) related to using kc as a pain-relieving intervention between the 2 time points. no significant differences were seen in the frequency of using kc as an intervention between time points. implications for research and practice: despite increasingly positive preconceived ideas and reduced concerns, the frequency of using kc for procedural pain relief remained unchanged. further research addressing ways to overcome barriers to utilizing kc as an intervention for procedural pain is warranted.
skin_care	background: the period of infancy, spanning through the neonatal stage to two years, is characterized by a series of health challenges for the affected child and concerned parents. this study conducted in odeda local government area of ogun state, nigeria was aimed at investigating the plants used in the traditional management of infantile dermatitis and other neonatal skin infections with emphasis on the role of spices. methods: structured questionnaires (and personal interview) were administered to 36 nursing mothers (age range, 15 - 50) and 30 herbsellers (age range, 21 - 60) in the lga. the herbsellers prescribed recipes used in the management of general skin diseases including abscess, chicken pox, eczema, flaky skin spots, measles, rashes, ringworm, and small pox. results: the survey yielded 69 plants belonging to 38 families and forming 25 polyherbal and mono-recipes. fabaceae, rutaceae, euphorbiaceae, annonaceae, poaceae, meliaceae, and amaryllidaceae had high species representation. trees (40.58%) were the most frequently used plant habit while leaves (40.58%) formed the most frequently used plant part. decoction and infusion using pure water were the methods of preparation suggested. administration ranged from drinking extracts (2-3 teaspoonfuls) three times daily, to bathing with warm extracts of the plants and the use of coconut oil as cream. traditional black soap and shea butter also featured in the herbal remedy for bath and as cream respectively. local sponge was preferred for bathing. conclusion: this study has documented the alternative medical approach in the management of infantile skin diseases. the cultural relevance of plants calls for sustainable use of plant resources. this research finds application in primary health care, microbiology, and in cosmetic industries for the development of new or improved baby skin care products. further research should be conducted to confirm the claimed ethnomedicinal values as well as evaluate possible harm of crude plant extracts to skin structures of infants.
skin_care	nowadays, the consumers around the world are increasingly focused on health and beauty. the renewed consumer interest in natural cosmetic products creates the demand for new products and reformulated others with botanical and functional ingredients. in cosmetic products, essential oils (eos) play a major role as fragrance ingredients. they can optimize its proprieties and preservation, as well as the marketing image of the final product. microencapsulation of eos can protect and prevent the loss of volatile aromatic ingredients and improve the controlled release and stability of this core materials. the importance of eos for cosmetic industry and its microencapsulation was reviewed in this study. also a briefly introduction about the preparation of microparticles was presented. some of the most important and usual microencapsulation techniques of eos, as well as the conventional encapsulating agents, were discussed. despite the fact that microencapsulation of eos is a very promising and extremely attractive application area for cosmetic industry, further basic research needs to be carried out, for a better understanding of the biofunctional activities of microencapsulated eos and its release modulation, as well as the effects of others cosmetic ingredients and the storage time in the microparticles properties.
myelofibrosis	backgroundthis analysis of the myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn) landmark survey evaluated gaps between patient perceptions of their disease management and physician self-reported practices. methodsthe survey included 813 patient respondents who had mpns (myelofibrosis [mf], polycythemia vera [pv], or essential thrombocythemia [et]) and 457 hematologist/oncologist respondents who treated patients with these conditions. resultsgreater proportions of physician respondents reported using prognostic risk classifications (mf, 83%; pv, 59%; et, 77%) compared with patient recollections (mf, 54%; pv, 17%; et, 31%). most physician respondents reported that their typical symptom assessments included asking patients about the most important symptoms or a full list of symptoms, whereas many patient respondents reported less specific assessments (eg, they were asked how they were feeling). many patient respondents did not recognize common symptoms as mpn-related. for example, approximately one-half or more did not believe difficulty sleeping resulted from their mpn (mf, 49%; pv, 64%; et, 76%). physician respondents underestimated the proportion of patients who had symptomatic pv or et at diagnosis compared with patient respondents. there was discordance regarding treatment goals: among patient respondents with mf or pv, slow/delay progression of condition was the most important treatment goal, whereas physician respondents reported symptom improvement and prevention of vascular/thrombotic events, respectively. finally, more than one-third of patient respondents were not very satisfied with their physician 's overall management/communication. conclusionsthe care and satisfaction of patients with mpn may be improved with increased patient education and improved patient-physician communication. cancer 2017;123:449-458. (c) 2016 the authors. cancer published by wiley periodicals, inc. on behalf of american cancer society. this analysis of data from the myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn) landmark survey identified important gaps in patient and physician respondent perceptions about mpns. discordance in patient and physician respondent perceptions was observed in mpn-related prognostic risk assessment, symptom burden, treatment goals and expectations, and treatment satisfaction.
myelofibrosis	identification of somatic frameshift mutations in exon 9 of the calreticulin gene (calr) in myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) in december of 2013 has been a remarkable finding. it has provided a new molecular diagnostic marker, particularly in essential thrombocythemia (et) and primary myelofibrosis (pmf), where is the second most common altered gene after jak2v617f. there are two main types of calr mutants, type 1 and type 2, and there is evidence about their distinct clinical/prognostic implications, for instances, it is believed that favorable outcome might be restricted to type-1 in pmf. by using reasoned approaches, very recent publications have supported classifying the alternative mutants in type-1-like or type-2-like. if further studies confirm these results, new considerations may be taken into account in the molecular diagnosis of mpns. this implies that precise mutation characterization must be performed and caution should be taken in screening technique selection. in this editorial we summarize the current information regarding all this issues.
myelofibrosis	background true essential thrombocythemia (et) may carry one of the known driver mutations (jak2, mpl and calr) or none of them [in triple-negative (3neg) cases]. the patients' mutational status seems to delineate the clinical manifestations of et. materials and methods we report the data of 183 patients diagnosed with et strictly according to the who 2008 criteria and with a full molecular diagnosis, including the following: 114 patients (62.3%) with jak2v617f; 25 (13.7%) with calr type 1 and 19 (10.4%) with calr type 2; 3 (1.6%) with mpl; 22 (12%) who were 3neg. thrombotic risk was assessed by means of the ipset-thrombosis score (ipset-t). results calr and 3neg patients had lower haemoglobin levels and leucocyte count than jak2 patients. calr patients, and those with type 2 in particular, had higher mean platelet counts and had extreme thrombocytosis more often than any of the other groups. based on their ipset-t stratification, 3neg- and calr-mutated patients belonged more frequently to the low-risk group and had a significant more favourable thrombosis-free survival rate than those with jak2 mutation. conclusion these findings indicate that the three different molecular markers have a significant impact on the clinical course of true et, giving rise to different phenotypes of the same disease.
myelofibrosis	in this study, we investigate if chronic inflammation and autoimmunity might be related to the development of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml). conducting a case-control study, we included 112 cmml subjects diagnosed at three hematological departments in denmark between 2003 and 2013. controls were 231 unmatched chronic lymphatic leukemia (cll) subjects diagnosed at one of the departments between 2003 and 2012. subjects with a history of chronic inflammation or autoimmune disorders were retrieved and odds ratios (ors) calculated. 16.1% of cmml subjects and 6.5% of cll subjects presented with a history of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. this was significantly associated with an increased risk of cmml (adjusted or 3.24, 95% ci: 1.5-7.0). at individual levels, this association was statistically significant for polymyalgia rheumatica and itp (p values < 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). we found an association of cmml and smoking status (or 1.42, 95% ci: 1.06-1.90) with more former smokers in the cmml group.
myelofibrosis	essential thrombocythemia (et) is a rare clonal myeloproliferative disorder with a prevalence rate of approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 individuals per year. et is characterized by a persistent increase in the platelet count with hyperplasia of bone marrow megakaryocytes. it is difficult to make a diagnosis of et, because most thrombocythemia are reactive to certain disease conditions including iron deficiency anemia, infection, collagen diseases and malignant tumors. mutation in the janus kinase (jak)2 gene is present in approximately 50-70% of et patients, and somatic mutations in the calreticulin (calr) gene were recently discovered in approximately 20-25% of sporadic patients with et or primary myelofibrosis. various cutaneous manifestations of et often occur by microvascular thrombosis and precede severe arterial and venous thromboembolic events in other organs. therefore, in order to prevent such severe events, it is important to make an early diagnosis of et based on a number of cutaneous manifestations. here, we report two cases of et diagnosed based on livedo racemosa on feet with gene mutations in jak2 and calr, respectively, and show the pathological and immunohistological findings of the livedo resulting from platelet thrombosis rather than vasculitis. we also review the cutaneous manifestations in current published reports of japanese et patients. our patients were successfully treated with low-dose aspirin, a vasodepressor and hydroxyurea, following regressed livedo and reduced platelet counts.
hypothyroidism	thyroid hormones have an influence on the functioning of the central nervous system. furthermore, the cholinergic and purinergic systems also are extensively involved in brain function. in this context, quercetin is a polyphenol with antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. this study investigated the effects of (mmi)-induced hypothyroidism on the ntpdase, 5'-nucleotidase, adenosine deaminase (ada), and acetylcholinesterase (ache) activities in synaptosomes of rats and whether the quercetin can prevent it. mmi at a concentration of 20 mg/100 ml was administered for 90 days in the drinking water. the animals were divided into six groups: control/water (ct/w), control/quercetin 10 mg/kg, control/quercetin 25 mg/kg, methimazole/water (mmi/w), methimazole/quercetin 10 mg/kg (mmi/q10), and methimazole/quercetin 25 mg/kg (mmi/q25). on the 30th day, hormonal dosing was performed to confirm hypothyroidism, and the animals were subsequently treated with 10 or 25 mg/kg quercetin for 60 days. ntpdase activity was not altered in the mmi/w group. however, treatment with quercetin decreased atp and adp hydrolysis in the mmi/q10 and mmi/q25 groups. 5'-nucleotidase activity increased in the mmi/w group, but treatments with 10 or 25 mg/kg quercetin decreased 5'-nucleotidase activity. ada activity decreased in the ct/25 and mmi/q25 groups. furthermore, ache activity was reduced in all groups with hypothyroidism. in vitro tests also demonstrated that quercetin per se decreased ntpdase, 5'-nucleotidase, and ache activities. this study demonstrated changes in the 5'-nucleotidase and ache activities indicating that purinergic and cholinergic neurotransmission are altered in this condition. in addition, quercetin can alter these parameters and may be a promising natural compound with important neuroprotective actions in hypothyroidism.
hypothyroidism	background: autoimmune gastritis (aig) is a gastric pathologic condition affecting the mucosa of the fundus and the body and eventually leading to hypo-achlorhydria.aims: we report our clinical and pathological experience with aig.methods: data from patients with a diagnosis of aig seen in the period january 2002-december 2012 were retrieved. only patients with complete sets of biopsies were analyzed.results: data from 138 patients were available for analysis. pernicious anemia was present in 25% of patients, iron deficiency anemia was found in 29.7% of patients, hypothyroidism in 23% of patients, type 1 diabetes in 7.9% of patients, and vitiligo in 2.8% of patients. parietal cell antibodies were positive in 65% of patients, and no patient had serology positive for celiac disease. all gastric biopsies showed glandular atrophy associated with enterochromaffin-like (ecl)-cells hyperplasia, features limited to the mucosa of the fundus and body, and focal glandular intestinal metaplasia. helicobacter pylori was negative in all cases.conclusions: aig was strongly associated with anemia; atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and ecl hyperplasia in the gastric fundus and body are hallmarks of this condition.
hypothyroidism	the aim was to assess the proportion of women requiring a referral to an endocrinologist when carrying out routine screening for maternal thyroid disease simultaneously with screening for down syndrome. between november 2009 and september 2015, women having a first trimester combined test were screened; those symptomatic or being investigated for thyroid problems were excluded. in the first half of the period the blood sample was tested for anti-thyroid peroxidase (tpo) antibodies, serum thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh), and free thyroxine (ft4); thereafter ft4 was not used. women with at least one analyte outside the range (tpo more than 5.6 ku/l, tsh 0.35-4.94 mu/l, ft4 9.0-19.1 pml/l) were referred to an endocrinologist for counseling. of 10,052 women screened, 1190 (11.8%) had tsh, ft4, or antibody levels outside the range; 13.0% when ft4 was used and 10.4% thereafter. most of these positive results were due to a single abnormal marker. there was a much higher positive rate in multiple pregnancies (27.3% compared with 11.5% in singletons; p < 0.0001). there was an association between positivity and maternal age (p < 0.0001), a higher rate in the small ethnic group of asians (p < 0.0005) and a lower rate among smokers (p < 0.02) and following assisted reproduction (p < 0.05). routine antibody and hormone testing at the same time as the combined test generated a large number of referrals but this did not overload the services.
hypothyroidism	accumulating evidences showed that thyroid hormone was participated in the functioning of the reproductive system, and an elevated level of thyroid hormones had a negative impact on reproductive system. however, the molecular basis for this observation still remains to be fully understood. here, we show that l-thyroxine significantly impaired human sperm motility. the molecular basis showed that thyroxine receptor stimulation triggers phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt signaling activation leading to the e3 ligase mdm2 phosphorylation at serine 166, which directly interacted with p53 for degradation. p53 degradation caused a p53-dependent dna damage checkpoint or repair dysfunction, which eventually results in dna damage accumulation in sperm. our results highlight that inhibition of pi3k/akt pathway or p53 degradation is important in maintaining sperm motility in a thyroxine receptor (tr)-dependent manner.

hypothyroidism	background: thyroid hormone concentrations may deviate from normal values during critical illness. this condition is known as nonthyroidal illness syndrome (ntis), and it can influence the results of screening for congenital hypothyroidism (ch) during neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo). objectives: to determine the incidence of aberrant ch screening results in ecmo-treated neonates, to identify possible determinants, and to follow up patients with abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations. methods: in this retrospective cohort study, we included 168 ecmo-treated neonates admitted from 2004 to 2014 and screened by protocol and divided them into the following 3 groups: group 1 (screened during ecmo, n = 107), group 2 (screened shortly before ecmo, n = 26), and group 3 (screened shortly after ecmo, n = 35). results: ch screening results were aberrant in 67.3% (72/107) of the neonates screened during ecmo, in 73.1% (19/26) of the neonates screened before ecmo, and in 31.4% (11/35) of the neonates screened after ecmo (p < 0.001). of the neonates with an aberrant screening result, all but 2 (i.e. 98%) had a low thyroxine concentration with a normal thyrotropin concentration at screening, as is seen in ntis. none was diagnosed with ch. mortality did not significantly differ between neonates with an aberrant screening result (32.4%) and neonates with a normal screening result (22.7%; p = 0.18). screening before ecmo (or 5.92; 95% c11.93-18.20), screening during ecmo (or 4.49; 95% ci 1.98-10.19), and a higher pediatric logistic organ dysfunction-2 score (or 1.31; 95% ci 1.04-1.66) were associated with an aberrant screening result. conclusions: aberrant ch screening results were found in most ecmo-treated neonates screened before or during ecmo, which is likely due to ntis. follow-up of thyroid hormone concentrations is best started after recovery from critical illness. our results suggest that thyroxine therapy is not required during ecmo.

headache	daclatasvir (dcv) is a potent, pangenotypic, hepatitis c virus (hcv) non-structural protein 5a inhibitor with low potential for drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy (art). we evaluated the safety and efficacy of dcv plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin (pegifn/rbv) in hiv-1/hcv genotype-1-coinfected patients. ai444043 (nct01471574), an open-label, phase iii, single-arm, response-guided treatment (rgt) study included 301 patients. they received dcv doses of 30, 60 or 90 mg once daily (depending on concomitant art), plus weight-based rbv (< 75 kg, 1000 mg/day; or ae75 kg, 1200 mg/day), and once-weekly pegifn 180 mu g, for 24 weeks. if required by rgt, pegifn/rbv without dcv was extended for an additional 24 weeks of therapy. the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (svr12). overall, 224 (74%) patients achieved svr12 and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was higher than the historic svr rate with pegifn/rbv alone (70 vs. 29%). most common adverse events (aes) were fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, asthenia and headache. on-treatment serious aes occurred in 24/301 (8%) patients; 18/301 (6%) discontinued treatment due to ae. dcv + pegifn/rbv led to sustained hcv virologic response in the majority of hiv-1-hcv-coinfected patients, regardless of concomitant art. hiv control was not compromised and no new safety signals were identified. this study supports dcv use in hiv-1-hcv-coinfected patients, while allowing the vast majority of patients to remain on their existing art regimen.
headache	background: vestibular rehabilitation is the most effective treatment for dizziness due to vestibular dysfunction. given the biological relationship between vestibular symptoms and headache, headache in patients with vestibular migraine (vm) could be improved by vestibular rehabilitation that leads to the improvement of dizziness. this study aimed to compare the effects of vestibular rehabilitation on headache and other outcomes relating to dizziness, and the psychological factors in patients with vm patients, patients with dizziness and tension-type headache, and patients without headache. methods: our participants included 251 patients with dizziness comprising 28 patients with vm, 79 patients with tension-type headache, and 144 patients without headache. participants were hospitalized for 5 days and taught to conduct a vestibular rehabilitation program. they were assessed using the dizziness handicap inventory (dhi), headache impact test (hit-6), hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), and somatosensory catastrophizing scale (sscs) and underwent center of gravity fluctuation measurement as an objective dizziness severity index before, 1 month after, and 4 months after their hospitalization. results: the vm and tension-type headache groups demonstrated a significant improvement in the hit-6 score with improvement of the dhi, hads, sscs, and a part of the objective dizziness index that also shown in patients without headache following vestibular rehabilitation. the change in hit-6 during rehabilitation in the vm group was positively correlated with changes in the dhi and anxiety in the hads. changes in the hit-6 in tension-type headache group positively correlated with changes in anxiety and sscs. conclusion: vestibular rehabilitation contributed to improvement of headache both in patients with vm and patients with dizziness and tension-type headache, in addition to improvement of dizziness and psychological factors. improvement in dizziness following vestibular rehabilitation could be associated with the improvement of headache more prominently in vm compared with comorbid tension-type headache.
headache	background: benign episodic unilateral mydriasis is one cause of anisocoria. this phenomenon is thought to be related to an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. there is a documented association with migraines, but asymptomatic cases have also been reported. a challenge with all cases is the level of investigation required to exclude more sinister causes of nervous system dysfunction. in a dynamic flight environment, additional considerations need to be made, such as varying light levels and use of night vision devices. case report: a 27-yr-old woman on deployment to afghanistan as a flight nurse presented to the role one clinic with right-sided mydriasis.the patient denied headache or any history of migraines. a dilated right pupil that was reactive to light was found on exam. symptoms and exam findings resolved shortly after initial presentation. we consulted an ophthalmologist who requested patient transfer for review. he made a diagnosis of benign episodic unilateral mydriasis. discussion: there are a variety of causes for anisocoria. a thorough history and examination are required to avoid unnecessary investigations that may not be locally available in the more austere deployed military settings. from an operational perspective, the decision needs to be made regarding the maintenance of flight status. consideration needs to be given to patient care capability when treating a flight nurse. in cases of rapid resolution such as this, removal from operational status is not reasonable should a clinician be confident of the diagnosis.
headache	anterior inferior cerebellar artery (aica) aneurysms are extremely rare, accounting for only 0.75% of all intracranial aneurysms. the average age of patients suffering from those aneurysms found in the literature was 44 years, with no significant difference between the sexes. these aneurysms can manifest clinically through expansive symptoms in cerebellopontine angle or through signs and symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, nystagmus and paresis. the gold standard exam for diagnosis is cerebral angiography. the treatment of these lesions is controversial. the main difficulty of the surgical treatment of these aneurysms is the location of the aica, which lies close to critical neurovascular structures. in this article, we describe a proximal aica aneurysm embolization without occlusion of the parent artery, with excellent results in the postoperative period.
headache	objectiveto determine whether baseline nausea or prior triptan treatment for migraine impact the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in treating acute migraine. backgrounda great deal of variability exists in patients' response to migraine medications. migraine-associated nausea is common and debilitating and can reduce the effectiveness of oral medications. it may cause patients to delay taking oral medications, which is known to diminish therapeutic outcomes, or to avoid taking them altogether. gastroparesis, which may be associated with nausea, also inhibits drug absorption, resulting in lower bioavailability. studies have shown that having nausea at the time of drug administration predicts a poorer response to triptan treatment. it is of interest to understand how effective other migraine medications are in patients with a poor response to triptans. methodsdata from two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials were pooled and post hoc subgroup analyses were performed in patients with and without nausea at baseline, and in patients with and without prior triptan treatment. efficacy assessments included the percentage of patients who, at 2 hours postdosing, were headache pain-free (2hpf, primary endpoint), without photophobia, without phonophobia, without nausea, or without a severe degree of disability. a cochran-mantel-haenszel test, stratified by analysis center was used to evaluate treatment effect. effects of nausea or prior triptan use were determined using logistic regression with factors of treatment group, analysis center, nausea or prior triptan use at time of dosing, and interaction of treatment group by nausea or prior triptan use at time of dosing. resultsthe modified intent to treat population consisted of 1272 patients, 644 on active drug and 628 on placebo. the majority of patients (85%) were female. at the time of dosing, 783 (62%) patients reported nausea with the treated attack. prior triptan use was recorded in 570 (45%). for headache pain, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, patients in the active treatment group had a statistically significantly better response than those receiving placebo, regardless of whether they had nausea at baseline. in logistic regression analysis only treatment group predicted a response for these parameters with no detectable group interaction. baseline nausea, as well as treatment group, predicted whether patients recorded severe disability at 2 hours. while patients in the active treatment group were significantly more likely to be headache pain-free at 2 hours after dosing, whether or not they had previously been treated with triptan, more triptan-naive patients (30%) than triptan-experienced patients (20%) were headache pain-free. interestingly, in the placebo groups, triptan-naive patients were also more likely to be pf (14% vs 7%). in the logistic regression analysis, treatment group predicted a headache pain response, triptan use predicted a lack of response, and there was no interaction between the two. prior triptan use did not predict any of the other outcome measures. conclusionsnausea at the time of dosing does not diminish the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium for oral solution. the rapid absorption profile may enhance the effectiveness in patients with nausea. prior triptan use predicted poorer headache response at 2 hours postdose, suggesting the possibility of a subset of patients who are more likely to be refractory to both triptans and diclofenac. diclofenac potassium for oral solution is effective in triptan-naive patients but no reliable inference can be made from this study as to about how to order treatment.
overactive_bladder	this study was conducted in order to determine the effect of the presence of urinary incontinence on sexual quality of life in women diagnosed with chronic physical diseases. the sample of the cross sectional and comparative study consisted of 67.5 % (n = 191) female inpatients with and 32.5 % (n = 92) female inpatients without urinary incontinence complaints being treated for chronic physical diseases in the internal diseases clinic of a public hospital. data was collected using the patient identification form, the international incontinence consultation questionnaire-short form and the sexual quality of life scale for women. the average score that women with urinary incontinence took from the sexual quality of life scale (61.50 +/- 19.10) was lower than the average score of women without urinary incontinence (77.19 +/- 18.75) (p < 0.01). there was a negative meaningful relationship between the frequency, amount, and effect of urinary incontinence and sexual quality of life (p < 0.05). the sexual quality of life of women who were 50 years of age and above, who had respiratory system diseases, had a duration of illness between 6 and 10 years, perceived their general health as bad, parity and gave normal birth, were in their menopausal period, and had hysterectomies was significantly lower (p < 0.05). as a result, in women with chronic physical diseases and urinary incontinence, the sexual quality of life is affected in a worse level compared to those who do not have urinary incontinence.
overactive_bladder	background: treatment of urgency urinary incontinence has focused on pharmacologically treating detrusor overactivity. recent recognition that altered perception of internal stimuli (interoception) plays a role in urgency urinary incontinence suggests that exploration of abnormalities of brain function in this disorder could lead to better understanding of urgency incontinence and its treatment. objective: we sought to: (1) evaluate the relationship between bladder filling, perceived urgency, and activation at brain sites within the interoceptive network in urgency urinary incontinence; (2) identify coactivation of other brain networks that could affect interoception during bladder filling in urgency incontinence; and (3) demonstrate interaction between these sites prior to bladder filling by evaluating their resting-state connectivity. study design: we performed an observational cohort study using functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain function in 53 women with urgency urinary incontinence and 20 controls. whole-brain voxelwise analyses of covariance were performed to examine differences in functional brain activation between groups during a task consisting of bladder filling, hold (static volume), and withdrawal phases. the task was performed at 3 previously established levels of baseline bladder volume, the highest exceeding strong desire to void volume. all women continuously rated their urge on a 0- to 10-point likert scale throughout the task and a mixed measures analysis of variance was used to test for differences in urge ratings. empirically derived regions of interest from analysis of activation during the task were used as seeds for examining group differences in resting-state functional connectivity. results: in both urgency urinary incontinent participants and controls, changes in urge ratings were greatest during bladder filling initiated from a high baseline bladder volume and urgency incontinent participants' rating changes were greater than controls. during this bladder-filling phase urgency incontinent participant 's activation of the interoceptive network was greater than controls, including in the left insula and the anterior and middle cingulate cortex. urgency incontinent participant 's activation was also greater than controls at sites in the ventral attention network and posterior default mode network. urgency incontinent participant 's connectivity was greater than controls between a middle cingulate seed point and the dorsal attention network, a ""top-down"" attentional network. control connectivity was greater between the midcingulate seed point and the ventral attention network, a ""bottom-up"" attentional network. conclusion: increasing urge was associated with greater urgency incontinent participant than control activation of the interoceptive network and activation in networks that are determinants of self-awareness (default mode network) and of response to unexpected external stimuli (ventral attention network). differences in connectivity between interoceptive networks and opposing attentional networks (ventral attention network vs dorsal attention network) were present even before bladder filling (in the resting state). these findings are strong evidence for a central nervous system component of urgency urinary incontinence that could be mediated by brain-directed therapies.
overactive_bladder	purpose: we investigated the efficacy of 2 alpha 1-blockers with different affinities for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes silodosin and naftopidil in the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement complicated by overactive bladder. materials and methods: this was a prospective, open label, randomized, multicenter study of 350 outpatients with untreated benign prostatic enlargement associated with urinary urgency at least once per week and an oabss (overactive bladder symptom score) of 3 or greater. patients were randomly assigned to receive silodosin 8 mg per day or naftopidil 75 mg per day. changes in parameters from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks were assessed based on i-pss (international prostate symptom score), i-pss quality of life, oabss and voiding functions measured by uroflowmetry. results: on efficacy analysis a total of 314 patients were included in the 2 groups. no significant difference in adverse effects was observed between the groups. mean i-pss and i-pss quality of life scores, and oabss significantly improved in both groups. statistically significantly greater improvement in the silodosin group than in the naftopidil group was observed in total oabss (p = 0.03), i-pss quality of life score (p = 0.005) and oabss urgency score (pa-adrenoceptor blocker.
overactive_bladder	aimcentral efferent and afferent neural pathways to and from the human urinary bladder are well-characterized, but the location and arborization of these nerves as they traverse the serosa, muscularis, and urothelial layers are not clearly defined. the purpose of this study was to create a three dimensional map of the innervation of the human bladder trigone from the extrinsic perivesical adventitial nerve trunks to the urothelium. methodsa male and a female human bladder were harvested from fresh frozen cadavers and fixed in formalin. the bladder neck and trigone region were serially sectioned (5m) and every 20th slide was stained (s100), scanned and aligned to create 3d maps. resultsnerve penetration into the detrusor muscle occurs with the highest frequency at the bladder neck and interureteric ridge. nerves traveling parallel to the bladder lumen do so in the adventitia, beyond the outer border of detrusor. in females, the depth of these nerve bands is uniform at 0.7-1.7cm below the luminal surface, the outer limits of which include the anterior vaginal wall. in the male, depth is more variable owing to detrusor hypertrophy with the minimum depth of nerves approximately 0.5cm near the interureteric ridge and over 1cm near the bladder neck. conclusionsmyelinated neural pathways traversing in the human bladder in the region of the trigone have a discreet regional density. this 3d map of trigonal innervation may provide guidance to more precisely direct therapies for urinary incontinence or pelvic pain. neurourol. urodynam. 36:1015-1019, 2017.

overactive_bladder	purpose: to evaluate the relationship between prostatic vessel changes induced by cigarette smoking and the perioperative outcome of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (holep). materials and methods: a total of 268 postoperative patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) were prospectively analysed in our department. they were divided into two groups (smokers and non-smokers) according to smoking history. transrectal colour doppler ultrasound was performed to evaluate the prostate vascular changes. pathologically, he staining, cd31 and cd34 were analysed in prostatic section chips. furthermore, postoperative outcomes were determined during a 6-month follow-up period. results: the preoperative prostate volume was significantly decreased in smoking patients (p = 0.04). cpi was significantly lower in smoking bph patients (p < 0.01), whereas ri was significantly increased in smokers compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.01). histological assays revealed elevated cd34 in the smoking bph individuals presenting an increased number of microvessels. the holep duration was increased in smokers. interestingly, we identified significantly increased overactive bladder syndrome score (oabss) and decreased qmax in smoking individuals during the 6-month follow-up with no difference being observed preoperatively. however, no significant difference between the groups was observed for the international prostate symptom score (ipss). conclusions: the significantly lower cpi and higher ri values in smoking bph patients indicated the presence of considerable vascular damage in these subjects. moreover, cigarette smoking extended the surgical duration and prolonged the recovery period of overactive bladder (oab) syndrome. thus, integrated treatment should be suggested for various bph individuals.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	use of probiotic therapy is an active area of investigation to treat intestinal disorders. the clinical benefits of the i3.1 probiotic formula (lactobacillus plantarum (cect7484, cect7485) and p. acidilactici (cect7483)) were demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. the aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of i3.1 in two experimental models of colitis, a dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis model and an interleukin (il)-10-deficient mice model. colitis was induced in 32 8-week-old balb/c mice by administering 3% (w/v) dss in drinking water for 5 days. probiotics were administered orally (i3.1 or vsl#3, 1 x 109 cfu daily) for 10 days before the administration of dss. also, probiotics (i3.1 or vsl# 3, 1 x 109 cfu daily) were administered orally to 36 6-week-old c57b6j il-10(-/-) mice for 10 weeks. body weight was recorded daily. colon samples were harvested for histological examination and cytokine measurements. body weight after dss administration did not change in the i3.1 group, whereas the vsl#3 group had weight loss. also, i3.1 normalized il-6 to levels similar to that of healthy controls and significantly increased the reparative histologic score. in the il-10-deficient model, both vsl# 3 and i3.1 reduced the severity of colitis compared to untreated controls, and i3.1 significantly reduced the levels of ifn-gamma compared to the other two groups. in conclusion, i3.1 displays a protective effect on two murine models of experimental colitis. results suggest that the mechanism of action could be different from vsl#3.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	microscopic colitis is a generic term that includes 2 main forms, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, and describes a form of inflammatory bowel disease with a chronic and relapsing course. the incidence of microscopic colitis is between 2 and 8 times higher in women than in men, although age, more than sex, increases the risk of collagenous colitis (odds ratio [or] 8.3 for age >= 65 vs. <65 and or 2.8 for women). the main symptom is chronic non bloody watery diarrhoea. other common symptoms include abdominal pain (50%-70%), with the result that many patients with microscopic colitis meet criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. colonoscopy with multiple colonic biopsies is currently recommended, as histological changes are the main characteristic feature. the colonic mucosa is macroscopically normal, although certain minimal endoscopic abnormalities have been described.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	objectives: to compare cumulative ionizing radiation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) for the years 2001-2011. to study how radiation exposure change over time in patients with newly diagnosed ibd and factors associated with radiation exposure. material and methods: all radiological investigations performed between 1 january 2001 and 31 december 2011 were retrospectively recorded in patients with crohn 's disease (cd) (n=103), ulcerative colitis (uc) (n=304) and ibs (n=149). analyses were done with mann-whitney and chi-square test. results: the median total cumulative radiation exposure in msv for cd (20.0, inter quartile range (iqr) 34.8), uc (7.01, iqr 23.8), ibs (2.71, iqr 9.15) and the proportion of patients who had been exposed for more than 50 msv during the study period (cd 19%, uc 11%, ibs 3%) were significantly higher in the patients with cd compared to patients with uc (p<.001) and ibs (p<.001), respectively. in turn, patients with uc had significantly higher doses than patients with ibs (p=.005). risk factors for radiation exposure were female gender (cd), early onset (uc), ileocolonic location (cd), previous surgery (cd and uc), depression (ibs) and widespread pain (ibs). in newly diagnosed cd, there was a significant decline in median cumulative radiation dose in msv (17.2 vs. 12.0; p=.048) during the study period. conclusions: patients with cd are at greatest risk for high cumulative radiation exposure, but there is a decline in exposure during the late 2000s. non-colectomized patients with uc and patients with ibs have a relatively low risk of cumulative radiation exposure.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (asia) is an entity that includes different autoimmune conditions observed after exposure to an adjuvant. patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (uctd) present many signs and symptoms of asia, alluding to the idea that an exposure to adjuvants can be a trigger also for uctd. the aim of this case-control study was to investigate exposure to adjuvants prior to disease onset in patients affected by uctd. ninety-two uctd patients and 92 age- and sex-matched controls with no malignancy, chronic infections, autoimmune disease nor family history of autoimmune diseases were investigated for exposure to adjuvants. an ad hoc-created questionnaire exploring the exposure to vaccinations, foreign materials and environmental and occupational exposures was administered to both cases and controls. autoantibodies were also analyzed (anti-nuclear, anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-double-stranded dna, anti-cardiolipin, anti-beta 2 glycoprotein i). uctd patients displayed a greater exposure to hbv (p = 0.018) and tetanus toxoid (p < 0.001) vaccinations, metal implants (p < 0.001), cigarette smoking (p = 0.006) and pollution due to metallurgic factories and foundries (p = 0.048) as compared to controls. uctd patients exposed to major asia triggers (vaccinations, silicone implants) (n = 49) presented more frequently with chronic fatigue (p < 0.001), general weakness (p = 0.011), irritable bowel syndrome (p = 0.033) and a family history for autoimmunity (p = 0.018) in comparison to non-exposed uctds. asia and uctd can be considered as related entities in the ""mosaic of autoimmunity"": the genetic predisposition and the environmental exposure to adjuvants elicit a common clinical phenotype characterized by signs and symptoms of systemic autoimmunity.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objectives: the aim of the study was to systemically investigate the risk of subsequent irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) in children with antecedent allergic diseases in a population-based case-control study in taiwan. methods: we evaluated 11,242 children (age range: 7-18 years) with ibs and 44,968 age- and sex-matched control subjects who had been examined between 2000 and 2008. ibs odds ratios were calculated for children with antecedent allergic diseases, including allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and food allergy. results: children with antecedent allergic diseases had a greater risk of ibs than did control subjects (p < 0.001). among the 6 evaluated diseases, the highest adjusted odds ratio of 1.78 was observed with allergic rhinitis (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.69-1.87). with 2 or more allergic diseases, the adjusted odds ratios increased to 2.06 (95% ci, 1.93-2.19) for all subjects, 2.07 (95% ci, 1.88-2.28) for girls, and 2.18 (95% ci, 2.02-2.35) for children 12 years or older. conclusions: preschoolers with a history of allergic disease had an increased risk of subsequent ibs development upon reaching school age. this risk increased in the presence of concurrent allergic disease and a higher clinical allergy burden.
polycythemia_vera	red blood cells play a key role in normal hemostasis and thrombosis. their ability to affect coagulation is multifactorial and depends on their mechanical properties affecting viscosity and blood flow, ability to aggregate and adhere to each other and potentially to vascular endothelium, molecular signaling via microvesicles and surface proteins, including blood group antigens, and participation in nitric oxide metabolism. transfused red blood cells suffer from a storage lesion that damages the cells leading to changes in shape, function, and intracellular communication. in this article, we review if and how transfused red blood cells may lead to both increased hemorrhage and increased thrombosis.
polycythemia_vera	purpose of review venous thromboembolism is frequent in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn). the current strategy for its management includes cytoreductive therapy and antithrombotic prophylaxis, but many issues remain uncertain. in this review, the risk factors and prevention of recurrences will be discussed. recent findings around one-third of patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia experience a major thrombosis at diagnosis or during follow-up. according to the european leukemia net guidelines, these patients must be included in the high-risk group for thrombotic recurrence and should be treated with cytoreduction and antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs in the presence of arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. despite this treatment, the annual incidence of recurrence after the first venous thrombosis varies from 4.2 to 6.5% on vitamin k-antagonists and is doubled after discontinuation. the highest incidence of recurrence occurs after cerebral and hepatic vein thrombosis (8.8 and 8 per 100 pt-years, respectively). the occurrence of major bleeding on vitamin k-antagonists is similar to a non-mpn population and accounts for a rate of 1.8-2.4 per 100 pt-years. summary after venous thrombosis, the incidence of recurrence in mpn remains elevated, which suggested there was a need to review the current recommendations of primary and secondary prophylaxis.
polycythemia_vera	objective: in an era of controversy in regard to 'hydroxyurea-leukaemogenicity' and when interferon-alfa2 (ifn) is being revived in the treatment of philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns), we aim in this single-centre observational study to describe the frequencies of second malignancies in a cohort of mpn patients treated with hydroxyurea (hu) or ifn monotherapy or the combination of these agents. patients and methods: records of a mpn cohort of 196 patients were reviewed, and a retrospective analysis was performed on 90 patients treated with hu, 38 patients treated with ifn and 68 patients treated with both ifn and hu. logistic regression was used to compare frequencies in second malignancies. results: patients treated with hu had a significantly higher risk of developing all second malignancies compared with patients treated with ifn [hu vs. ifn: or of 4.01 (95% ci: 1.12-14.27, pvalue: 0.023) and hu-ifn vs. ifn: or 5.58 (95% ci: 1.55-20.15, p-value: 0.004)]. conclusion: we have found an increased risk of second malignancies in mpn patients treated with hu compared with patients treated with ifn.
polycythemia_vera	chromosomal abnormalities at 14q11, which encodes the t-cell receptor alpha and delta chain genes, are generally specific for t-cell malignancies, and are rarely reported in other malignancies. we report a novel t(11;14)(p13;q11.2) in a patient with myelofibrosis (mf) following polycythemia vera (pv). this 55-year-old male developed post-pv mf 12 years after the initial diagnosis of pv. he had a normal karyotype at polycythemic disease stage, t(11;14)(p13;q11.2) was newly detected at the time of fibrotic transformation. therefore, it is likely that this clonal chromosomal abnormality was associated with progression of disease.
polycythemia_vera	besides genetic abnormalities in mpn patients, several studies have reported alterations in protein expression that could contribute towards the clinical phenotype. however, little is known about protein modifications in ph- mpn erythrocytes. in this context, we used a quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics approach to study the mpn erythrocyte proteome. lc-ms/ms (ltq orbitrap) analysis led to the identification of 51 and 86 overexpressed proteins in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia respectively, compared with controls. functional comparison using pathway analysis software showed that the rho gtpase family signaling pathways were deregulated in mpn patients. in particular, iqgap1 was significantly overexpressed in mpns compared with controls. additionally, western-blot analysis not only confirmed iqgap1 overexpression, but also showed that iqgap1 levels depended on the patient 's genotype. moreover, we found that in jak2v617f patients iqgap1 could bind rhoa, rac1 and cdc42 and consequently recruit activated gtp-rac1 and the cytoskeleton motility protein pak1. in calr( +) patients, iqgap1 was not overexpressed but immunoprecipitated with rhogdi. in jak2v617f transduced ba/f3 cells we confirmed jak2 inhibitor-sensitive overexpression of iqgap1/pak1. altogether, our data demonstrated alterations of iqgap1/rho gtpase signaling in mpn erythrocytes dependent on jaic2/calr status, reinforcing the hypothesis that modifications in erythrocyte signaling pathways participate in ph- mpn pathogenesis.
