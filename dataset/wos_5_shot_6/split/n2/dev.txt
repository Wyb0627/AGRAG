electric_motor	in this paper, an electric bicycle motor design study is presented according to the related standard. fundamental dimensions and characteristics are kept within some certain boundaries by means of motor rated power and physical constraints arising from standard bicycle sizes available on the market. slot/pole ratios and winding configurations are investigated comprehensively in order to obtain a proper design of electric motor due to the facts of pedal assisted electric bicycle application. after defining the motor parameters and the materials that are used the motor design an optimisation attempts are undertaken by using an analytical solver which is employing both numerical calculations and finite element method (fem) analyses. motor designs are assessed based on torque production, weigh, efficiency and ease-of-manufacture. a concise experimental study is conducted for prototype motor in order to evaluate validity of design study.
electric_motor	because of their improved magnetic properties, fe-si alloys are widely used for new electric motor generations. the use of punching process to obtain these components specially affects their mechanical behavior and fatigue strength. this work aims at studying the influence of punching operations on the fatigue behavior of a fe-si alloy. high cycle fatigue tests are performed on different smooth specimen configurations with either punched or polished edges. results show a significant decrease of the fatigue strength for punched specimens compared to polished ones. to understand the origin of the fatigue failure on punched specimens, sem observations of the fracture surfaces are carried out. they reveal that crack initiation always occurs on a punch defect. additional experimental techniques are combined to characterize how the edges are altered by punching. the impact of punching operations on residual stresses and hardening is then investigated. residual stresses are quantified on punched edges using x-ray diffraction techniques. important tensile residual stresses exist in the loading direction as a result of punching operations. also, according to xrd analyses and micro-hardness measurements, the hardened zone depth is about 200 mu m. to dissociate the respective influences of strain hardening, residual stresses and geometrical defects, a heat treatment is applied to both punched and polished specimens in order to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the high cycle fatigue resistance. results show that the geometry of defects is one of the most influent parameters. consequently, a finite element model is developed to simulate the influence of edge defects on the fatigue strength of punched components. a non-local high cycle fatigue criterion is finally used as post-processing of fea to consider the effect of defects and the associated stress-strain gradients in the hcf strength assessment. copyright (c) 2016 the authors. published by elsevier b.v.

electric_motor	we aim at finding an optimal design for an interior permanent magnet electric motor by means of a sensitivity-based topology optimization method. the gradient-based on/off method has been successfully applied to optimization problems of this form. we show that this method can be improved by considering the mathematical concept of topological derivatives (tds). tds for optimization problems constrained by linear partial differential equations (pdes) are well understood, whereas little is known about tds in combination with nonlinear pde constraints. we derive the td for an optimization problem constrained by the equation of nonlinear 2-d magnetostatics, illustrate its advantages over the sensitivities used in the on/off method, and show numerical results for the optimization of an interior permanent magnet electric motor obtained by a level-set algorithm, which is based on the td.

digital_control	high-performance phase-locked loops (plls) are critical for power control in grid-connected systems. this paper presents a new method of designing a pll for single-phase systems based on derivative elements (des). the quadrature signal generator (qsg) is constructed by two des with the same parameters. the pll itself is realized by using the de-based qsg. it avoids errors due to the overlap and accumulation that are present in plls based on integral elements, such as a pll based on a second-order generalized integrator. additionally, frequency feedback is not needed which allows the proposed pll to achieve high performance when the grid frequency changes rapidly. this paper presents the model of the pll and a theoretical performance analysis with respect to both the frequency-domain and time-domain behavior. the error arising from the discretization process is also compensated, ensuring this pll method is suitable for implementation in a digital control system. simulation and experimental results show that the proposed pll achieves good performance in both harmonic rejection and dynamic response.
digital_control	silicon rf power amplifiers (pas) are in various rf front end modules (fems) today for handset and wlan applications. even though iii-v semiconductor-based rf pas can still offer superior frequency and breakdown performance with higher pout and power-added-efficiency (pae) and faster time-to-market, silicon-based rf pas do have the advantages in offering higher monolithic integration with added functionalities (e.g., on-chip digital control and selection on power level, modulation, frequency band, matching, predistortion, etc.), which can translate to lower cost and smaller sizes attractive for broadband multi-mode multi-band handset transmitters. therefore, some key techniques for designing high-efficiency 4g/5g/wlan broadband wireless silicon pas will be discussed.
digital_control	loudspeakers line arrays are very common reproduction sound systems used in real environments (e.g., theaters, stadiums, cinemas, and conference halls) for synthesizing the directivity characteristics of a linear source. the sound field emitted by a vertical line array can be pointed in a particular direction by using digital signal processing techniques and avoiding any mechanical movements. the approach proposed in this paper to obtain the desired directivity behavior takes advantage of the reproduction of a virtual source with frequency-independent directivity characteristics using wave field synthesis theory and introducing a computational complexity reduction. a full investigation on the performance of the technique has been carried out making comparisons with other approaches proposed in the literature thus providing an overview of the results achievable with digital steering of line arrays.

digital_control	the extraction of molten iron and slag in the liquid phase from the lower part of a blast furnace (hearth) is usually accomplished according to operational experience and involves a high degree of uncertainty, mainly because the liquid level cannot be directly measured. this study presents a methodology for obtaining multistep models to forecast the hearth liquid level by measuring a voltage generated on the blast furnace shell, which is strongly correlated with the hearth liquid level. the results show that this electrical signal is a nonstationary and nonlinear time-series that, after appropriate treatment, can be represented by a time-delay neural network (tdnn) model. some comparisons are made with linear time-series models represented by an autoregressive moving average model and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, and the results indicate that the tdnn model provides better forecasting performance up to one hour ahead. note to practitioners-this work was motivated by the need for better knowledge regarding the liquid level in a blast furnace hearth because this information affects the strategy of the opening and closing of tapholes in the blast furnace and, consequently, the production control and operational quality. due to the difficulties of measuring the liquid level in the hearth directly, a system was installed that uses a voltage generated in the hearth shell as a liquid-level sensor in the hearth. in this study, the analysis and treatment of this signal is performed by achieving a stationary, nonlinear signal strongly correlated with the level of molten iron and slag inside the blast furnace hearth. a mathematical model that represents this signal was developed and implemented online in the blast furnace digital control system to enable forecasting of the liquid level up to one hour ahead. this computational tool aids operators and engineers in deciding in advance the instants to open or close the tapholes, thereby increasing safety and financial gains.
digital_control	wavelength stabilization for a pulsed laser presents more challenges than that of continuous wave laser. we have developed a simple and efficient long-term wavelength drifts compensation technique for tunable pulsed dye lasers (pdl) applied in sodium detection lidar system. wavelength calibration and locking are implemented by using optogalvanic (og) spectroscopy in a na hollow cathode lamp (hcl) in conjunction with a digital control software. optimization of og signals for better laser wavelength discrimination and feedback control is performed. test results indicate that locking the multimode broadband pdl to the na atomic transition corresponding to 589.158 nm is well achieved although the temperature in the laboratory is unstable. through active compensation, the maximum wavelength drift is reduced from over 5 pm to 0.42 pm in 10 h and the maximum wavelength drift rate of the pdl is improved from 3.3 pm/h to 0.3 pm/h it has been used to efficient sodium resonance fluorescence lidar detection. this technique is economical and easy to implement, and it provides flexible wavelength control and allows generalization for some other applications which require the wavelength of tunable pulsed lasers to be fixed at an atomic resonance transition references.

microcontroller	in wireless data transmissions processes, data loss is an important factor that reduces the robustness of wireless sensor networks (wsns). in many practical engineering applications, data loss compensation algorithms are then required to maintain the robustness, and such algorithms are typically based on compressive sensing with a large memory of microcontrollers needed. this paper presents an improved algorithm, based on random demodulator, to overcome the difficulty of microcontroller-dependence in the traditional data loss algorithms. the newly developed algorithm demonstrates the following advantages: 1) low space complexity; 2) low floating-point calculations; and 3) low time complexity. therefore, it is more suitable to be embedded into ordinary nodes, comparing with the traditional algorithms. in this paper, a wsn based on wifi is also developed for verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm. field experiment on xinghai bay bridge is done. experimental results show that the wsn works properly and steady. moreover, the data loss can be compensated effectively and efficiently through the use of the present algorithm.

microcontroller	processes like landslides, debris flows, or bed load transport, at the intersection between the natural environment and human activity, constitute an increasing threat to people and property. the ability to detect these processes prematurely is an essential task for mitigating these hazards. past studies have shown that debris flows and debris floods emit detectable signals in the low-frequency infrasonic spectrum and induce characteristically seismic signals. a number of monitoring devices and detection methods to identify debris flows using these signals have been developed, but up to date, no warning system based on a combination of seismic and infrasound sensors has been considered. previous studies have already shown that seismic and infrasonic signals of alpine mass movements are correlated and complementary and that the combination of these two sensor types can serve as basis for an error-resistant detection and warning system. so this work aims to develop a detection system for detecting debris flows and debris floods by analyzing the seismic and infrasound waves. the system is build up on a minimum of one seismic and one infrasound sensor which are co-located and a microcontroller which runs a detection algorithm to detect debris flows and debris floods with high accuracy in real time directly on-site. the detection algorithm is based on an analysis of the evolution in time of the frequency content of the mass movement signal and has been tested with debris flows and debris flood signals monitored at different test sites in austria and switzerland. this paper describes the current version of the detection system and gives an example of event detection at the tyrolese test sites lattenbach, dristenau, and farstrinne.
electrical_network	the trend towards electrical drivers rather than mechanical drivers for offshore installation has led to implementation of large electrical systems and power generation. due to the offshore environment constraints such as weight and footprint limitations, most of the installation remains operated at voltage of 13,8 kv and lower which leads to specific constraints on the electrical network design. this paper provides an overview of the implementation of pyrotechnic current limiting devices from the design stage through precommissioning, commissioning and up to operation. a case study will also be developed based on fault event which occurred on a fpso (floating production storage and offloading) leading to severe damage and its consequences on operation conditions. the pyrotechnic current limiting devices operated correctly when the fault occurred. the damage and production losses were due to other causes which will be highlighted.
electrical_network	load flow studies are an essential task carried out in power system planning and operations. however, the widely used deterministic load flow analysis is limited in their handling of network uncertainties or inaccuracies in input data. therefore, probabilistic load flow (plf) based on either numerical methods (such as monte carlo simulation) or an analytical method (such as convolution techniques) was developed in the 1970s to handle power system uncertainties due to variations in electrical network variables. this paper presents a probabilistic load flow analysis method based on convolution techniques. the method is suitable for distribution systems and examines the effect of load, generation and network uncertainties either separately or in combinations thereof. the main features on the paper include: a critical appraisal of existing plf techniques, as published in the literature, is carried out to derive the optimised technique and methodology. the proposed method is applied to practical 47-bus radial distribution network modelled in powerfactory digsilent software package. the results obtained are then exported into matlab for detailed statistical analysis in terms of various probability distribution function (pdf) and cumulative density functions (cdf).
electrical_network	catastrophic circumstances and equipment failures in electrical networks are mostly caused by emerging unidentified phenomena. resonance and ferroresonance are those phenomena, which have been investigated since, many years ago. manitoba hydro 230 kv electrical network has experienced ferroresonant states several times. such conditions may occur in effect of short circuit, breaker phase failure, transformer energizing, load rejection, accidental or scheduled line disconnection, and plant outage. one of the significant consequences of resonant and ferroresonant states can be an apparent mis-operation or tripping some protective devices and inaccurate operation of instrument transformers. in this paper by means of pscad/emtdc simulation software, ferroresonant states are analyzed in manitoba hydro 230 kv network. ferroresonant states are classified in to adequate modes by ferro-resonance detection tools, furthermore; kinds of protective relays subjected to ferroresonance are simulated in the power network, and operation of relays is assessed.
electrical_network	the isotactic polypropylene/carbon black (ipp/cb) and the long-chain branched polypropylene/carbon black (lcbpp/cb) composite melts with the melt blending method and the solution process were chosen in this paper to know the relationship between rheological and electrical percolation process and learn the evolution and the destruction of rheological network. the more rheological percolation threshold than electrical percolation threshold in ipp/cb composites and the less rheological percolation threshold than electrical percolation threshold in lcbpp/cb composites are mainly attributed to the two kinds of mechanisms governing the electrical network and the rheological network. the agglomeration of cb particles which is accelerated by annealing at elevated temperatures promotes the self-perfection of rheological network. the strong interaction between the polar long-chain branched structure and filler also led to the reduced t(p). the network of lcbpp/cb composites is more difficult to be broken than the network of ipp/cb composites with the solution process.
electrical_network	the quality and performances of the compensation of harmonic currents depends strongly on the performances of the identification blocks of control side of the photovoltaic generators used as active filters. then, the use of harmonics identification methods is not valid because the network voltage must be sinusoidal and balanced, which is not the case in practice. hence, to make the application of the identification methods of harmonic currents versatile and for any voltage form, we use the detection system of the fundamental component of the direct voltage. in this paper, a comparison between the conventional method used for extracting the direct component of the network voltage which is based on the phase-locked loop (pll) and the new approach based on a multivariable extraction filter. finally, simulation results show that the proposed multivariable filter may better work even if the network voltage is (perturbed and unbalanced). furthermore, this filters permits to generalize the use of identification methods for filtering the different perturbations of active and reactive current.

electricity	the transmission network switching is proposed in the literature as a way to improve social welfare in liberalized power markets. (7) moreover, exercise of market power by strategic generating companies (gencos) causes some extra cost in electricity market which can be alleviated by implementing appropriate switching policies. this paper contributes td the existing literature by developing a mathematical model that explores, from an economic perspective, the transmission network switching in the context of market power. the strategic gecnos are modelled based on the cournot game. the nash equilibrium of the game between gencos is formulated as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraint (epec). the epec problem is transformed to a mixed-integer linear feasibility problem. to handle the multiple nash-equilibria situations, the solution concept of the extremal-nash equilibrium (ene) is introduced. a mixed-integer linear program (milp) is derived for finding ene. the transmission switching decisions are modelled as binary variables controlled by the system operator (tso). the tso minimizes the system dispatch cost calculated at ene and network reconfiguration cost. the tso minimizes the cost using its transmission switching decisions. the problem faced by the tso is a mixed-integer bilevel linear program (miblp) with binary variables in both upper and lower levels. the upper level models the tso 's action and the lower level the oligopolistic gencos (competing in cournot game). a (parallel) branch and-bound technique is used to solve the developed miblp model. an illustrative 3-bus example system and the ieee-rts96 are modelled and carefully studied. (8)the numerical results demonstrate that: 1 - the (parallel) branch-and-bound technique can effectively solve the developed miblp, 2 - using the developed model, the system operator can change topology of the network by switching the lines in order to reduce the adverse effect of the strategic behaviour of gecnos.

electricity	the growing demand for electric vehicles entails an increased consumption of critical energetic and non-energetic abiotic resources, necessary for an optimal performance of the vehicle. the depletion of these resources and the future availability to meet their demand appears to be a potential limitation for the expansion of the electrified vehicle industry. the goal of this study is to perform a detailed life cycle analysis, including manufacturing, use and disposal, of key components of ev powertrains, identifying materials and processes responsible for abiotic depletion impact. this study also investigates the sensitivity of the results to the choice of life cycle assessment (lca) impact methods. for this, a lca is performed on an integrated electric drive, by considering seven impact methods. results show that energetic resources consumption generate the largest impact, followed by metals and lastly by mineral resources. the consumption of electricity in each life cycle is a crucial factor in the generation of total impact. there are agreements among methods on the materials and processes contributing the most to depletion, given the differences in approach used by each impact method.

electricity	the united states geological survey estimates that over four trillion barrels of crude oil are currently trapped within u.s. oil shale reserves. however, no cost-effective, environmentally sustainable method for oil production from oil shale currently exists. given the continuing demand for low-cost fossil-fuel production, alternative methods for shale-oil extraction are needed. geothermic fuel cells (tm) (gfc) harness the heat generated by high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells during electricity generation to process oil shale into ""sweet"" crude oil. in this paper, a thermo-electrochemical model is exercised to simulate the performance of a 4.5 kw(e) (gross) geothermic fuel cell module for in situ oil-shale processing. the gfc analyzed in this work is a prototype which contains three 1.5 kw(e) solid oxide fuel cell (sofc) stack-and-combustor assemblies packaged within a 0.3 m diameter, 1.8 m tall, stainless-steel housing. the high-temperature process heat produced by the sofcs during electricity generation is used to retort oil shale within underground geological formations into high-value shale oil and natural gas. a steady-state system model is developed in aspen plus (tm) using user-defined subroutines to predict the stack electrochemical performance and the heat-rejection from the module. the model is validated against empirical data from independent single-stack performance testing and full gfc-module experiments. following model validation, further simulations are performed for different values of current, fuel and air utilization to study their influence on system electrical and heating performance. the model is used to explore a wider range of operating conditions than can be experimentally tested, and provides insight into the competing physical processes at play during geothermic fuel cell operation. results show that the operating conditions can be tuned to generate desired heat-flux conditions as needed across applications.

operational_amplifier	this paper presents an efficient approach for the optimal designs of two analog circuits, namely complementary metal oxide semiconductor) two-stage comparator with p-channel metal oxide semiconductor input driver and n-channel input and folded-cascode operational amplifier using a recently proposed meta-heuristic-based optimization algorithm named as colliding bodies optimization (cbo). it is a multi-agent algorithm that does not depend upon any internal control parameter, making the algorithm extremely simple. the main objective of this paper is to optimize the metal oxide semiconductor (mos) transistors' sizes using cbo in order to reduce the areas occupied by the circuits and to get better performance parameters of the circuits. simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis simulation has been carried out by using the optimal values of mos transistors' sizes and other design parameters to validate that cbo-based design is satisfying the desired specifications. simulation results demonstrate that the design specifications are closely met and the required functionalities are achieved. the simulation results also confirm that the cbo-based approach is superior to the other algorithms in terms of mos area and performance parameters like gain, power dissipation, etc., for the examples considered. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
operational_amplifier	this paper presents a novel adaptive bias technique based on the use of squaring circuits. here, the tail current of an operational amplifier (opamp) is controlled using an auxiliary circuit. by design, it generates a well-controlled tail current which - to a first order approximation-is independent of the opamp 's common-mode input voltage. as a result, parameters like common-mode rejection ratio (cmrr) and power supply rejection ratio (psrr) are enhanced. however, when a differential input signal is applied, it generates a tail current proportional to the square of the opamp 's differential input voltage. in this way, the currents of the opamp 's input pairs are boosted, thus improving slew rate. experimental results in 0.5 mu m cmos technology verify current and slew rate enhancement factors between 10 and 15 with less than 20% static current increase.
operational_amplifier	the swipe detector of the ballon borne mission lspe (see e.g. the contribution of p. de bernardis et al. in this conference) intends to measure the primordial 'b-mode' polarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb). for this scope microwave telescopes need sensitive cryogenic bolometers with an overall equivalent noise temperature in the nk range. the detector is a spiderweb bolometer based on transition edge sensor and followed by a squid to perform the signal readout. this contribution will concentrate on the design, description and first tests on the front-end electronics which processes the squid output (and controls it). the squid output is first amplified by a very low noise preamplifier based on a discrete jfet input differential architecture followed by a low noise cmos operational amplifier. equivalent input noise density is 0.6 nv/hz and bandwidth extends up to at least 2 mhz. both devices (jfet and cmos amplifier) have been tested at liquid nitrogen. the second part of the contribution will discuss design and results of the control electronics, both the flux locked loop for the squid and the slow control chain to monitor and set up the system will be reviewed. the digital interface to the control computer will be presented.

analog_signal_processing	in real-time catheter-based 3-d ultrasound imaging applications, gathering data from the transducer arrays is difficult, as there is a restriction on cable count due to the diameter of the catheter. although area and power hungry multiplexing circuits integrated at the catheter tip are used in some applications, these are unsuitable for use in small sized catheters for applications, such as intracardiac imaging. furthermore, the length requirement for catheters and limited power available to on-chip cable drivers leads to limited signal strength at the receiver end. in this paper, an alternative approach using analog time-division multiplexing (tdm) is presented, which addresses the cable restrictions of ultrasound catheters. a novel digital demultiplexing technique is also described, which allows for a reduction in the number of analog signal processing stages required. the tdm and digital demultiplexing schemes are demonstrated for an intracardiac imaging system that would operate in the 4- to 11-mhz range. a tdm integrated circuit (ic) with an 8: 1 multiplexer is interfaced with a fast analog-to-digital converter (adc) through a microcoaxial catheter cable bundle, and processed with a field-programmable gate array register-transfer level simulation. input signals to the tdm ic are recovered with -40-db crosstalk between the channels on the same microcoax, showing the feasibility of this system for ultrasound imaging applications.
state_space_representation	we consider exact sampling from the stationary distribution of a closed queueing network with finite capacities. in a recent work a compact representation of sets of states was proposed that enables exact sampling from the stationary distribution without considering all initial conditions in the coupling from the past (cftp) scheme. this representation reduces the complexity of the one-step transition in the cftp algorithm to o(km2), where k is the number of queues and m the total number of customers; while the cardinality of the state space is exponential in the number of queues. in this paper, we extend these previous results to the multiserver case. the main focus and the contribution of this paper is on the algorithmic and the implementation issues. we propose a new representation, that leads to one-step transition complexity of the cftp algorithm that is in o(km). we provide a detailed description of our matrix-based implementation. matlab toolbox clones (closed queueing networks exact sampling) can be downloaded at http://www.di.ens.fr/similar to rovetta/clones.

state_space_representation	structural optimization has been shown to be an efficient and effective method to obtain the optimal design balancing competing objectives. however, literature on optimization of structures subject to random excitation is sparse. this study proposes a performance-based optimization approach for nonlinear structures subject to stochastic dynamic excitation. the optimization procedure is formulated as a multi objective problem considering various performance objectives. the excitation is modeled as a zero-mean filtered white noise and combined with the nonlinear equations of motion of the structure to create an augmented state space representation of the system. the optimization objectives are defined in terms of the variance of stationary structural responses, which are obtained via equivalent linearization. thus, the stochastic optimization problem is converted into its deterministic counterpart. numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. three levels of seismic magnitudes, i.e., low-level, frequent earthquake, medium-intensity earthquake and high-intensity earth-quake, are investigated. for each seismic magnitude, two performance objectives are considered. the first performance objective considers serviceability, seeking to minimize floor acceleration response; and the second performance objective considers structural safety and seeks to minimize interstory drift response. the pareto optimal fronts are calculated to illustrate the intrinsic tradeoffs between serviceability and safety of designs subject to all seismic magnitudes.

state_space_representation	in this paper, stochastic optimal strategy for unknown linear discrete-time system quadratic zero-sum games in input-output form with communication imperfections such as network-induced delays and packet losses, otherwise referred to as networked control system (ncs) zero-sum games, relating to the h optimal control problem is solved in a forward-in-time manner. first, the linear discrete-time zero sum state space representation is transformed into a linear ncs in the state space form after incorporating random delays and packet losses and then into the input-output form. subsequently, the stochastic optimal approach, referred to as adaptive dynamic programming (adp), is introduced which estimates the cost or value function to solve the infinite horizon optimal regulation of unknown linear ncs quadratic zero-sum games in the presence of communication imperfections. the optimal control and worst case disturbance inputs are derived based on the estimated value function in the absence of state measurements. an update law for tuning the unknown parameters of the value function estimator is derived and lyapunov theory is used to show that all signals are asymptotically stable (as) and that the estimated control and disturbance signals converge to optimal control and worst case disturbances, respectively. simulation results are included to verify the theoretical claims.
signal-flow_graph	in this paper, the correspondence between the weighted line graph and the mason signal flow graph (msfg) has been established, which gives an interpretation of a convolutional network code (cnc) over a, cyclic network from a different perspective. furthermore, by virtue of mason theorem, we present two new equivalent conditions to evaluate whether the global encoding kernels (geks) can be uniquely determined by the given complete set of local encoding kernels (leks) in a cnc over a cyclic network. these two new equivalent conditions turn out to be more intuitive. moreover, we give an alternative simple proof of an existing result.
signal-flow_graph	this paper presents a new method to automatically generate hierarchical placement rules, which are crucial for a successful analog placement. the method is based on a novel symmetry computation method, introducing the structural signal flow graph. five types of proximity, matching and symmetry constraints are determined. according to the priority of the constraint types, a constraint requirement graph and a hierarchical partitioning of the circuit into matching, proximity and symmetry groups is then automatically computed. based on experimental results with a state-of-the-art placement tool, we show that the new approach generates more placement rules and can lead to better circuit performance and parametric yield according to post-layout simulation.
signal-flow_graph	in this work, two active only grounded-c equivalents of third-order voltage-mode (vm) elliptic low-pass (lp) lc ladder prototype are proposed. as active building blocks (abbs) the recently introduced current follower transconductance amplifier (cfta) were used. the first active only grounded-c lp filter employing eight cftas was proposed by interconnecting cfta-based active equivalent sub-blocks of passive components, where one of the low-impedance input terminals is not used. since such feature may cause some noise injection into the proposed circuit, the proposed filter was optimized using mason-coates' signal flow graph approach. in several steps the number of abbs was reduced by two and the unused input terminal was eliminated. the performance of the novel and optimized active only grounded-c third-order vm elliptic lp filter was tested experimentally using the readily available ucc-n1b integrated circuit.
signal-flow_graph	the paper deals with synthesis of active frequency filters and oscillators for applications in the video band. the synthesis is based on the modified signal flow graph design approach in the current mode. the commercially available high frequency current conveyors and second order structures are used. basic structure is employing loss-less and lossy current mode integrators in two distributed feedback loops. some of the used active elements allow to control current gain which is very useful in applications. high frequency multi-functional filter and electronically adjustable quadrature oscillator configurations are discussed. most of the used passive elements (mainly capacitors) are grounded which is suitable for ic implementation. simulation and experimental results demonstrate function and features very well.
signal-flow_graph	in this paper, we present branching oriented system equation based on-line error correction scheme for recursive digital signal processing. the target digital signal processing is linear and time-invariant, and the algorithm includes multiplications with constant coefficient, additions and delays. the difficulties of the algorithm-level fault tolerance for such algorithm without structural regularity include error distribution problem and right timing of error correction. to escape the error distribution problem, multiple fan-out nodes in an algorithm are specified as the nodes at which error corrections are performed. the branching oriented graph and branching oriented system equation are so introduced to formulate on-line correction schemes based on this strategy. the branching oriented graph is treated as the collection of computation sub-blocks. applying checksum code independently to each sub-block is our most trivial on-line error correction scheme, and it results in, with appropriate selection of error identification process, tmr in sub-block level. one of the advantages of our method is in the reduction of redundant operations performed by merging some computation sub-blocks. on the other hand, the schedulability of the system is an important issue for our method since our on-line error correction mechanism induces additional data dependencies. in this paper, the schedulability condition and some modifications on the scheme are also discussed.
electrical_circuits	while teaching network analysis to undergraduate students, the frequency response of electrical circuits consisting of passive elements such as resistors, capacitors and inductors are commonly analysed. students are familiar with the sharp amplitude peak or trough normally occurring at resonance. this observation is not only intuitively pleasing, but also consistent with the concept of resonance in many physical systems. in the well-known series and parallel rlc circuits, the maximum and minimum currents, respectively, occur at resonance. because of this, many students and even instructors (sometimes) may erroneously assume that the resonance in general rlc circuits implies maximum or minimum current. in this paper, it will be shown that this is generally untrue. the theoretical analyses and experimental validation of series, parallel and series-parallel rlc circuits are presented to address this common misconception.
electrical_circuits	this paper concerns the effect that a stochastic resonance can have on a vibration isolation system. rather than reducing the transmitted force, it is shown that it is possible to significantly mask the component of the force transmitted though the isolator, when the system is excited harmonically. this can be achieved by adding a very low intensity of random noise to the harmonic excitation force. the nonlinear mechanical vibration isolation system used in the study consists of a vertical linear spring in parallel with two horizontal springs, which are configured so that the potential energy of the system has a double-well. prior to the analytical and numerical study, an experiment to demonstrate stochastic resonance in a mechanical system is described.

electrical_circuits	we study the problem of inverse minimum dynamic cut (imdc), which changes a capacity vector u in such a way that a given dynamic cut and the applied changes are minimum, using the euclidean norm l(1) to measure these changes. our aim is to solve an inverse minimum dynamic cut, by finding a maximum dynamic flow in a time-expanded network flow and, having calculated the appropriate algorithm, analyzing the relationships between the time-expanded networks, the maximum flow, and the minimum cut. first, we show a specified dynamic cut, to be optimized; the capacity of arcs should be reduced. this study is useful in cases where the network should be divided into two parts by cutting such that this cut has the minimum weight. it is applicable in physics, chemistry, computer networks and electrical circuits, etc. the advantage of this method is the use of time-expanded network to be static corresponding to a dynamic network and algorithm is easily displayed on this network. finally, the algorithm is implemented on a numerical example of dynamic network flow.
electrical_circuits	graph clustering has been an essential part in many methods and thus its accuracy has a significant effect on many applications. in addition, exponential growth of real-world graphs such as social networks, biological networks and electrical circuits demands clustering algorithms with nearly-linear time and space complexity. in this paper we propose personalized pagerank clustering (ppc) that employs the inherent cluster exploratory property of random walks to reveal the clusters of a given graph. we combine random walks and modularity to precisely and efficiently reveal the clusters of a graph. ppc is a top-down algorithm so it can reveal inherent clusters of a graph more accurately than other nearly-linear approaches that are mainly bottom-up. it also gives a hierarchy of clusters that is useful in many applications. ppc has a linear time and space complexity and has been superior to most of the available clustering algorithms on many datasets. furthermore, its top-down approach makes it a flexible solution for clustering problems with different requirements.

electrical_circuits	the purpose of this paper is to determine physical electrical circuits, in both impedance and admittance forms, that match fractional-order integrators and differentiators, namely 1/s(q) and s(q). then, using these idealized infinite-dimensional circuits, the energy storage and loss expressions for them are determined, carefully relating the associated infinite dimensional state variables to physically meaningful quantities. the resulting realizations and energy expressions allow a variety of implementations for understanding the transient behavior of fractional-order systems.
lorentz_force_law	magnetically levitated planar motor is a new-generation motion device in modern precision industry, while its advanced motion controller design is still of main concern. in this paper, a learning adaptive robust control (larc) motion controller is proposed for a magnetically levitated planar motor developed in our laboratory to achieve good tracking performance. the planar motor consists of a halbach permanent magnetic array as the stator, and a levitated platen containing four groups of three-phase windings as the mover. based on the lorentz force law, the mover placed in the magnetic field is subjected to vertical force for levitation and horizonal force for planar motion through dynamics decoupling and current allocation. an larc control scheme containing adaptive robust control (arc) term and iterative learning control (ilc) term in a serial structure is then proposed for the magnetically levitated planar motor to achieve high-performance tracking even there exist parametric variations and uncertain disturbances. comparative experiments between traditional lead, arc, ilc, and the proposed larc are carried out on the planar motor to track sinusoidal, point-to-point, and planar circular motions, respectively. the experimental results consistently validate that the proposed larc control strategy outperforms other controllers much, and possesses not only good transient/steady-state tracking performance but also parametric adaptation ability and uncertain disturbance robustness. the proposed scheme actually provides a practically effective technique for motion control of magnetically levitated planar motors in industrial applications.
lorentz_force_law	the analytical calculation of magnetic forces is currently an interesting alternative to the time-consuming 3-d finite-element method due to their high accuracy and low computational cost. in this paper, a new semi-analytical solution for determining the levitation force of the repulsive magnetic guidance that has a significant role for controlling and developing high precision magnetic levitation positioning system is presented. an important result is that this new expression, compared with other known equations in the literature, considers the position dependence of the magnetic levitation force over the whole travel range. in order to derive this force, the magnetic field of the permanent magnet is first calculated by introducing and solving the magnetic scalar potential. taking lorentz force law into consideration, the proposed equation is finally derived. this semi-analytical equation is suitable for designing and optimizing the magnetic guidance. furthermore, it can also be used for developing other ironless actuators. the calculated levitation force from the derived equation and the verification by measurements are likewise presented in this paper.
lorentz_force_law	current sensing is widely used in power electronic applications such as dc-dc power converters and adjustable-speed motor drives. such power converters are the basic building blocks of drivetrains in electric, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. the performance and control of such vehicles depend on the accuracy, bandwidth, and efficiency of its sensors. various current-sensing techniques based on different physical effects such as faraday 's induction law, ohm 's law, lorentz force law, the magnetoresistance effect, and the magnetic saturation effect are described in this paper. each technique is reviewed and examined. the current measurement methods are compared and analyzed based on their losslessness, simplicity, and ease of implementation.
lorentz_force_law	it is shown from newton 's second law and the conservation of linear momentum, for arbitrary types of force, that the full ""formula force"" used in the second law is effective in exerting observable ponderomotive action on a test element only if the force-exerting element is infinitely massive or is otherwise immobilized in an inertial system to preclude its recoil. in the more realistic case of finite mass m of a force-exerting element free to recoil under mutual action-reaction, the recoil motion ""steals"" energy from the observable force action, so that the physically effective force exerted on a test element of mass m can be represented as the product of formula force and an inertial modulation factor omega = m/(m + m) less than or equal to 1. application of this elementary result to classical electrodynamics shows that it can invalidate (as physics) many of the theorems universally taken for granted since the nineteenth century. for instance, the well-established mathematical theorem that a closed current loop external to a straight current-carrying test element necessarily exerts zero longitudinal ponderomotive force on the latter (for the lorentz force law, the original ampere force law, and all others differing from these only by an additive exact differential quantity) need not be valid physically, the reason is that the inertial factor omega has been overlooked. its presence as an extra factor (green 's function) multiplying the force differential can spoil the exact differential nature of the loop integrand. for instance, if the external loop is physically configured with a ""weak link,"" namely, an ""unanchored"" section of conductor of relatively low mass m much less than m and high mobility (freedom to recoil), then along this portion of the circuit omega approximate to 0, whereas for the remainder of the circuit, if anchored in the laboratory, omega approximate to 1. hence an integral around the whole circuit treats the low-mass portion of the circuit much as if it were an open gap despite the presence of current in it. this proposition is easily put to observational test. by using an electromagnetically driven tuning fork bearing straight segments of current-carrying conductor as sensor (test element), so arranged as to respond to longitudinal force, it has been confirmed through an observed alteration of fork resonance response under ac excitation that a suitably configured weak link in an external closed electrical circuit can, indeed, cause a readily detectable violation of the closed-loop-no-longitudinal-force theorem. in sum, we have exhibited ""cross talk"" between electromagnetic and inertial properties of conducting circuits that can limit the applicability of many of the classical electrodynamic theorems concerning ""closed loops."" such theorems are assuredly valid only in the special case of completely immobilized force-exerting circuits, or circuits all parts of which are constrained to prescribed states of motion (not free to recoil). the ability to violate classical theorems that for a century have made empirical choices among candidate force laws ""impossible"" implies that now experiments can be designed to allow such choices to be made unambiguously.
lorentz_force_law	it is known that for the magnetic force due to a closed circuit, the weber force law can be identical to the lorentz force law. in this investigation it is shown that for both the electric and the magnetic force of the quasi-static case, the riemann force law can be identical to the lorentz force law, while the former is based oil a potential energy depending on a relative speed and is in accord with newton 's law of action and reaction.
system_identification	inferring properties of the interaction matrix that characterizes how nodes in a networked system directly interact with each other is a well-known network reconstruction problem. despite a decade of extensive studies, network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. the fundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix (e.g. adjacency pattern, sign pattern or degree sequence) can be inferred from given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. here, we rigorously derive the necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction matrix. counterintuitively, we find that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically as difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself, requiring equally informative temporal data. revealing these fundamental limitations sheds light on the design of better network reconstruction algorithms that offer practical improvements over existing methods.
system_identification	closed-loop systems of an electro-hydraulic servo system including position, acceleration, and force closed-loop systems and their closed-loop transfer functions based on parameter model are adaptive identified using a recursive extended least-squares algorithm. the position and force closed-loop tracking controllers are designed by a proportional-integral-derivative controller and are tuned by the position and force step signals. the acceleration closed-loop tracking controller is designed by a three-variable controller and the three states include position, velocity, and acceleration. experimental results of the estimated position, acceleration, and force closed-loop transfer functions are performed on an actual electro-hydraulic servo system using xpc rapid prototyping technology, which clearly demonstrate the benefit of the adaptive identification method.
system_identification	in this paper, an online system identification method is introduced for lifetime diagnostic of supercapacitors. the online strategy uses a lyapunov-based adaptation law to estimate online the supercapacitor 's parameters. therefore, the adaptive observer 's stability is guaranteed by lyapunov 's direct method. state-of-health (soh) estimation is crucial since aging introduces degradation in supercapacitors' performance, which might eventually lead to their failure. soh is usually measured by offline time or frequency domain characterization techniques such as spectroscopy. however, these methods require interruption of the system 's operation, and hence, they are not suitable for real-time applications such as electric vehicles. unlike other online estimation strategies, only voltage and current measurements are required. simulation and experimental results along with comparison against two different methods highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in estimating the soh.
system_identification	speech is a multisensory percept, comprising an auditory and visual component. while the content and processing pathways of audio speech have been well characterized, the visual component is less well understood. in this work, we expand current methodologies using system identification to introduce a framework that facilitates the study of visual speech in its natural, continuous form. specifically, we use models based on the unheard acoustic envelope (e), the motion signal (m) and categorical visual speech features (v) to predict eeg activity during silent lipreading. our results show that each of these models performs similarly at predicting eeg in visual regions and that respective combinations of the individual models (ev, mv, em and emv) provide an improved prediction of the neural activity over their constituent models. in comparing these different combinations, we find that the model incorporating all three types of features (emv) outperforms the individual models, as well as both the ev and mv models, while it performs similarly to the em model. importantly, em does not outperform ev and mv which, considering the higher dimensionality of the v model, suggests that more data is needed to clarify this finding. nevertheless, the performance of emv, and comparisons of the subject performances for the three individual models, provides further evidence to suggest that visual regions are involved in both low-level processing of stimulus dynamics and categorical speech perception. this framework may prove useful for investigating modality-specific processing of visual speech under naturalistic conditions.
system_identification	in many contemporary engineering problems, model uncertainty is inherent because accurate system identification is virtually impossible owing to system complexity or lack of data on account of availability, time, or cost. the situation can be treated by assuming that the true model belongs to an uncertainty class of models. in this context, an intrinsically bayesian robust (ibr) filter is one that is optimal relative to the cost function (in the classical sense) and the prior distribution over the uncertainty class (in the bayesian sense). ibr filters have previously been found for both wiener and granulometric morphological filtering. in this paper, we derive the ibr kalman filter that performs optimally relative to an uncertainty class of state-space models. introducing the notion of bayesian innovation process and the bayesian orthogonality principle, we show how the problem of designing an ibr kalman filter can be reduced to a recursive system similar to the classical kalman recursive equations, except with ""effective"" counterparts, such as the effective kalman gain matrix. after deriving the recursive ibr kalman equations for discrete time, we use the limiting method to obtain the ibr kalman-bucy equations for continuous time. finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for two real world problems: sensor networks and gene regulatory network inference.
pid_controller	fuel cell (fc) systems are appropriate candidates as alternative energy sources for use in stand-alone applications. however, the fc generates an unregulated voltage, which is not suitable in stand-alone application usage solely. this paper presents the control of stand-alone application based on fuzzy pid (fpid) controller. the aim of this paper is designing and controlling a suitable power conditioning unit (pcu) that consists of two dc/dc converter stages and dc/ac inverter. in addition, an analysis of cascade structure based on fuzzy pid controller for a single phase inverter is done and also two feedback control loops are comprised. inductor current and capacitor voltage are measured and sent through feedback to the inner loop and the outer loop, respectively. besides, to evaluate the proposed controller robustness, the pcu is considered under step loads as disturbance. finally, it is shown that the proposed controller has a robust behavior and good transient response.

pid_controller	this paper addresses the design of a robust lyapunov-based controller for flexible-joint electrically driven robots considering to voltage as control input. the proposed approach is related to the key role of electrical subsystem of the motors, thus is free from mechanical subsystem of the actuator dynamics, considered here as unmodeled dynamics. the main contribution of this paper is to prove that the closed-loop system composed by full nonlinear actuated robot dynamics and the proposed controller is bibo stable, while actuator/link position errors are uniformly ultimately bounded stable in agreement with lyapunov 's direct method in any finite region of the state space. it also forms a constructive and conservative algorithm for suitable choice of gains in pid controller. the analytical studies as well as experimental results produced using matlab/simulink external mode control on a flexible-joint electrically driven robot demonstrate high performance of the proposed control schemes.
pid_controller	the controller design for bilateral teleoperation systems involves a delicate trade-off between performance and stability. to achieve high performance, high order robust controllers may not be feasible for real-time implementation because of hardware and computational limitations. the main purpose of this paper is to achieve stability and transparency in the presence of time delay in communication channel as well as model uncertainty. to address these problems, a novel robust fixed-structure controller is proposed for uncertain bilateral teleoperation systems. here, the traditional conventional proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller is employed to achieve the requirements. the simplicity and straightforward design are the significant advantageous of the proposed method. robust stability analysis of the proposed technique is also provided. results demonstrate that the structure is effective in providing stability and transparency in teleoperation systems.
pid_controller	dc-dc power supplies are playing significant role in different domains of engineering applications. some converters such as boost, buck-boost, and fly-back have a right-half-plane zero (non-minimum phase system), hence it is difficult for the pid controller to exhibit good performance with load, line variations and parametric uncertainty. in this proposed work, design and implementation of type controllers have been performed by using k-factor approach and two different optimisation techniques (gravitational search algorithm and particle swarm optimisation) for obtaining better stability and performance for a closed loop dc-dc switched mode boost converter. the closed loop control system has been implemented in real time dspace platform. the comparative closed-loop performances of a boost converter with classical, optimised pid and optimised type ii/type iii controllers have been produced. simulations and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of optimised controllers for the proposed converter. design and implementation of optimised type controller for switch mode converters has not been reported earlier in any literature.
pid_controller	a design of fuzzy-based hierarchal approach is proposedto improve the frequency control in the power system. the simplified great britain (gb) frequency control model, was used as a single bus machine. a new simple tuning method is proposed with the aid of the conventional pid controller gains. the same gains are used to feed the fuzzy controller in the same loop without re-tuning the fuzzy gains. this method allows the fuzzy structure to supplement the conventional control rather than replacing it. particle swarm optimization (pso) is proposed to find the optimal value of the controller gains. five modeling scenarios for the fuzzy control and two cases of uncertain parameters were considered to validate the model. structures of fuzzy controller offered high stability and robustness in the simulation results. therefore, the proposed hierarchal structuresare used in the real-time applications of the load frequency control in the power systems.

voltage_law	this paper presents an investigation on high energy rate micro forming (hermf) of a thin aluminum foil using a high velocity forming (hvf) technique. a model is proposed for the work of deformation and efficiencies involved in every stage of energy transfer. the forming action has been achieved through incident shockwaves, which cause plastic deformation in the blank to take the shape of the die cavity. the shockwaves are generated by a rapid capacitive discharge of energy across a fuse wire inside the water. the paper presents an analysis to predict the amount of energy required for a desired depth of hemispherical deformation, based on the principles of plastic deformation and volume constancy. the energy transferred from the capacitor bank to the fuse wire is modeled using kirchhoff 's voltage law and the joule heating principle. an indigenous micro-electro-hydro-forming (ehf) setup developed in-house is used to validate the analytical model developed through a set of experiments. readings are optimized against the number of parameters present in the entire process. validation for the suggested analytical model is carried out by comparing theoretical and experimentally measured values of the depth of deformation of a 20-mu m thick aluminum foil. the results obtained are encouraging, and the highest error in the predictive ability of our model was found to be 30 %. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at analytically modeling the depth of deformation for a given value of supplied electrical energy in the micro-domain.
voltage_law	in this paper, a new formulation for coupled circuit-electromagnetic (em) simulation is presented. the formulation employs full-wave integral equations to model the em behavior of two- or three-dimensional structures while using modified nodal analysis to model circuit interactions. a coupling scheme based on charge and current continuity and potential matching, realized as a generalization of kirchoff 's voltage and current laws, ensures that the em and circuit interactions can be formulated as a seamless system. while rigorous port models for em structures can be obtained using the approach discussed herein, it is shown that the coupling paradigm can reveal additional details of the em-circuit interactions and can provide a path to analysis-based design iteration.
voltage_law	an optimal design strategy based on genetic algorithms (ga) is proposed for nonlinear hysteretic control devices that prevent pounding damage and achieve the best results in seismic response mitigation of two adjacent structures. an integrated fuzzy controller is used in order to provide the interactive relationships between damper forces and input voltages for mr dampers based on the modified bouc-wen model. furthermore, linear quadratic regulator (lqr) and h-2/lqg (linear quadratic gaussian) controllers based on clipped voltage law (cvl) are also used to compare the results obtained by fuzzy controller. this study employs the main objectives of the optimal design that are not only to reduce the seismic responses but also to minimize the total cost of the damper system. a set of pareto optimal solutions is also conducted with the corresponding results obtained from the optimal surface of pareto solutions in this study. as a result, decreasing the number of dampers does necessarily increase the efficiency of the system. in fact, reducing the number of dampers for the dynamic response of the system can contribute more than increasing the number of dampers.

voltage_law	renewable portfolio standards (rpss) are popular market-based mechanisms for promoting development of renewable power generation. however, they are usually implemented without considering the capabilities and cost of transmission infrastructure. we use single-and multi-stage planning approaches to find cost-effective transmission and generation investments to meet single and multi-year rps goals, respectively. using a six-node network and assuming a linearized dc power flow, we examine how the lumpy nature of network reinforcements and kirchhoff 's voltage law can affect the performance of rpss. first, we show how simplified planning approaches that ignore transmission constraints, transmission lumpiness, or kirchhoff 's voltage law yield distorted estimates of the type and location of infrastructure, as well as inaccurate compliance costs to meet the renewable goals. second, we illustrate how lumpy transmission investments and kirchhoff 's voltage law result in compliance costs that are nonconvex with respect to the rps targets, in the sense that the marginal costs of meeting the rps may decrease rather than increase as the target is raised. thus, the value of renewable energy certificates (recs) also depends on the network topology, as does the amount of noncompliance with the rps, if noncompliance is penalized but not prohibited. finally, we use a multi-stage planning model to determine the optimal generation and transmission infrastructure for rps designs that set multiyear goals. we find that the optimal infrastructure to meet rps policies that are enforced year-by-year differ from the optimal infrastructure if banking and borrowing is allowed in the rec market.
voltage_law	we consider the problem of allocating the cost of a transmission system among load and generator entities. it is a known instance of the classical cooperative game theoretic problem. to solve this problem is a formidable task, as we are dealing with a combinatorial game with transferable utilities. this is an np hard problem. therefore, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. marginal pricing is a pragmatic alternative to solve this problem since both kirchhoff current law and voltage law are strictly adhered to. however, the generic complexity of cooperative game theoretic problems cannot be just wished away. it now manifests as the difficulty in choosing an economic slack bus, which may even be dispersed. we propose the application of min-max fairness policy to solve this problem and give an algorithm which will run in polynomial time. during network cost allocation, min-max fairness policy minimizes the maximum regret among participating entities at each step. maximum regret is measured in terms of price, and lexicographic application of this principle leads to a fair and unique equilibrium price vector. results on a large network demonstrate fairness as well as tractability of the proposed approach.
control_engineering	fractional calculus is more than a three hundred-year-old concept way back during the time of de l'hospital and leibniz focusing on derivative and integrals having non-integer orders. almost four decades ago, engineers and scientists began to venture into the field of fractional calculus by unfolding its applications where fractional differential equation models are valid. it has been found that fractional calculus indeed is becoming ubiquitous, seeing applications in many fields of sciences and engineering, from fractional diffusion equations and various biomedical applications, to signal processing and control engineering applications. a conclusion was then later proposed that fractional calculus is actually a generalization of integer-order calculus, being so powerful, it could overcome the advantages of its integer-order counterparts. this paper offers a comprehensive discussion on the applications of fractional calculus in the design and implementation of fractional-order systems in the form of electronic circuits which could be used for signal processing and control engineering applications. the article starts with the introduction to fractional calculus including some history and mathematical definitions. the second part of the article focuses on fractional-order differential equations and systems. example circuit designs and implementation are then discussed which includes an elaboration of some papers related to this area. the final part of the article presents possible research topics in this area.
control_engineering	this study presents an efficient algorithm for computing precisely the hankel singular values of linear singularly perturbed systems. the algorithm is obtained in terms of reduced-order problems and avoids numerical ill-conditioning associated with singularly perturbed systems when the singular perturbation parameter is very small. the study compares the presented algorithm with the algorithm that exists in the control engineering literature and demonstrates its superiority. in addition, an analysis of system order reduction via balancing and singular perturbations is performed and it is concluded that the system order reduction via balancing is more general than the system order reduction obtained via the method of singular perturbations.
control_engineering	we develop an evolutionary fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (pmsm). we first consider a fuzzy pid control design problem based on the common control engineering knowledge that good transient performances can be obtained by increasing the p and i gains and decreasing the d gain when the transient error is big. then we give an evolutionary algorithm (ea) to autotune the control parameters of the fuzzy pid controller. we implement the proposed ea-based fuzzy pid control controller in real time on a texas instruments tms320f28335 floating-point dsp. we also give simulation and experimental results to show the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent digital control system under abrupt load torque variation using a prototype pmsm.
