state_space_representation	this article presents and analyzes the implementation of risk-sensitive particle filtering algorithm for volatility estimation of continuously compounded returns of financial assets. the proposed approach uses a stochastic state-space representation for the evolution of the dynamic system -the unobserved generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ugarch)model- and an inverse gamma distribution as risk functional (and importance density distribution) to ensure the allocation of particles in regions of the state-space that are associated to sudden changes in the volatility of the system. a set of ad-hoc performance and entropy-based measures is used to compare the performance of this scheme with respect to a classic implementation of sequential monte carlo methods, both in terms of accuracy and precision of the resulting volatility estimates; considering for this purpose data sets generated in a blind-test format with garch structures and time-varying parameters.
electricity	rural electrification rates in india lag behind government goals, in part due to the inability of distribution companies (discoms) to fund central grid expansion. in the absence of central grid electrification, mini-grids offer significant potential for an immediate pathway toward rural electrification and the attendant gains in economic growth and productivity. yet private investment in mini-grids has been virtually absent in india. using a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis, we find that mini-grids based on solar pv power and storage are more economical than incumbent energy services available to households without central grid connection. under current law, a prospective entrepreneur in india does not require a license or certification in order to build a mini-grid and subsequently provide electricity services in the area covered by said installation. conversely, there is no legal or regulatory framework that specifies what is to happen if the central grid were to be extended to an area that is already covered by a mini-grid. we report detailed survey evidence from interviews with entrepreneurs, analysts and policymakers whose assessments converge on the same point: mini-grid investments would be jeopardized in the event of central grid extension, precisely because discoms would, by regulatory order, provide electricity services at highly subsidized rates, well below their full economic cost. our fieldwork suggests that the threat of central grid extension is a gateway barrier preventing mini-grid development in india. the issues associated with the gateway barrier have common elements with the so-called holdup problem as identified in the economics of organizations. there have been two recent federal policy guidelines and one actual state-level policy addressing the regulatory status of mini-grids. we examine the effectiveness of these policies/proposals in terms of an entrepreneur 's willingness to develop mini-grids in the future.

electrical_circuits	silicon photonics which is compatible with mature complementary metal oxide semiconductor (cmos) fabrication process has been extensively demonstrated for monolithic integration of photonic and electrical circuits. we show that an integrated silicon mach-zehnder modulator (mzm) may be used for advanced modulation formats despite the nonlinear dependence of refractive index change with applied voltage in the free-carrier depletion modulator. we experimentally demonstrated the use of a silicon mzm for direct detection optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ddo-ofdm) modulation with advanced data formats of quadrature phase-shift keying (qpsk), 8 phase-shift keying (8psk) and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-qam). the measured bit error rate performance of the back-to-back and 50 km single mode fiber transmission of each format is well below the forward error correction limit.
pid_controller	the imbalance between the generated power and the load demand is the major factor that is usually responsible for frequency instability in power systems, most especially islanded microgrids. to determine the size of the loads that should be shed and their appropriate locations in the power system, to maintain the system frequency within the permissible limits, this paper presents an effective adaptive control scheme. in the proposed controller, a stepwise load-shedding approach is designed in the islanded mgs to regulate the grid frequency while providing the amount of power shortage. to this achieve, it locally measures the system parameters most especially voltage and frequency signals. thereafter, a stepwise load-shedding will take place in locations where the highest voltage drop and frequency variation are experienced. the load-shedding step changes according to certain factors such as shedding speed, location and value, and the rate of frequency change. the proposed approach eliminates the adjustable loads to return the frequency back to the desired value. simulation results of the proposed method under different practical scenarios, when compared with the conventional pid controller, provide considerable enhancement in the power system frequency stability.

microcontroller	this research investigated a method to optimize the start-up performance of a dimmable light-emitting diode (led) driver based on half-bridge class d series-parallel lcc topology. this led driver is designed for outdoor or high bay applications with 347-480 v-ac input voltage. the total maximum output power is 100 w with a wide tunable output current range (from 50 to 800 ma). the wide load range makes it difficult to achieve a startup time of less than 1 s under each load condition as well as limit the output overshoot level to below 150% by implementing only one set of ki values in the feedback loop. moreover, in this design, a fluorescent control ic is used due to the cost efficiency of repurposing existing fluorescent ballast manufacturing systems. the start-up sequence of the fluorescent control ic introduces an additional challenge to the start-up design. in order to comply with energy star, which requires the output current to reach 75% of its nominal value and also limit the overshoot level, a self-adjusted-duty-cycle control algorithm is designed. this duty-cycle signal generated by measuring the load condition through a secondary side microcontroller is used to determine the switching frequency of the lcc tank. with this method, the start-up performance is greatly improved and meets all requirements.

digital_control	this work presents a novel mixed-signal control scheme for a boost power factor correction (pfc) rectifier. the digital controller modulates the inductor peak current to produce a low-distortion ac line current in discontinuous conduction mode (dcm) and continuous conduction mode (ccm), without the need for average current sensing. a lookup table (lut) optimizes efficiency at low input currents, by allowing operation at 125-500-khz dcm based on calculated thresholds. at high input currents, the converter operates at 1-mhz ccm for reduced inductor footprint. an analog off-time generator with a digital frequency locked loop facilitates ccm operation, eliminating the need for slope compensation in the current loop and reduces frequency variations. the lut is programmed with an adaptive output voltage of 250/450 v for low/highmains line voltage (85-265vrms) to optimize efficiency over a broad range of conditions. the 150-w pfc prototype operates up to 1 mhz with a peak efficiency of 95% and a total harmonic distortion of 5%.
microcontroller	we validate a hol4 model of the arm cortex-m0 microcontroller core by testing the model 's behaviour on randomly chosen instructions against real chips from several manufacturers. the model and our intended application involve precise timing information about instruction execution, but the implementations are pipelined, so checking the behaviour of single instructions would not give us sufficient confidence in the model. thus we test the model using sequences of randomly chosen instructions. the main challenge is to meet the constraints on the initial and intermediate execution states: we must ensure that memory accesses are in range and that we respect restrictions on the instructions. by careful transformation of these constraints an off-the-shelf smt solver can be used to find suitable states for executing test sequences. we also use additional constraints to test our hypotheses about the timing anomalies encountered.

control_engineering	this paper proposes a novel radiometric compensation technique for cooperative projection system based-on distributed optimization. to achieve high scalability and robustness, we assume cooperative projection environments such that 1. each projector does not have information about other projectors as well as target images, 2. the camera does not have information about the projectors either, while having the target images, and 3. only a broadcast communication from the camera to the projectors is allowed to suppress the data transfer bandwidth. to this end, we first investigate a distributed optimization based feedback mechanism that is suitable for the required decentralized information processing environment. next, we show that this mechanism works well for still image projection, however not necessary for moving images due to the lack of dynamic responsiveness. to overcome this issue, we propose to implement an additional feedforward mechanism. such a 2 degree of freedom (2-dof) control structure is well-known in control engineering community as a typical method to enhance not only disturbance rejection but also reference tracking capability, simultaneously. we theoretically guarantee and experimentally demonstrate that this 2-dof structure yields the moving image projection accuracy that is overwhelming the best achievable performance only by the distributed optimization mechanisms.

operational_amplifier	this study describes the analysis and design of an improved recycling folded cascode using a new input path and positive feedback which simultaneously increases transconductance considerably. the proposed amplifier with bias circuits and cmfb circuit was simulated with the tsmc 90 nm and hspice circuit simulator @ 1.2 v. according to the simulation results, the proposed circuit shows 75 db, 357 mhz and 359 a mu w as dc gain, gbw and power dissipation respectively. this demonstrates 22 db gain enhancement and 207 mhz gbw improvement, in comparison to recycling the folded cascode (for same capacitor load and power dissipation). finally, corners and monte-carlo simulations were performed to verify the robustness of the proposed circuit versus process, temperature, supply voltage and device dimension mismatch variations.
electric_motor	in a yet another effort to produce better permanent magnet (pm)-less rotor-winding-less brushless electric motor drives, this paper reports work related to multiphase (m = 6) high saliency rotor dual-flat-top alternative current control brushless dc (bldc) reluctance machine drives. the aim is to produce high torque density, low loss/torque in a pm-less rotor-windingless machine by full usage of machine windings and core and of inverter kva. a new derivation of the principle of operation, essential rotary and linear machine topologies, and a 2-d finite-element method (fem) analysis for torque density and torque pulsations on an already built (6 phase, 6 poles, 35 n.m) lab prototype are made available and show promising results. experimental flux decay test results are presented, which, together with standstill torque measurements, validate the finite-element model. advanced iron loss computation by finite-element analysis indicates moderate core loss, although high air-gap magnetic flux density and current harmonics occur as a natural behavior of a bldc machine. electrical and mechanical parameter identification is followed by the development of a circuit model based on fem imported data for parameters and by a four-quadrant control strategy proposal. running experiments (motoring and generating) with speed-reversal and field-weakening modes using a dspace platform, which drives three three-phase inverters that power a star-connected six-phase bldc multiphase reluctance machine are presented, thus showing operation with a reduced number of switches in the inverter.
digital_control	recently, we have reported on a compact microcontroller-based unit developed to accurately synchronize excimer laser pulses (mingesz et al. 2012 fluct. noise lett. 11, 1240007 (doi:10.1142/s021947751240007x)). we have shown that dithering based on random jitter noise plus pseudorandom numbers can be used in the digital control system to radically reduce the long-term drift of the laser pulse from the trigger and to improve the accuracy of the synchronization. in this update paper, we present our new experimental results obtained by the use of the delay-controller unit to tune the timing of a krf excimer laser as an addition to our previous numerical simulation results. the hardware was interfaced to the laser using optical signal paths in order to reduce sensitivity to electromagnetic interference and the control algorithm tested by simulations was applied in the experiments. we have found that the system is able to reduce the delay uncertainty very close to the theoretical limit and performs well in real applications. the simple, compact and flexible system is universal enough to also be used in various multidisciplinary applications.

digital_control	in this paper, a nonlinear current-output digital to analog converter (dac) employing a pseudo-exponential transconductance amplifier is presented. the proposed transconductance amplifier makes use of the code-dependent body-biasing to realize the exponential relationship of the output current to the input digital signal in the cmos technology. a digital control unit is designed to provide a linearly code-dependent voltage to feed into the transconductance amplifier by charging a capacitor for a period determined by a counter which is loaded by the input digital code. the proposed dac is simulated in a 180 nm standard cmos technology. the accuracy of the exponential input-output characteristic is verified by the curve fitting of the simulation results where r-squared value of the fitted functions is greater than 0.999 in all process and temperature corners. the presented dac consumed 79 mu w in the worst-case.
pid_controller	in this paper, the autonomous hybrid power system consisting of wind-turbine generator (wtg), dieselengine generator (deg), fuel-cell (fc) and aqua-electrolyzer (ae) is studied. deg acts as slack generator, whose output power is controlled to have real power balance in the system to keep the frequency deviation within the limit. this paper proposes a new control scheme incorporating pid and pd controllers, to control the output power of deg to keep real power-frequency balance in the system. pid controller is introduced to make the frequency deviation zero under steady-state, after any disturbance. pd controller is incorporated to damp out the oscillations in system frequency, after disturbance. detail analysis of the effect of pid and pd controllers on system mode is presented using participation factor. the sensitivity of system modes to the variation of controller parameters is investigated. simulated responses under isolated operation are presented to show that the proposed control strategy is capable of maintaining power-frequency balance in the system, following any disturbance. the mathematical model of the interconnected system is developed. one feedback loop is added to the existing pid controller in each area to reduce the tie-line power loss. grid-connected and distribution system connected operation of the hybrid power system are also investigated.

electricity	until the banking reform in 1936, banks and industrial companies in italy were strongly intertwined (both in terms of ownership and interlocking directorates). using imita.db-a large dataset containing data on over 300,000 directors of italian joint-stock companies-this paper analyzes what would have happened to the italian corporate network in the years 1913, 1921, 1927 and 1936 if the german-type universal banks and their directors would have not been there. our test shows that new centers of the system would have emerged (financial, electricity, and phone companies), confirming the interconnected nature of the italian capitalism. we also analyze two industries (textiles and iron and steel) characterized by different labor-to-capital intensities to check for sectoral differences. contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that local banks were important in funding both industries.
electrical_network	ever increasing nonlinear loads and supplies are changing dynamics of the electrical network. the levels of harmonics are on the rise and polluting more and more of the electrical network, posing new challenges before the designers and operators. to maintain the present power quality levels and to improve the performance of the electrical network, many control schemes and devices like active power filter 's have been proposed, but still an improvement is required. this paper proposes a five-level diode clamped multilevel inverter based distribution statcom (mli-dstatcom) with synchronous reference frame based control for harmonic mitigation. a three-phase four wire system with nonlinear, balanced/unbalanced load is designed and simulated in matlab/simulink for performance analysis of proposed mli-dstatcom. the results provide the evidence of restricting harmonic currents at load end and prevent from entering into source effectively. the performance of five-level, three-level and two-level dstatcom 's are compared under nonlinear, balanced/unbalanced load. simulation result analysis show superior performance of five-level diode clamped mli-dstatcom controlled using srf.
electricity	utilization of wind turbines to produce energy has been increasing in recent years, due to technology advancement, cost stability and environmental issues. in this paper, the wind resource and economic feasibility have been studied to avoid investment risk in cites of zabol, zahak, zahedan and mirjaveh in sistan and balouchestan province of iran. the weibull distribution function has been applied to estimate the wind power and energy density, using meteorological data. determination of coefficient, root mean square error, mean bias error and mean bias absolute error are also calculated to ensure the accuracy of the statistical analysis of fitted distribution. windographer software has been employed to investigate the prevailing wind direction. the estimated annual energy densities are 2495.36, 2355.69, 126524 and 1214.01 kwh/m(2)/year, and the annual mean power densities are 284.97, 269.02, 144.49 and 138.64 w/m(2). it is found that zabol and zahedan are suitable for large scale power generation. the results indicate that using dw61-900 kw wind turbines are highly beneficial for zabol and zahak, while for zahedan, dw52/54-250 kw wind turbine is more appropriate for generating electricity. however, mirjaveh is suitable for off-grid applications. it should be noted that in this analysis, monetary units are presented in 2016 u.s. dollar.

electric_motor	the present paper deals with the defect detection and diagnosis of induction motor, based on motor current signature analysis in a quality control scenario. in order to develop a monitoring system and improve the reliability of induction motors, clarke-concordia transformation and kernel density estimation are employed to estimate the probability density function of data related to healthy and faulty motors. kullback-leibler divergence identifies the dissimilarity between two probability distributions and it is used as an index for the automatic defects identification. kernel density estimation is improved by fast gaussian transform. since these techniques achieve a remarkable computational cost reduction respect the standard kernel density estimation, the developed monitoring procedure became applicable on line, as a quality control method for the end of production line test. several simulations and experimentations are carried out in order to verify the proposed methodology effectiveness: broken rotor bars and connectors are simulated, while experimentations are carried out on real motors at the end of production line. results show that the proposed data-driven diagnosis procedure is able to detect and diagnose different induction motor faults and defects, improving the reliability of induction machines in quality control scenario.

digital_control	the voltage source converters (vsc) are the key power interfaces between the individual ac grids and dc grids in the hybrid power system. when the ac grid is unbalanced, the grid currents are distorted and the harmonic is induced. meanwhile, the oscillations in the active and reactive power are also increased, which may damage these interfaces. in order to ensure the safety of the converters and the grid facility, a flexible control strategy is proposed for the ac/dc hybrid grid in this paper. at first, the current harmonic for the vsc is theoretically analyzed under unbalanced conditions. furthermore, the methods to separate the positive- and negative-sequence components of the ac grid voltages are summed up and analyzed. based on the theoretical analysis, different protected control methods are compared. a new control method, which can flexibly control oscillations of the active and reactive power by introducing a parameter k, has been proposed. the estimation of maximum current in each phase is discussed; meanwhile, the relationship between the voltage ripple on dc link and the parameter k is given. finally, the validity and advantages of the proposed method are verified by the simulating and experimental results.

analog_signal_processing	we derive a model for a wind turbine tower in the plane of the turbine blades, which comprises an euler-bernoulli beam coupled with a nacelle (rigid body) and a two-mass drive-train model (with gearbox). this model has two possible control inputs: the torque created by the electrical generator and the force created by an electrically driven mass located in the nacelle. first, we consider the case of only torque control and a possibly non-uniform tower. using the theory of coupled linear systems (one infinite dimensional and one finite dimensional) developed by us recently, we show that this wind turbine tower model is well-posed and regular on either the energy state space x-c or the domain of its generator on x-c, denoted by x-1(c). we also show that generically, this model is exactly controllable on x-1(c) in arbitrarily short time. more precisely, for every t >0, we show that if we vary a certain parameter in the model, then exact controllability in time t holds for all except three values of the parameter. in the case of using both force and torque control, we derive similar well-posedness, regularity and generic exact controllability results on a state space that is larger than x-1(c) but smaller than x-c. in this second case, we assume that the tower is uniform.
state_space_representation	resonant converters used as coil drivers in inductive links generally operate efficiently at optimum switching conditions for constant load values and ranges. changes in load and range can shift the operation of the coil driver to a nonoptimum switching state which results in higher switching losses and reduced output power levels. this paper presents a method to adapt to variations in range for a class e inverter used as a coil driver in a wireless power transfer (wpt) system based on inductive coupling. it is shown that by controlling the duty cycle of the inverter 's switch and the value of its dc-feed inductance, the class e inverter can be tuned to operate at optimum switching conditions as the distance between the coils of the wpt system changes. mathematical analysis is presented based on a linear piecewise state-space representation of the inverter and the inductive link. extensive experimental results are presented to verify the performed analysis and validity of the proposed tuning procedure.

microcontroller	this paper aims to develop a new method for identification of power quality (pq) events based on discrete gabor transform (dgt) with a finite impulse response window (fir-dgt) and type-2 fuzzy kernel-based support vector machine (t2fk-svm). the fir-dgt extracted features from the input signals and the t2fk-svm classified them. using proper window function for dgt is essential. iterated sine window was used as window function to extract the events' features. the iterated sine window 's function is four times faster than the default window function of dgt. kernel design is a main part of many kernel-based methods such as svm, so by using t2fk, the total accuracy of classification is enhanced. in the present work, use of this hybrid approach decreased the extracted features size, so the execution time and total required memory were optimized for the classification section. the simulation results revealed accurate classification and execution in the detection and classification of nine types of pq events. the overall accuracy of the proposed method was comparable to other methods and the accuracy evaluated under noisy conditions. hardware platform was developed for evaluating the proposed method based on arm lpc 1768 microcontroller to assess accuracy of the method in real conditions.
analog_signal_processing	slow light systems are particularly attractive for analog signal processing, since their inherent limitation to a delay-bandwidth product of 1 is less critical for analog systems such as those used in microwave photonics. we present here the implementation of two basic functions - phase shifting and true time delaying - fully optically controlled using stimulated brillouin scattering in optical fibers. the combination of these two functions makes possible the implementation of true time delays without limitation on the microwave carrier frequency using the separate carrier tuning technique. this is illustrated by the implementation of the delaying system for the realization of a microwave tunable notch filter.
system_identification	a methodology is proposed to update mechanics-based nonlinear finite element (fe) models of civil structures subjected to unknown input excitation. the approach allows to jointly estimate unknown time-invariant model parameters of a nonlinear fe model of the structure and the unknown time histories of input excitations using spatially-sparse output response measurements recorded during an earthquake event. the unscented. kalman filter, which circumvents the computation of fe response sensitivities with respect to the unknown model parameters and unknown input excitations by using a deterministic sampling approach, is employed as the estimation tool. the use of measurement data obtained from arrays of heterogeneous sensors, including accelerometers, displacement sensors, and strain gauges is investigated. based on the estimated fe model parameters and input excitations, the updated nonlinear fe model can be interrogated to detect, localize, classify, and assess damage in the structure. numerically simulated response data of a three-dimensional 4-story 2-by-1 bay steel frame structure with six unknown model parameters subjected to unknown bi-directional horizontal seismic excitation, and a three-dimensional 5-story 2-by-1 bay reinforced concrete frame structure with nine unknown model parameters subjected to unknown bi-directional horizontal seismic excitation are used to illustrate and validate the proposed methodology. the results of the validation studies show the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm to jointly estimate unknown fe model parameters and unknown input excitations.

electrical_network	optimal microgrid design is a challenging problem, especially for multi-energy microgrids with electricity, heating, and cooling loads as well as sources, and multiple energy carriers. to address this problem, this paper presents an optimization model formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which determines the optimal technology portfolio, the optimal technology placement, and the associated optimal dispatch, in a microgrid with multiple energy types. the developed model uses a multi-node modeling approach (as opposed to an aggregate single-node approach) that includes electrical power flow and heat flow equations, and hence, offers the ability to perform optimal siting considering physical and operational constraints of electrical and heating/cooling networks. the new model is founded on the existing optimization model der-cam, a state-of-the-art decision support tool for microgrid planning and design. the results of a case study that compares single-node vs. multi-node optimal design for an example microgrid show the importance of multi-node modeling. it has been shown that single-node approaches are not only incapable of optimal der placement, but may also result in sub-optimal der portfolio, as well as underestimation of investment costs. published by elsevier ltd.
state_space_representation	the aim of the paper is to present a design procedure of the optimal controller minimizing the h-2-type norm of discrete-time stochastic linear systems with periodic coefficients simultaneously affected by a nonhomogeneous but periodic markov chain and state and control multiplicative white noise perturbations. firstly, two h-2-type norms for the linear stochastic systems under consideration were introduced. these h-2-type norms may be viewed as measures of the effect of the additive white noise perturbations on the regulated output of the considered system. before deriving of the state space representation of the optimal controller, some useful formulae of the two h-2-type norms were obtained. these formulae are expressed in terms of periodic solutions of some suitable linear equations and are derived in the absence of some additional assumptions regarding the markov chain other than the periodicity of the sequence of the transition probability matrices. further, it is shown that the optimal h-2 controller depends on the stabilizing solutions of some specific systems of coupled riccati equations, which generalize the well-known control and filtering equations from linear time invariant case. for the readers convenience, the paper presents iterative numerical algorithms for the computations of the stabilizing solutions of these riccati type systems. the theoretical developments are illustrated by numerical examples. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
system_identification	in this paper, a novel approach was proposed to increase the confidence of active slip system identification in polycrystalline metals. the approach takes advantage of microscale deformation tracking via digital image correlation (dic) combined with scanning electron microscopy (sem). the experimentally-obtained high-resolution deformation fields were mapped to an undeformed configuration, which gives slip traces suitable for comparison with undeformed crystal orientation data. a metric, named herein as the 'relative displacement ratio' (rdr), is calculated from the displacement fields near slip traces to characterize the localized deformation due to slip. in validation cases, the experimentally-measured rdrs matched well with rdrs theoretically-calculated from active slip systems. in test cases, active slip system identification by incorporating rdr as an additional constraint was demonstrated to be preferable to using schmid factor alone as a constraint. the proposed approach supplements existing techniques for slip system identification with increased confidence.
state_space_representation	in this paper, a new identification method for large heterogeneous spatially interconnected systems is presented. a string of different systems in state-space representation is considered. the proposed algorithm optimizes the output-error of the global system by using the steepest-descent and the gauss-newton methods. the main contribution of this work is that both the jacobian and the hessian matrix can be entirely captured by using sequentially semi-separable (sss) matrices. therefore, all the computations in the optimization routine can be performed with complexity that is linear in the number of subsystems. this fact permits to obtain models for large interconnected systems at low computational cost. finally, a numerical example is presented in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
system_identification	this paper describes the development, implementation and experimental investigation of a hybrid model predictive control (hmpc) strategy to control solar-assisted heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (hvac) systems with on-site thermal energy generation and storage. a comprehensive approach to the thermal energy management of a residential building is presented to optimise the scheduling of the available thermal energy resources to meet a comfort objective. the system has a hybrid nature with both continuous variables and discrete, logic-driven operating modes. the proposed control strategy is organized in two hierarchical levels. at the high-level, an hmpc controller with a 24-h prediction horizon and a 1-h control step is used to select the operating mode of the hvac system. at the low-level, each operating mode is optimised using a 1-h rolling prediction horizon with a 5-min control step. the proposed control strategy has been practically implemented on the building management and control system (bmcs) of a net zero-energy solar decathlon house. this house features a sophisticated hvac system comprising of an air-based photovoltaic thermal (pvt) collector and a phase change material (pcm) thermal storage integrated with the air-handling unit (ahu) of a ducted reverse-cycle heat pump system. the simulation and experimental results demonstrated the high performance achievable using an hmpc approach to optimising complex multimode hvac systems in residential buildings, illustrating efficient selection of the appropriate operating modes to optimally manage thermal energy of the house.

electricity	vibration energy harvesting converts mechanical energy from ambient sources to electricity to power remote sensors. compared to linear resonators that have poor performance away from their natural frequency, nonlinear vibration energy harvesters perform better because they use vibration energy over a broader spectrum. we present a hybrid nonlinear energy harvester that combines bi-stability with internal resonance to increase the frequency bandwidth. a two-fold increase in the frequency bandwidth can be obtained compared to a bi-stable system with fixed magnets. the harvester consists of a piezoelectric cantilever beam carrying a movable magnet facing a fixed magnet. a spring allows the magnet to move along the beam and it provides an extra stored energy to further increase the amplitude of vibration acting as a mechanical amplifier. an electromechanically coupled mathematical model of the system is presented to obtain the dynamic response of the cantilever beam, the movable magnet and the output voltage. the perturbation method of multiple scales is applied to solve these equations and obtain approximate analytical solutions. the effects of various system parameters on the frequency responses are investigated. the numerical approaches of the long time integration (runge-kutta method) and the shooting technique are used to verify the analytical results. the results of this study can be used to improve efficiency in converting wasted mechanical vibration to useful electrical energy by broadening the frequency bandwidth.

operational_amplifier	the objective of this work is to minimize testing cost of analog and rf circuits for which complete specification tests are available. we use an integer linear program (ilp) to eliminate as many tests as possible without exceeding the required defect level. the method leverages correlation among specifications, thereby avoiding the tests for specifications that are sufficiently covered by tests for other specifications. first, monte carlo simulation determines probabilities for each test covering all other specifications it was not originally intended for. these probabilities and the given defect level then define an ilp model for eliminating unnecessary tests. an hypothetical example illustration of ten specifications demonstrates that depending on the defect level requirement up to half of the tests may be eliminated. monte carlo simulation using spice for probabilistic characterization of tests versus specifications followed by ilp optimization for two commercially available integrated circuits, an operational amplifier and a radio frequency power controller (rfpc), are presented as evidence of effectiveness of the technique.

electrical_circuits	electrical circuits are difficult to understand. novices tend to have inadequate understandings of what happens at the level of atoms and electrons, leading to difficulty predicting the outcomes of electrical circuits at the level of wires, resistors, and light bulbs. in this paper, we argue that integrating micro and macro representations of an electrical circuit can provide students with a better understanding of fundamental concepts of electricity. we then introduce spark, an interactive multi-level simulation environment that enables learners to interact with representations of electrical circuit at both levels. the primary goal of our design is to familiarize students with electrical current, resistance, and potential difference in a circuit. we conducted a study with 17 university students that shows the ability of our design to improve novice understanding of electrical circuits. our study offers evidence that learners are able to develop better understandings of fundamental concepts of electricity drawing on both micro-level and macro-level representations of an electrical circuit.
state_space_representation	this work presents a novel variable speed generator system, i.e. double-generator system for the hydropower plants. it consists of two synchronous machines, a superposition gearbox and an inverter. one of the synchronous machines is coupled directly to the grid and the other is connected to the inverter. the stabilization of the system and the regulation of the turbine desired speed are achieved by the control of the latter synchronous machine. due to its specific construction the investment of hydropower plants can be reduced. the dynamic behavior e.g. the step responses characterizes the system properties. firstly, the equations, which describe the total system, are presented. then these equations are linearized at an operating point, so that the controller can be designed. finally, the stability of the system and the control behavior are examined with the method of state space representation.
electricity	green energy has gained significant research attention across the globe due to its ability to reduce environmental damage. however, for complete acceptance of green energy, only government regulations are not enough; the willingness to use green energy and contribute to the wellbeing of the environment should spring from within consumers. such willingness may be developed by enhancing consumers' perceived value of green energy. however, in order to do so, it is necessary to assess existing levels of consumers' perceived value towards green energy. the present study develops a multidimensional green perceived value scale to measure existing levels of consumers' perceived value. the scale considers green perceived value as a multidimensional second order construct comprising functional value, social value, conditional value and emotional value dimensions. such an attempt has not been made before which highlights the originality value of the present study. the scale can be used to assess consumers' perception towards green energy. such information would help in formulating strategies that encourage consumers to voluntarily adopt green energy. the study also reveals that it is not only the financial aspects that lead consumers to decide on adoption of green energy; consumers are also driven by emotional and social considerations. thus, policy makers could formulate pro-green energy programmes and mass messages that appeal to consumers' sense of responsibility to voluntarily adopt green energy without having to rely on financial incentives. researchers could examine the considered dimensions of the scale further with respect to other constructs related to consumer behaviour.

electrical_network	the electrical network measurements are usually sent to the control centers using specific communication protocols. however, these measurements contain uncertainties due to the meters and communication errors (noise), incomplete metering or unavailability of some of these measurements. the aim of state estimation is to estimate the state variables of the power system by minimizing all measurement errors available at the control center. in the past, many traditional algorithms, based on gradient approach, have been used for this purpose. this paper discusses the application of an artificial intelligence (ai) algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (pso), to solve the state estimation problem within a power system. two objective functions are formulated: the weighted least square (wls) and weighted least absolute value (wlav). the effectiveness of pso over another ai optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm (ga), is shown by comparing both two solutions to the true state variable values obtained using newton-raphson (nr) algorithm.

state_space_representation	this study introduces power quality (pq) state space representation to describe continuous pq disturbances. a tolerance boundary is designed to represent the integrated disturbance tolerance of all equipment connected to electric power network, and the uncertainty of integrated disturbance tolerance is described with the cloud model. electromagnetic compatibility and incompatibility degree indices are proposed to reflect the severity of pq disturbances affecting the equipment. the influence degree index is defined to quantify the severity and impact scope of pq disturbances. the uncertainty of equipment fault state is expressed by a fuzzy membership function. subsequently, pq performance is assessed according to equipment compatibility/incompatibility degree to pq disturbances. case studies on a 14-bus distribution system are performed and analysed. results reveal the effectiveness and reasonableness of the proposed indices in assessing equipment compatibility/incompatibility degree to pq disturbances, influence of pq disturbances on the equipment, and pq performance.
digital_control	the main tendency of rolling mills drives modernization is outdated analog control systems replacement with new digital ones. at the same time, a power section of the drive remains the same. this gives an opportunity to develop and implement adaptive digital control system for such plants in order to take into consideration their high nonlinearity. having considered different types of such systems, the ones which does not change the well-accepted pid control algorithm, but tune its parameters kp, ki, kd are believed to have the highest chances to be applied into industry. the main aim of this research is to develop and apply a neural tuner to adjust armature current pi-controller parameters of a two-high reversing rolling mill drive online. the neural tuner consists of 1) a neural network calculating kp and ki values and trained online with the help of backpropagation method and 2) a rule base, which conditions is used to estimate transient quality, whereas consequences are values of a learning rate of the network output layer neurons. modeling experiments are conducted with a model of the plant under consideration. they are used to check the ability of the tuner to: 1) adjust the pi-controller parameters back to optimal values; 2) cope with an armature winding parameters drift. such experiments are conducted both for the systems with the neural tuner and a conventional pi-controller. as far as the second type of experiments is concerned, the system with the neural tuner is able to achieve 2% energy consumption decrease comparing to a conventional pi-controller based control system.
electrical_circuits	a new concept of an electrical shunt with different materials (aluminum and copper) has been developed to be used as an alternative current measurement device. the device provides better current measurement characteristics compared with the conventional current measurement devices such as a shunt resistor with an ammeter or the multiple shunts consisting of molybdenum having a low temperature coefficient and a rogowski coil with an integrated circuit. the currents in several electrical circuits have been measured using the developed current-voltage transferring device (cvtd) as voltages between the aluminum and copper elements. the measured voltages (v-m) are proportional to measuring currents (i-m), which is shown as the following the experimental equation v-m [mv] =ki(m) [a], in which k is a coefficient depending on the configuration of the cvtd.

pid_controller	force sensing and control are of paramount importance in robotic micromanipulation. a contact force regulator capable of accurately applying mechanical stimuli to a live drosophila larva could greatly facilitate mechanobiology research on drosophila and may eventually lead to novel discoveries in mechanotransduction mechanisms of neuronal circuitries. in this paper, we present a novel contact force control scheme implemented in an automated drosophila larvae micromanipulation system, featuring a switched fuzzy to proportional-differential (pd) controller and a noise-insensitive extended high gain observer (ehgo). the switched fuzzy-pd control law inherits the fast convergence of fuzzy control and overcomes its drawbacks such as large overshoot and steady-state oscillation. the noise-insensitive ehgo can reliably estimate system modeling errors and is robust to force measurement noises, which is advantageous over conventional high gain observers (sensitive to signal noises). force control experiments show that, compared to a proportional-integral-differential (pid) controller, this new force control scheme significantly enhances the system dynamic performance in terms of rising time, overshoot, and oscillation. the developed robotic system and the force control scheme will be applied to mechanical stimulation and fluorescence imaging of drosophila larvae for identifying new mechanotransduction mechanisms.
electrical_network	the reduction of emissions in harbours is of particular importance due to the proximity to human habitation. vessels normally run onboard generators, typically using diesel fuel, to provide the service loads while berthed. new and upcoming regulations aim to decrease emissions from shipping, and coupled with increased environmental consciousness of ship owners and harbour operators, shore supply is becoming a more popular and feasible option. cold ironing provides an alternative locally emission-free solution by having berthed ships plug in to the shore electrical network, such that the onboard electrical energy demand is supplied from land. electrically, a number of different shore network topologies are possible, providing different infrastructural options of supplying power to multiple berths. this paper examines the electrical characteristics of one such installation and the impact on the shoreside electrical network for an existing port using actual visiting ship power profiles. the paper examines how the cold ironing system influences important electrical network characteristics such as bus voltages and power quality, as well as the potential impact on the rest of the utility distribution system.

system_identification	this paper concerns the problem of dynamic modelling and parameter estimation for a seven degree of freedom hydraulic manipulator. the laboratory example is a dual-manipulator mobile robotic platform used for research into nuclear decommissioning. in contrast to earlier control model-orientated research using the same machine, the paper develops a nonlinear, mechanistic simulation model that can subsequently be used to investigate physically meaningful disturbances. the second contribution is to optimise the parameters of the new model, i.e. to determine reliable estimates of the physical parameters of a complex robotic arm which are not known in advance. to address the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the research relies on the multi-objectivisation of an output error single-performance index. the developed algorithm utilises a multi-objective genetic algorithm (ga) in order to find a proper solution. the performance of the model and the ga is evaluated using both simulated (i.e. with a known set of 'true' parameters) and experimental data. both simulation and experimental results show that multi-objectivisation has improved convergence of the estimated parameters compared to the single-objective output error problem formulation. this is achieved by integrating the validation phase inside the algorithm implicitly and exploiting the inherent structure of the multi-objective ga for this specific system identification problem.
operational_amplifier	a signal- and transient-current boosting (stcb) circuit is proposed and applied to a single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. the proposed stcb circuit provides gain-bandwidth product (gbw) extension, slew-rate (sr) improvement and gain enhancement to the amplifier, with only slight alterations to the frequency response and transient response of the single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. no on-chip capacitor or resistor is required. the stcb amplifier is fabricated in a commercial 0.18-mu m cmos technology. the active chip area is 0.00705 mm(2). the supply is 1.8 v, and the current consumption is 20.3 mu a. the capacitive load (c-o) ranges from about 4.4 nf to 19 nf. the measured results with a similar to 19-nf load show the small-signal figure-of-merit (foms = gbw . c-o/power) and the large-signal large-figure-of-merit (foml = sr . c-o/power) are 150345 mhz . pf/mw and 31213 v/mu s . pf/mw, respectively, which correspond to improvements of 1.52 times and 1.36 times, respectively, to the prior art. the achieved phase margin and gain margin are 80.8 degrees and 36.3 db, respectively.
pid_controller	this paper deals with design of pid controller with the use of methods of global optimization implemented in matlab environment and optimization toolbox. it is based on minimization of a chosen integral criterion with respect to additional requirements on control quality such as overshoot, phase margin and limits for manipulated value. the objective function also respects user-defined weigh coefficients for its particular terms for a different penalization of individual requirements that often clash each other such as for example overshoot and phase margin. the described solution is designated for continuous linear time-invariant static systems up to 4th order and thus efficient for the most of real control processes in practice.
system_identification	sparse signal reconstruction (ssr) problems based on compressive sensing (cs) arise in a broad range of application fields. among these are the so-called ""block-structured"" or ""block sparse"" signals with nonzero atoms occurring in clusters that occur frequently in natural signals. to make block-structured sparsity use more explicit, many block-structure-based ssr algorithms, such as convex optimization and greedy pursuit, have been developed. convex optimization algorithms usually pose a heavy computational burden, while greedy pursuit algorithms are overly sensitive to ambient interferences, so these two types of block-structure-based ssr algorithms may not be suited for solving large-scale problems in strong interference scenarios. sparse adaptive filtering algorithms have recently been shown to solve large-scale cs problems effectively for conventional vector sparse signals. encouraged by these facts, we propose two novel block-structure-based sparse adaptive filtering algorithms, i.e., the ""block zero attracting least mean square"" (bza-lms) algorithm and the ""block l(0)-norm lms"" (bl0-lms) algorithm, to exploit their potential performance gain. experimental results presented demonstrate the validity and applicability of these proposed algorithms.
system_identification	this study focuses on a discrete-time hammerstein system to investigate the identification with quantised inputs and quantised output observations. after the discussion of the system identifiability and by parameterising the static non-linear function, a three-step algorithm is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters for the identifiable system. the strong convergence and the mean-square convergence rate of the algorithm are established. it is shown that the asymptotic efficiency can be achieved in terms of the cramer-rao lower bound by selecting a suitable transformation matrix. a numerical simulation is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
electrical_circuits	in this letter we report patterning of colloidal nanocrystal films that combines direct e-beam (electron beam) writing with cation exchange. the e-beam irradiation causes cross-linking of the ligand molecules present at the nanocrystal surface, and the cross-linked molecules act as a mask for further processing. consequently, in the following step of cation exchange, which is performed by directly dipping the substrate in a solution containing the new cations, the regions that have not been exposed to the electron beam are chemically transformed, while the exposed ones remain unchanged. this selective protection allows the design of patterns that are formed by chemically different nanocrystals, yet in a homogeneous nanocrystal film. spatially resolved compositional analysis by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (eds) corroborates that the selective exchange occurs only in the nonirradiated regions. we demonstrate the utility of this lithography approach by fabricating conductive wires and luminescent patterns in cdse/cds nanocrystal films by converting nonirradiated regions to cu2-xse/cu2-xs. furthermore, we show that x-ray irradiation too can lead to protection from cation exchange.
digital_control	efficiency in a light load dc-dc converter is improved by reducing the switching frequency with the load current. further, a bifrequency operation (bfo) using pulse train (pt) control can achieve spread spectrum. using discrete-time models, this paper shows that a stable periodic bfo is generally not achievable in existing pt control methods. thereafter, a unified multimode digital control technique is proposed, in which a voltage-mode digital pulse-width-modulator (dpwm) is used to control a predefined periodic bfo. beside the fixed-frequency dpwm, an extra multiplexer is considered for real-time configuration to: 1) bifrequency pulse frequency modulation; 2) pt control; or 3) pulse regulation control; or 4) pulse skipping control with smooth transition. analysis and design methods are discussed to ensure periodic bfo and to customize the power spectrum with predictable ripple parameters. a buck converter prototype is made, and the proposed control is implemented using an fpga device.
pid_controller	to meet the more stringent environmental requirements of automobile exhaust gas emissions, diesel engines have recently received increased attention due to their high heat efficiency. to lower fuel consumption and reduce exhaust gas simultaneously, fuel combustion must be more precisely controlled. for example, the oxygen concentration, which affects emissions, is controlled by exhaust gas recirculation (egr) and variable nozzle turbo (vnt). however, realizing a controlled design is difficult due to system non-linearity and strong interference between egr and vnt. recently, various design methods have employed the so-called model-based control design, but this design approach is difficult to use when the controlled object is complex. currently, mass production uses gain scheduling of map-based on proportional-integral-derivative (pid) control, in which each gain is tuned at various operational points. however, map calibration has many drawbacks, including time-consuming tuning, difficulty tuning during transient operations and problems adapting to the individual variations in the engine characteristics. this study proposes a construction method for a model-free adaptive pid controller using the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (spsa) and its performance is confirmed in an engine bench test.
electricity	currently, the algerian energy system relies almost exclusively on fossil resources, but a new paradigm is emerging in the country. the algeria program on renewable energy and energy efficiency established the ambitious goal of deriving 40% of electricity production from renewable energy sources (res) by 2030. this study addresses the sustainability objectives of this program using a methodology, which combines an analytic hierarchy process (ahp) and experts' feedback to evaluate different renewable energy options. the performance of different res options was assessed against 13 sub-criteria reflecting social, environmental, economic and technical concerns. the results highlighted the importance of social and environmental criteria as the main drivers for the obtained final ranking, with three of these sub-criteria weighting 35% in the decision process. solar power was shown to be particularly well suited for algeria, outperforming most of the other renewable options in a large set of highly weighted criteria. wind power ranked second, followed by biomass, geothermal and lastly by hydropower. wind and solar power together achieved a total score of more than 0.5 out of 1. from the results, policy implications were drawn and directions for future research were suggested.

digital_control	in many digital control systems, it is required to perform computation in a strictly periodic fashion to provide high control performance. system designers need to assign time slots that are infinitely repeated given a strict period for each task such that the time slots of different tasks do not overlap. while previous work has studied how to decide if a system is schedulable with a certain time slot assignment, it is still an unexplored area of how to select time slots for strictly periodic tasks to make them schedulable. in this paper, we propose an efficient method to solve the above problem. our method explores the relations among task periods to improve the possibility of finding feasible start time configurations. finally, we conduct experiments with randomly generated workload to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

electric_motor	rapid changes in cross-polarization discrimination (xpd) of ka-band satellite radio wave signals caused by thunderstorm events are presented. their yearly statistics and yearly variations are discussed using the co-polar and cross-polar signals received for the past 17 years from 1990 to 2006. the number of thunderstorm events and rapid changes in xpd shows large yearly variations in a time scale of about five or six years. these long-term yearly variations may be related to periodic cycles of the equatorial climate, such as el nino and la nina, which tend to bring weak and strong convective activities, respectively, to the summertime weather in japan.
electrical_circuits	background: a laboratory-scale two-chamber microbial fuel cell employing an aerated cathode with no catalyst was inoculated with mixed inoculum and acetate as the carbon source. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis) was used to study the behavior of the mfc during initial biofilm (week 1) and maximum power density (week 20). eis were performed on the anode chamber, biofilm (without anolyte) and anolyte (without biofilm). nyquist plots of the eis data were fitted with two equivalent electrical circuits to estimate the contributions of intrinsic resistances to the overall internal mfc impedance at weeks 1 and 20, respectively. results: the results showed that the system tended to increase power density from 15 +/- 3 (week 1) to 100 +/- 15 mw/m(2) (week 20) and current density 211 +/- 7 (week 1) to 347 +/- 29 ma/m(2) (week 20). the samples were identified by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene and showed that initial inoculum (week 1) was constituted by proteobacteria (40%), bacteroidetes (22%) and firmicutes (18%). at week 20, proteobacterial species were predominant (60%) for electricity generation in the anode biofilm, being 51% rhodopseudomonas palustris. meanwhile on anolyte, firmicutes phylum was predominant with bacillus sp. this study proved that under the experimental conditions used there is an important contribution from the interaction of the biofilm and the anolyte on cell performance. table 1 presents a summary of the specific influence of each element of the system under study. conclusions: the results showed certain members of the bacterial electrode community increased in relative abundance from the initial inoculum. for example, proteobacterial species are important for electricity generation in the anode biofilms and firmicutes phylum was predominant on anolyte to transfer electron. r1 is the same in the three systems and no variation is observed over time. the biofilm makes a significant contribution to the charge transfer processes at the electrode (r2 and cdl) and, consequently, on the performance of the anode chamber. the biofilm can act as a barrier which reduces diffusion of the anolyte towards the electrode, all the while behaving like a porous material. the anolyte and its interaction with the biofilm exert a considerable influence on diffusion processes, given that it presents the highest values for rd which increased at week 20.
operational_amplifier	this paper presents an optimization-based design methodology for fully differential amplifiers (fdas) including the effects of real common-mode feedback (cmfb) circuits as constraints in the design flow. the sizing procedure is performed separately for the main amplifier and for the cmfb circuit, reducing the number of free variables and exploring the design space in a more efficient way. also, this methodology can be employed to design single and two-stages fdas whereas a second pole compensation scheme is necessary. in order to validate the proposed methodology, a two-stage fully differential amplifier with a no capacitor feed-forward (ncff) compensation technique was designed in 0.13 mu m cmos technology with a 1.2 v power supply. the presented results also include a pole-zero pair mismatch analysis and proposes a solution in order to compensate the generated pole-zero doublet that might affect the performance of the amplifier. we can show that this approach reduces the overall static power consumption while satisfying the design specifications.
electrical_circuits	the paper deals with a method for the simulation of stochastic responses at multiconductor transmission lines (mtl) with fluctuating parameters via theory of stochastic differential equations (sde). the mtl responses are formed by the sets of stochastic trajectories completed by corresponding sample means and confidence intervals. the mtl model is based on a cascade connection of generalized rlcg networks and a state-variable method is used to formulate basic mtl 's model equations. the boundary conditions are folded in via a modified nodal analysis (mna) enabling to consider an mtl as a part of arbitrarily complex lumped-parameter circuits. finally, a vector stochastic differential-algebraic equation (sdae) is formulated, and the implicit euler numerical scheme consistent with the ito stochastic calculus used. to partly verify the results deterministic responses were stated via other methods and compared with mean values of stochastic ones. all simulations were performed in matlab (r).
control_engineering	the central china power grid (ccpg) and north china power grid (ncpg) are connected together by a single ac ultra-high-voltage (uhv) transmission link. when suffering power disturbances, power oscillation with high magnitude and long period would happen on the uhv tie-line, which may affect the synchronous and stable operation of the interconnected two power grids. this study proposes a novel emergency control scheme for high-voltage direct current (hvdc) in ccpg to suppress the high peak value of the power oscillation. based on a two-machine equivalent model, the maximum rising slope of power oscillat`ion is used to predict the peak value of power oscillation and power disturbance which is used as the reference of emergency power modulation. simulation verification is carried out based on the full model of the ccpg and ncpg, using power system analysis software package. moreover, field test has also been carried out in ccpg. both simulation results and recorded wave curve show that the proposed hvdc emergency control scheme can effectively suppress the peak value under different power disturbances. this significantly improves the transient performance of the interconnected power system and the power transfer capacity of the uhv tie-line.
state_space_representation	in this paper,we propose an output observer design methodology for linear single output systems. it is shown that, among other potential applications, the proposed observer can be used for filtering and fault detection purposes. unlike traditional observers that are based on the the state-space representation of the system, the proposed observer design is based on the input-output representation of the system. the main advantage of the proposed observer is its simplicity of design and it has a lower order than the original system.

state_space_representation	we propose a deterministic fluid model for the operation of two tandem sip proxies in overload conditions. using our model, we categorize overload scenarios into several classes, gaining better understanding of sip overload. we then use the theory of lyapunov for system stability and characterize stabilizing sip overload control schemes over the state-space representation of a sip server. a simple lyapunov function is then utilized to build a proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller for performing overload control in a tandem system of sip servers. the proposed pid overload control algorithm is then evaluated using experiments showing it can successfully restore throughput close to maximum system capacity during overload. furthermore, we study the effect of overload detection lag on system stability showing that even a small delay in reacting to overload can postpone system stabilization by multiple minutes.

system_identification	identification of nonlinear structural system is an important but challenging task for structural health monitoring. due to the complexities of structural nonlinearities, it is hard to establish proper mathematical models for some structural nonlinear behaviors. moreover, only partial structural responses can be measured in practice; it is essential to conduct identification of nonlinear structural systems using only partial measurements of structural responses. to cope with these issues, an algorithm is proposed in this article for the identification of some model-free structural nonlinear restoring forces using only partial measurements of structural responses. first, an equivalent linear structural system is introduced for the identification of the locations of structural nonlinearities. then, a model-free structural nonlinear restoring force is approximated by a power series polynomial. the unknown coefficients of the power series polynomials together with other structural parameters are identified by the extended kalman filter so that the characteristics of the behaviors of the model-free of nonlinear restoring forces can be identified. some numerical examples including the identification of two nonlinear multi-story shear frames and a planar nonlinear truss with different structural nonlinear restoring forces are used to validate the proposed algorithm.
operational_amplifier	in this paper a high gain low noise op-amp has been designed. in designing of a high gain op-amp, for large values of coupling capacitor, gain will decrease. since our requirement was to increase the gain, so we have designed a three stage op-amp. our designed circuit provides gain of 78.4 db, which is very much larger than two stage op-amp. there is a trade-off between various parameters like phase margin, gain, slew rate etc. for example, to achieve larger values of gbw, pm will decrease. we have compared the results for two values of input common mode range. improvement in the designed circuit is done to achieve the desired gbw by recalculating the transistor 's w/l ratios and then simulating the results. gain bandwidth product of 176.9 mhz and phase margin greater than 60 degrees is achieved but at the cost of power dissipation and area. the op-amp is designed in gpdk 180 nm cmos technology.
system_identification	in this paper, the infinite-horizon robust optimal control problem for a class of continuous-time uncertain non-linear systems is investigated by using data-based adaptive critic designs. the neural network identification scheme is combined with the traditional adaptive critic technique, in order to design the nonlinear robust optimal control under uncertain environment. first, the robust optimal controller of the original uncertain system with a specified cost function is established by adding a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system. then, a neural network identifier is employed to reconstruct the unknown dynamics of the nominal system with stability analysis. hence, the data-based adaptive critic designs can be developed to solve the hamilton-jacobi-bellman equation corresponding to the transformed optimal control problem. the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is also proved by using the lyapunov approach. finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed control strategy.
electric_motor	we present a method of comparing data on habitat use and availability that allows availability to differ among observations. this method is applicable when habitats change over time and when animals are unable to move throughout a predetermined study area between observations. we used maximum-likelihood techniques to derive an index that estimates the probability that each habitat type would be used if all were equally available. we also demonstrate how these indices can be used to compare relative use of available habitats, assign them ranks, and assess statistical differences between pairs of indices. the set of these indices for all habitats can be compared between groups of animals that represent different seasons, sex or age classes, or experimental treatments. this method allows quantitative comparisons among types and is not affected by arbitrary decisions about which habitats to include in the study. we provide an example by comparing the availability of four categories of sea ice concentration to their use by adult female polar bears (ursus maritimus), whose movements were monitored by satellite radio tracking in the bering and chukchi seas during 1990. use of ice categories by bears was nonrandom, and the pattern of use differed between spring and late summer seasons.
operational_amplifier	this paper discusses the use of a low gain amplifier and a passive switched-capacitor (sc) network to enable the sc integrator function. the method is applied to a delta-sigma modulator to achieve high resolution as proved by the 65-nm cmos technology test vehicle. compared with the conventional operational amplifier (op-amp)-based sc integrator, this solution utilizes a low-gain open-loop amplifier to drive a passive sc integrator with positive feedback. since the open-loop amplifier requires a low dc gain and implements an embedded current adder, the power consumption is very low. power reduction for single bit is obtained by using passive feed-forward with built-in adder to assist the first amplifier. the low swing obtained at the output of the active blocks relaxes the slew rate requirement and enhances the linearity. implemented in 65-nm digital cmos technology with an active area of 0.1 mm(2), the test chip achieves a dynamic range of 91 db, peak signal-to-noise ratio of 88.4 db, peak signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio of 88.2 db, and a spurious free dynamic range of 106 db while consuming 73.6 mu w in a 25-khz signal bandwidth at 1 v supply, yielding a fom(walden) of 70 fj/conv-step and fom(schreier) of 176 db.
signal-flow_graph	the signal flow graph (sfg) nonlinear modeling approach is well known for modeling dc-dc converters and it is a powerful analysis tool for higher order converter systems. modeling, of several specific fourth-order dc-dc converter circuits have been reported using conventional state-space averaging. particular emphasis has been given, so far, only to arrive at any of the large, small-signal (ss) and steady-state models but not a generalized one. this paper gives the generalized sfg model of the fourth-order dc-dc converter topology that is useful for generating different types of fourth-order dc-dc converter circuits unified models. further, it is shown that the deduction of large, ss and steady-state models from these unified sfgs is easy and straightforward. all possible fourth-order dc-dc converter circuits from its generalized topology have been identified and an analysis of a few converter circuits is given here for illustration of the proposed modeling method. large-signal (ls) models are developed for different topology configurations and are programmed in simulink simulator. ls responses against supply and load disturbances are obtained. experimental observations are provided to validate the proposed modeling method.
operational_amplifier	new voltage-mode electronically tunable notch, bandpass, highpass and lowpass shadow filters are presented. the filters are built around the current-feedback operational-amplifier. in each case one or more of the parameters of the filter can be electronically controlled by adjusting the gain of an external amplifier built around the current-feedback operational-amplifier. contrary to the current-mode shadow filters where a summing junction must be used, no summing amplifiers are used in these voltage-mode realizations. experimental results obtained using the ad844 current-feedback operational-amplifier are presented. the results obtained confirm the functionality of the proposed circuits.
electricity	in the transition to renewable energy systems, fluctuating renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, plays a large and important role. this creates a challenge in terms of meeting demands, as the energy production fluctuates based on weather patterns. to utilise high amounts of fluctuating renewable energy, the energy system has to be more flexible in terms of decoupling demand and production. this paper investigates two potential ways to increase flexibility. the first is the interconnection between energy systems, for instance between two countries, labelled as cross-border interconnection, and the second is cross-sector interconnection, i.e., the integration between different parts of an energy system, for instance heat and electricity. this paper seeks to compare the types of interconnectivity and discuss to which extent they are mutually beneficial. to do this, the study investigates two energy systems that represent northern and southern europe. both systems go through three developmental steps that increase the cross-sector interconnectivity. at each developmental step an increasing level of transmission capacities is examined to identify the benefits of cross-border interconnectivity. the results show that while both measures increase the system utilisation of renewable energy and the system efficiency, the cross-sector interconnection gives the best system performance. to analyse the possible interaction between cross-sector and cross-border interconnectivity, two main aspects have to be clarified. the first part defines the approach and the second is the construction of the two archetypes.

digital_control	this work describes an electrical interferometer for contactless permittivity measurements working at 120 ghz. it was fabricated in a 130 nm sige process featuring an ft and fmax of 240 and 330 ghz. the on-chip system contains a 120 ghz vco with a tuning range of 7 ghz featuring a divide-by- 64 circuit to enable external pll operation. the subsequent buffer provides 7 dbm of output power at 120 ghz. additionally, the ic contains high-precision and high-resolution phase shifters based on a slow-wave transmission line approach with digital control for direct readout ability. a 120 ghz lna with 17 db gain and a power detector to provide dc output signals were realized on chip. it enables sample emulation capability by phase shift inducement in the measurement as well as a reference transmission line. in terms of phase detection, the system shows a sensitivity of 907.36 mhz/degrees.
control_engineering	elms and sawteeth, located in different parts of the plasma, are similar from a control engineering point of view. both manifest themselves through quiescent periods interrupted by periodic collapses. for both, large collapses, following long quiescent periods, have detrimental effects while short periods are associated with decreased confinement. following the installation of the all metal 'iter like wall' on jet, sawteeth and elms also play an important role by expelling tungsten from the core and edge of the plasma respectively. control of tungsten has therefore been added to divertor heat load reduction, ntm avoidance and helium ash removal as reasons for requiring elm and sawtooth control. it is therefore of interest to implement control systems to maintain the sawtooth and elm frequencies in the desired ranges. on jet, elm frequency control uses radial field 'kicks' and pellet and gas injection as actuators, while sawtooth control uses ion cyclotron resonance heating (icrh). jet experiments have, for the first time, established feedback control of the elm frequency, via real time variation of the injected gas flow [1]. using this controller in conjunction with pellet injection allows the elm frequency to be kept as required despite variations in pellet elm triggering efficiency. jet sawtooth control experiments have, for the first time, demonstrated that low field side icrh, as foreseen for iter, can shorten sawteeth lengthened by central fast ions [2]. the development of elm and sawtooth control could be key to achieve stable high performance jet discharges with minimal tungsten content. integrating such schemes into an overall control strategy will be required in future tokamaks and gaining experience on current tokamaks is essential.
digital_control	we have proposed the sensorless model control based on the static model equation of the dc-dc converter that is able to change the bias value corresponding to changes of the load current, the input voltage and output voltage. the sensorless model control can regulate the output voltage. on the other hand, the transient response of output voltage is not improved. therefore, an improvement of the transient response is carried out by adding the transient improvement function which changes a bias value drastically for a short time at the start of the transient state. the purpose of this paper is to indicate the parameter setting of the transient improvement function that improves the transient response by the simulation analysis under changing the circuit condition.
digital_control	this paper presents a fully digital-control soft start mechanism with coefficients ki optimization for dc-dc power converters. during the soft start phase, a ladder reference voltage steps up gradually to make inductor current ramp up smoothly and overshoot voltage is minimized with the proposed coefficients ki distribution. simulation results show that massive inductor current can be well avoided during the soft start process with the proposed soft start mechanism, which only occupies a chip area of 300umx120um.
microcontroller	this paper deals with the design and real-time implementation of an model predictive control (mpc)-based reference governor on an industrial-like microcontroller. the task of the governor is to provide optimal setpoints for an inner proportional-summation-difference (psd) controller. the mpc-based governor is synthesized off-line as a piecewise affine (pwa) function that maps measurements onto optimal references. to achieve a fast and memory-efficient implementation, the pwa function is encoded as a binary search tree. this allows the reference governor to run on a sub-millisecond scale even on a very simple hardware. the proposed concept is experimentally verified on a laboratory device involving a magnetic levitation system. here, the psd controller is responsible for controlling the vertical position of the ball in the magnetic field. by using the reference governor, control performance can be significantly improved and input/output constraints enforced in a systematic manner.
microcontroller	in this brief, a practical power optimization method that calculates the optimal power supply and body bias voltages, for a given target operational frequency and a temperature, is proposed and evaluated. the proposed optimization method is based upon a simple power model in which several coefficients for leakage power, switching power, temperature, and operational frequency are obtained from accurate real chip measurements. the calculated optimal-voltage settings by the proposed model can achieve minimum accuracies of 93.8%, 91.6%, and 79.5% for room-temperature, 50 degrees c, and 65 degrees c, respectively. since the proposed methodology is based on well-known power formulas, it can be applied to the latest fd-soi technologies.
operational_amplifier	this paper presents a chopper amplifier for precision current sensing, capable of handling common mode input voltages outside the supply rails. for high common mode rejection ratio (cmrr) and dc gain, the amplifier employs a three-stage topology with nested-miller frequency compensation. by using the chopping technique, a referred to input offset voltage of +/-90 mu v is obtained. to reduce the output ripples caused by the chopping technique the amplifier employs a notch filter. a cmrr of 123db has been obtained, considering a supply voltage of 5v, for a common mode input voltage range from 4v to 80v. the stability of the operational amplifier (oa) is ensured for a minimum closed loop gain of 20v/v.
analog_signal_processing	instrumentation amplifiers (ia) used in wearable biomedical monitoring systems have to satisfy several performance requirements, such as low-voltage supply and low-power consumption, enabling increased portability. in the same time, a very important feature is wide range parameter programmability. this paper proposes a solution to implement electronic gain programming into an ia. the proposed solution is developed around the current balancing concept. an electronically tunable transconductance amplifier is used for adjusting the ia voltage gain as a function of the transconductor bias currents. additionally, the proposed ia outputs a differential signal, useful for latter differential analog signal processing. simulation results validate the proposed ia.
state_space_representation	nowadays, as more systems are regarded to be complex, the processes to develop them are becoming more complex too. this increasing trend makes more effective analysis methods inevitable necessities. meanwhile, matriarchal tools are becoming the most prominent, this paper has tried to study a work transformation matrix (wtm) at the level of coupled blocks of activities (cbas). the neighboring matrices of such a wtm act as its information flow interfaces with other activities. it is shown how these are equivalent to some state-space representation matrices. the equivalency helps us to improve the analysis method for a set of cbas constituting the whole wtm. additionally, the concepts of powers of adjacency matrices and elementary dynamic properties of process as a system in modern control theory are brought together to analyze the behavior of activities in coupled blocks. by analyzing these properties in a case study, five heuristic are derived and proposed for improving the process through better preference and ordering of activities. effectiveness of these heuristics is tested by a simple discrete-time simulation for which results show 17% of time reduction for the case study.
system_identification	refrigeration systems exist in different branches of industry and are characterized as great energy consumers with considerable nonlinear behavior. several studies have promoted energy costs reduction and minimization of nonlinearities effects in such systems. model predictive control has been successfully used to stabilize processes in the presence of such nonlinearities; therefore, its application in refrigeration systems is considered promising. in the present study, takagi-sugeno models were developed and validated in order to predict the evaporating and secondary fluid temperatures (te and tp) based on the anfis technique (adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems) for a vapor-compressor chiller equipment. the prediction performance of resulting models was analyzed and accessed based on the variance accounted for criteria. these models were then used as the basis for prediction models in several generalized predictive controllers (gpc) denoted here as gpc-anfis controllers. different predictive controllers were designed for different local rules (fuzzy rules) and the global control action was assumed as the weighted sum of local controllers. experimental tests considered two distinct controllers, namely the gpc-anfis(te) (evaporating temperature control by means of compressor speed variation) and gpc-anfis(tp) (propylene glycol temperature control by means of compressor speed variation), were performed. the experimental tests for setpoint tracking (+/- 1 degrees c) considering 3000w of constant heat load showed satisfactory results with setpoint deviation around +/- 0.3 degrees c. therefore, the anfis technique demonstrated to be able to provide reliable predictive models to be used in generalized predictive control algorithms.
signal-flow_graph	a new framework on the representation of signal processing that considers multi-domain information flow of the signal is proposed. elementary information processing and their diagrams are identified to analyze the components of an algorithm, which is to be translated to the diagram. intra- and extra-domain relationships are represented as graphs that connect the corresponding domains by suitable mappings or transforms and corresponding emissions or absorption of information. various examples: convolution, wavelet filtering, projection imaging and coding in noisy channel; are presented to show the ubiquity and to illustrate the usability of the proposed framework.
pid_controller	the present work approaches a relatively new optimization scheme called ""quasi-oppositional symbiotic organism search (qosos) algorithm"", for the first time, to find an optimal and effective solution for load frequency control (lfc) problem of the power system. the symbiotic organism search (sos) algorithm works on the effect of symbiotic interaction strategies adopted by an organism to survive and propagate in the ecosystem. to avoid the suboptimal solution and to accelerate the convergence speed, the theory of quasi-oppositional based learning (q-obl) is integrated with original sos and used to solve the lfc problem. to demonstrate the effectiveness of qosos algorithm, two-area interconnected power system with nonlinearity effect of governor dead band and generation rate constraint is considered at the first instant, followed by the four-area power system showing the consequence of load perturbation. the structural simplicity, robust performance and acceptability of well-popular proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller enforce to implement it as a secondary controller for the present analysis. the success of qosos algorithm is established by comparing the dynamic performances of concerned power system with those obtained by some recently published algorithms available in the literature. furthermore, the robustness and sensitivity are analyzed for the concerned power system to judge the efficacy of the proposed qosos approach.
pid_controller	we present a prototype of 6-dof magnetically levitated stage based on single axis lorentz force actuator is capable of positioning down to micron in several millimeter travel range with a simple and compact structure. the implementation of the lorentz force actuators, instrument modeling, and motion controller of the maglev system are described. with the force-gap relationship of the actuator solved by gaussian quadrature, 2-demsional (2d) lookup table is employed to store the result for the designing of control system. based on the force-gap relationship, we choose the suitable stroke of each actuator to develop the stability of the maglev stage. complete decoupling matrix is analyzed here to establish a decoupled dynamics between resulting six axis motion and eight outputs to the actuators. the design travel volume of the stage is 2mmx2mmx2mm in translation and 80mradx 80mradx40mrad in rotation. with a constant gain and critical damping pid controller, the resolution of the translation is 2.8um and 4um root mean square in horizontal and vertical direction respectively. experimental results are presented to illustrate the positioning fluctuations, step responds and multi axis motion. some comparative tests are taken to highlight the advantage resulted from the accurate force-gap relationship, suitable stroke, and complete decoupling matrix.
electrical_network	the paper considers the study of the electromagnetic field of a synchronous generator based on the three-phase induction machine. the stand includes: a frequency converter, an induction motor, a synchronous generator, a three-phase rectifier, an active load resistance, power protection and inclusion industrial electrical network. the study provides an analytical solution to one of the main objectives within theoretical foundations of electrical engineering, formulated so to reflect the decision making while designing new types of synchronous generators with permanent magnets. the necessity for such generators is determined, above all, by development of the area of small-scale energy sector due to the emergence on the consumer market of affordable and accessible strong magnets of neodymium alloy ndfeb. the purpose of this paper is to obtain an analytical solution for the determination of the induced electromotive force (emf) in the loop placed in a magnetic field of the permanent magnet of rectangular cross-sectional shape while in relative motion. the pictures magnetic field of the generator in an idling mode, the transverse and the longitudinal armature reaction at the nominal current in the stator winding are presented in the paper.
digital_control	this paper addresses the self-interference (si) cancellation in a full-duplex radio transceiver. in particular, we focus on shared-antenna based full-duplex transceivers where the self-interference coupling channel is always frequency-selective and can also be strongly time-varying depending on the antenna matching characteristics and reflections from the surroundings. a novel digitally-controlled rf self-interference canceller structure is described, being able to process the signals in a frequency-selective manner as well as track adaptively the time-varying si features, stemming from the fast digital control loop. a complete demonstrator board is developed, reported and measured, incorporating both the rf processing and the digital control processing. comprehensive rf measurements are then also carried out and reported at 2.4ghz ism band, evidencing more than 40dbs of active rf cancellation gain up to 80mhz instantaneous waveform bandwidths. furthermore, real-time self-adaptive tracking features are successfully demonstrated.
lorentz_force_law	consensus on a single electrodynamic theory has yet to be reached. discord was seeded over a century ago when abraham and minkowski proposed different forms of electromagnetic momentum density and has since expanded in scope with the gradual introduction of other forms of momentum and force densities. although degenerate sets of electrodynamic postulates can be fashioned to comply with global energy and momentum conservation, hope remains to isolate a single theory based on detailed comparison between force density predictions and radiation pressure experiments. this comparison is two-fold challenging because there are just a handful of quantitative radiation pressure measurements over the past century and the solutions developed from different postulates, which consist of approximate expressions and inferential deductions, are scattered throughout the literature. for these reasons, it is appropriate to conduct a consolidated and comprehensive re-analysis of past experiments under the assumption that the momentum and energy of light in matter are degenerate. we create a combined electrodynamic/fluid dynamic simulation testbed that uses five historically significant sets of electrodynamic postulates, including those by abraham and minkowski, to model radiation pressure under diverse configurations with minimal assumptions. this leads to new interpretations of landmark investigations of light momentum, including the balazs thought experiment, the jones-richards and jones-leslie measurements of radiation pressure on submerged mirrors, observations of laser-deformed fluid surfaces, and experiments on optical trapping and tractor beaming of dielectric particles. we discuss the merits and demerits of each set of postulates when compared to available experimental evidence and fundamental conservation laws. of the five sets of postulates, the abraham and einstein-laub postulates provide the greatest consistency with observations and the most physically plausible descriptions of electrodynamic interactions. force density predictions made by these two postulates are unique under many conditions and their experimental isolation is potentially within reach.
operational_amplifier	in communication and computing devices, the growing demand for high performance, battery-operated portable equipments have transferred the concentration from staid constraints (such as area, performance and reliability) to power consumption. in the present scenario there is a cardinal requirement to diminish power consumption for non-portable systems where power dissipation and leakage current are censorious concerns. in vlsi circuits and systems, power dissipation is still censorious because the leakage occurs when device is in inactive mode. to reduce the leakage power and leakage current in finfet based operational amplifier, a new circuit technique called low power state technique is adduced in this paper. this approach reduces significant amount of power during active mode and also has an endowment of conserving the state in state retention mode 1. the op-amp electrical characteristics are obtained by employing cadence virtuoso tool for circuit simulation at 0.7 v input supply voltage. the simulated dc gain thus obtained is 65.4 db in the active mode. the proposed finfet based operational amplifier performance traits are studied and compared with the existing cmos technology at 45 nm scale. here, the effect of temperature variation on electrical characteristics of op-amp at 45 nm technology regime has been reconnoitered. furthermore, by employing low power approach, the enhancement in slew rate has been significantly attained. the simulation results are given and concluded.
operational_amplifier	monte carlo (mc) techniques are widely applied to check a design on its robustness and for estimating the production yield of integrated circuits. using standard random mc and the sample yield for estimation, a very large number of samples is required for accurate verification, especially if a high yield is desired. this can make mc extremely time consuming, but if the data follows a normal gaussian distribution a much faster yield prediction is possible by using the well-known c-pk method. we extended this specification-distance-based scheme for the far more difficult general non-normal case by three different means, ending up in a new generalized process capability index named c-gpk. first, we apply parametric modeling only to the specification-sided distribution part. this way any difficulties in distribution parts that actually have little yield impact do not degrade the model fit anymore. second, to improve the parametric model we introduce a new tail parameter t. third, to allow modeling of difficult asymmetrical, multimodal or flat distributions we also introduce a new reference location parameter instead of using the mean. an advantage of improving mc this way is that-in opposite to many other mc enhancements (like importance sampling)-the performance of the c-gpk is not negatively impacted by design complexity. we described the formulation of the c-gpk and derived confidence intervals using an advanced bootstrap scheme. we verified the performance against the sample yield and c-pk for a representative set of distributions, including real production data and mc data from the design of a cmos operational amplifier and other circuits.
control_engineering	a non-isothermal jacketed continuous stirred tank reactor (cstr) is extensively used in chemical as well as in other process industries to manufacture different products. the dynamics of non-isothermal cstr are highly nonlinear and open-loop unstable in nature. moreover, it may have parametric uncertainties, disturbances and un-modeled side reactions which may cause the reactor temperature to deviate from the reference value. this deviation may degrade quality of the product because the chemical reaction inside the cstr depends on reactor temperature. for such a nonlinear, unstable and uncertain process, designing a control scheme with the ability to reject the effects of disturbances along with a good reference tracking capability is a challenging control engineering problem. in this work, a novel robust sliding mode control technique named as improved integral sliding mode control (iismc) has been presented for uncertain non-isothermal jacketed cstr process. moreover, a variety of recently developed sliding mode control techniques such as classical integral sliding mode control (cismc) and super twisted algorithm based sliding mode control (sta-smc) have also been devised and compared with the proposed approach in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. a lyapunov based analysis has also been provided to assure the robust stability of the closed loop process. furthermore, in order to extend the state feedback approach to the output feedback scheme, two robust observers; high gain observer (hgo) and extended high gain observer (ehgo), are also designed for the very process. they have also been compared with each other and have been investigated for robust stability using lyapunov based approach. finally, an output feedback control scheme using iismc and ehgo has been presented and its performance has been examined and compared with the iismc based state feedback approach. the simulation results show that the proposed control scheme effectively rejects the uncertainties and disturbances without leading the process to instability and offers good reference tracking capabilities.

state_space_representation	leader-follower formation control of unmanned vehicles in the presence of limited sensing and communication is studied. it is assumed that the follower is equipped with an onboard tracker to measure relative kinematic parameters with respect to the leader. considering practical measurements obtained from the onboard tracker, a state-space representation for the leader-follower system is obtained, and by employing a state feedback controller, the relative angle and the relative range are regulated to desired values. then, by modeling of the tracker mechanism, the effect of the tracker dynamics and sensor measurement noise on the formation keeping are studied. simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed leader-follower formation control structure.

electrical_network	an alternative hybrid time/frequency domain approach to compute the periodic steady-state of an electrical network is presented. the network under analysis can include a variety of linear and nonlinear components, e.g., pv-buses, nonlinear reactors, and electronic devices. in the proposed approach, the linear part of the network is modeled in the frequency-domain (fd) via an equivalent input-admittance and all nonlinear components but pv-buses are resolved in the time-domain (td). the fd equivalent is interfaced to the nonlinear components via discrete fourier transform (oft) operations, accounting for harmonic and interharmonic frequencies. the interfacing voltage/current variables are solved through a global gauss-seidel procedure; pv-buses are solved via a local newton-type iterative procedure. it is shown that the proposed approach achieves faster computations than traditional hybrid methods due to (i) the compact fd equivalent representation of the linear part of the network and (ii) the gauss-seidel iterative scheme that avoids calculation and inversions of jacobians. a sample network is used to compare the proposed method with a newton-type solution scheme; the resulting waveforms are also compared with those given by the pscad (tm)/emtdc (tm) simulation software.

system_identification	this paper discusses the measurement of frequency response functions for various dc-dc converters. the frequency domain identification procedure is applied to the measured frequency responses. the identified transfer functions are primarily used in developing behavioral models for dc-dc converters. distributed power systems are based upon such converters in cascade, parallel and several other configurations. the system level analysis of a complete system becomes complex when the identified transfer functions are of high order. therefore, a certain technique needs to be applied for order reduction of the identified transfer functions. during the process of order reduction, it has to be ensured that the system retains the dynamics of the full order system. the technique used here is based on the hankel singular values of a system. a systematic procedure is given to retain the maximum energy states for the reduced order model. a dynamic analysis is performed for behavioral models based on full and reduced order frequency responses. the close agreement of results validates the effectiveness of the model order reduction. stability is the key design objective for any system designer. therefore, the measured frequency responses at the interface of the source and load are also used to predict stability of the system.

microcontroller	recording evoked potentials in un-anesthetized animals and people is a powerful technique to non-invasively measure the function of neurons. as such, the primary output neurons of the eye can be assessed by the pattern electroretinogram (perg). currently, electro-physiologic setups to perform perg or related recordings are costly, complicated, and non-portable. here, we design a simple steady-state perg system, based off an arduino board. the amplifier is built on a shield that fits over a microcontroller board, an arduino, which digitizes the signal and sends it to a computer that presents stimuli then records and analyzes the evoked potentials. we used the device to record perg accurately with a sensitivity as low as half a microvolt. the device has also been designed to implement other evoked potential recordings. this simple device can be quickly constructed and used for experiments in moving systems. additionally, this device can be used to expose students in underserved areas to research technology that they would otherwise not have access to.
state_space_representation	this paper aims at designing a nonasymptotic and robust pseudo-state estimator for a class of fractional order linear systems which can be transformed into the brunovsky 's observable canonical form of pseudo-state space representation with unknown initial conditions. first, this form is expressed by a fractional order linear differential equation involving the initial values of the fractional sequential derivatives of the output, based on which the modulating functions method is applied. then, the former initial values and the fractional derivatives of the output are exactly given by algebraic integral formulae using a recursive way, which are used to nonasymptotically estimate the pseudo-state of the system in noisy environment. second, the pseudo-state estimator is studied in discrete noisy case, which contains the numerical error due to a used numerical integration method, and the noise error contribution due to a class of stochastic processes. then, the noise error contribution is analyzed, where an error bound useful for the selection of design parameter is provided. finally, numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed pseudo-state estimator, where some comparisons with the fractional order luenberger- like observer and a new fractional order h-infinity-like observer are given.
electricity	active demand side response (dsr) will provide a significant opportunity to enhance the power system flexibility in the great britain (gb). although electricity peak shaving has a clear reduction on required investments in the power system, the benefits on the gas supply network have not been examined. using a combined gas and electricity networks expansion model (cgen+), the impact of dsr on the electricity and gas supply systems in gb was investigated for the time horizon from 2010 to 2050s. the results showed a significant reduction in the capacity of new gas-fired power plants, caused by electricity peak shaving. the reduction of gas-fired power plants achieved through dsr consequently reduced the requirements for gas import capacity up to 90 million cubic meter per day by 2050. the cost savings resulted from the deployment of dsr over a 50-year time horizon from 2010 was estimated to be around 60 billion for the gb power system. although, the cost saving achieved in the gas network was not significant, it was shown that the dsr will have a crucial role to play in the improvement of security of gas supply.

electrical_circuits	the crystal structure, the c-13 nmr spectroscopy and the complex impedance have been carried out on [cd-3(scn)(2)br-6(c2h9n2)(2)](n). crystal structure shows a 2d polymeric network built up of two crystallographically independent cadmium atoms with two different octahedral coordinations. this compound exhibits a phase transition at (t=355 +/- 2 k) which has been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (dsc), x-rays powder diffraction, ac conductivity and dielectric measurements. examination of c-13 cp/mas line shapes shows indirect spin-spin coupling (n-14 and c-13) with a dipolar coupling constant of 1339 hz. the ac conductivity of this compound has been carried out in the temperature range 325-376 k and the frequency range from 10(-2) hz to 10 mhz. the impedance data were well fitted to two equivalent electrical circuits. the results of the modulus study reveal the presence of two distinct relaxation processes. one, at low frequency side, is thermally activated due to the ionic conduction of the crystal and the other, at higher frequency side, gradually disappears when temperature reaches 355 k which is attributed to the localized dipoles in the crystal. moreover, the temperature dependence of dc-conductivity in both phases follows the arrhenius law and the frequency dependence of sigma(omega,t) follows jonscher 's universal law. the near values of activation energies obtained from the conductivity data and impedance confirm that the transport is through the ion hopping mechanism.

electricity	the rapid development of energy, electricity, and transportation industries has created a market for steel pipes; however, buried steel pipelines near high-voltage transmission lines and electrified railways often experience alternating current (ac) corrosion at the damaged coating of pipelines; such phenomenon is mostly due to the resistance between the capacitance and inductance coupling, especially for long-distance pipelines in parallel operation. ac corrosion can cause pipeline corrosion perforation and stress corrosion cracking (scc) in some cases, which has been a vital threat to the pipeline safety. in this work, the influence of ac on corrosion behavior of x80 pipeline steel was investigated in ns4 near-neutral solution by data acquisition technique, electrochemical test, immersion tests and surface analysis techniques. results show that with the increasing of ac density, corrosion morphology changed from uniform corrosion to localized corrosion with many pits. under the full ac interference, x80 steel occurred cathodic and anodic polarization which resulted in iron dissolution and hydrogen precipitation. the negative half wave ac would lead to hydrogen evolution and hydrogen induced anodic dissolution, the pits in x80 steel surface present sharp. however, under disturbance of positive half-wave ac, only anodic dissolution occurred and the pitting appeared spill shape and smoothly. under various ac waveform interference, the corrosion products of x80 steel surface were different. under full ac wave and positive half-wave interference, the corrosion products were loose, had have no alpha-feooh and occurred cracks; however, under negative half-wave ac interference, the corrosion products were denser and contained alpha-feooh which has protective effect on substrates.

electricity	in the design of nuclear power plants, various natural circulation passive cooling systems are considered to remove residual heat from the reactor core in the event of a power loss and maintain the plant 's safety. these passive systems rely on gravity differences of fluids, resulting from density differentials, rather than using an external power-driven system. unfortunately, a major drawback of such systems is their weak driving force, which can negatively impact safety. in such systems, there is a temperature difference between the heat source and the heat sink, which potentially offers a natural platform for thermoelectric generator (teg) applications. while a previous study designed and analyzed a teg-based passive core cooling system, this paper considers teg applications in other passive cooling systems of nuclear power plants, after which the concept of a teg-based passive cooling system is proposed. in such a system, electricity is produced using the system 's temperature differences through the teg, and this electricity is used to further enhance the cooling process.

microcontroller	we propose a new controller for dc-dc converters based on particle swarm optimization (pso). this new converter controller uses the pso optimization method to directly control, by itself, the output voltage of a boost dc-dc converter. in order to validate and qualify the proposed converter controller, we analyzed and implemented some variants of the pso algorithm, namely the standard pso and the global local best pso. the proposed converter controller was then compared with a variant of the classic pi controller with anti-windup, for different operational conditions. the three controllers compared in this work were implemented in the microcontroller tms320f28027 by using the code composer studio from texas instruments. the results show that the proposed controller exhibits better behavior in terms of settling time and overshoot. unlike most popular dc-dc converter controllers, the proposed controller does not require any sort of optimal parameter determination.

digital_control	performance of any digital control scheme applied to inverters, or any other power electronic structures, can significantly suffer due to time delays. these time delays can be linear and nonlinear. an example of a linear delay is the delay due to sampling, control calculation and application of the new voltage state, which results in a constant delay present in each control cycle. an example of a non-linear delay is the inverter dead-time, which is different depending on the selected switching state and the direction of the load current. both types of delays are well-known and are addressedin literature. at the same time, the known solutions result in significantly more complicated hardware and/or software implementations. introduction of mpc to power electronics gives a new and unique opportunity to compensate for both types of the delays in a clear and effective way. this can be done by including the delays, both linear and non-linear, in the model predictions. as an illustration, this paper presents an mpc-based design of closed-loop current control with linear delay compensation for voltage source inverters. the paper also proposes a variable rate mpc-based voltage modulator which combines harmonic suppression with inverter dead-time compensation. the main points of the paper are illustrated by extensive simulation and experimenal results.
electricity	efficient power management in smart grids requires obtaining power consumption data from each resident. however, data concerning user 's electricity consumption might reveal sensitive information, such as living habits and lifestyles. in order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving cube-data aggregation scheme for electricity consumption. in our scheme, a data item is described as a multi-dimensional data structure (l-dimensional), and users form and live in multiple residential areas (m areas, and at most n users in each area). based on horner 's rule, for each user, we construct a user-level polynomial to store dimensional values in a single data space by using the first horner parameter. after embedding the second horner parameter into the polynomial, the polynomial is hidden by using paillier cryptosystem. by aggregating data from m areas, we hide the area-level polynomial into the final output. moreover, we propose a batch verification scheme in multi-dimensional data to reduce authentication cost. finally, our analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient in terms of computation and communication costs, suitable for massive user groups, and supports the flexible and rapid growth of residential scales in smart grids.

electrical_network	the electrical response of nh2-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets composite materials under strain was studied. two different manufacturing methods are proposed to create the electrical network in this work: (a) the incorporation of the nanoplatelets into the epoxy matrix and (b) the coating of the glass fabric with a sizing filled with the same nanoplatelets. both types of multiscale composite materials, with an in-plane electrical conductivity of similar to 10(-3) s/m, showed an exponential growth of the electrical resistance as the strain increases due to distancing between adjacent functionalized graphene nanoplatelets and contact loss between overlying ones. the sensitivity of the materials analyzed during this research, using the described procedures, has been shown to be higher than commercially available strain gauges. the proposed procedures for self-sensing of the structural composite material would facilitate the structural health monitoring of components in difficult to access emplacements such as offshore wind power farms. although the sensitivity of the multiscale composite materials was considerably higher than the sensitivity of metallic foils used as strain gauges, the value reached with nh2-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets coated fabrics was nearly an order of magnitude superior. this result elucidated their potential to be used as smart fabrics to monitor human movements such as bending of fingers or knees. by using the proposed method, the smart fabric could immediately detect the bending and recover instantly. this fact permits precise monitoring of the time of bending as well as the degree of bending.
microcontroller	in this work, a novel electronic lock that can encode and decode optical signals, modulated using morse code conventions, was developed to build a smart home security system based on the internet of things (iot). there are five topics of interest in this research: (1) optical morse code encoder; (2) optical morse code decoder; (3) ambient light sensor circuit; (4) fuzzy controller; (5) cloud monitoring system. we take advantage of the light-emitting components as the encoder, which are readily available in hand-held mobile devices (e.g., smart phones) and photoresistors and a microcontroller as the decoder. by wi-fi transferring, even without a personal computer, real-time information about this lock can be uploaded to the cloud service platform, and helps users to ensure home safety on the remote monitoring system. by using the ambient light sensor and fuzzy controller in this novel optical morse code-based electronic lock, experimental results show that the reliability of this system is much improved from 65% to 100%. that means that it is highly resistant to different illumination conditions in the work environment, and therefore all functions, including coding, emitting, receiving, decoding, uploading and cloud monitoring, can work well. furthermore, besides the convenience and cost reduction, by incorporating traditional keys into smart phones, as a consumer electronics, our proposed system is suitable for users of all ages because of a user-friendly operation interface.
signal-flow_graph	the analysis, design and performance of a conductor-backed coplanar waveguide (cbcpw) moisture sensor are described. the sensor can be used to determine the moisture content (mc in per cent) in oil palm fruit and other agricultural products. the sensor consists of three parts-the coupling system representing the transition between the coaxial line and the cbcpw, the two-layer structures of the cbcpw and the sensing area with its semi-infinite three-layer cbcpw structure. a relationship between the scattering parameter s-21 or attenuation of the sensor and the moisture content of the sample has been developed. the reflection and transmission phenomena in the sensor structure can be represented by a signal flow graph and can be simplified by the use of non-touching loop rules. the calculation of s-21 is based on the quasi-transverse electromagnetic mode approximation. this work also studies the effect of the thickness of the protective layer and the size of the gap between the conducting line and the upper ground plane on the sensitivity and dynamic range of the sensor. close agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results is obtained. the sensitivity and accuracy of the sensors are about 0.5 db/mc and 1% (unit mc, wet basis), respectively. the sensor is suitable for development as a complete instrument and can be used for quality assessments of oil palm fruit and other agricultural products.
system_identification	statistical inference subject to nonnegativity constraints is a frequently occurring problem in learning problems. the nonnegative least-mean-square (nnlms) algorithm was derived to address such problems in an online way. this algorithm builds on a fixed-point iteration strategy driven by the karush kuhn tucker conditions. it was shown to provide low variance estimates, but it however suffers from unbalanced convergence rates of these estimates. in this paper, we address this problem by introducing a variant of the nnlms algorithm. we provide a theoretical analysis of its behavior in terms of transient learning curve, steady-state and tracking performance. we also introduce an extension of the algorithm for online sparse system identification. monte-carlo simulations are conducted to illustrate the performance of the algorithm and to validate the theoretical results.

operational_amplifier	in this paper a cmos operational amplifier is presented. a cmos operational amplifier is presented here which is operating at 2v power supply and 1microamp input bias current at 0.8micrometer technology using nonconventional mode of mos transistors and whose input is dependent on bias current. the unique behavior of the mos transistors in sub threshold region allows a designer to work at low input bias current. it also allows operating at low voltage. while operating the device at weak inversion results low power dissipation but dynamic range is degraded. optimum balance between power dissipation and dynamic range results when the mos transistors are operated at moderate inversion. in comparison with the reported low power, low voltage op-amps at 0.8micrometer technology, this op-amp has very low standby power consumption with a high driving capability and operated at low voltage. operating the device in moderate version is a good solution. also operating the device in sub threshold region not only allows lower power dissipation but also a lower voltage operation is achieved. the proposed op-amp is a simple two stage single ended op-amp. the input stage of the op-amp is a differential amplifier with an nmos pair. operational amplifiers, or opa-mps as they are more commonly called, are one of the basic building blocks of analogue electronic circuits. operational amplifiers are linear devices that have all the properties required for nearly ideal dc amplification and are therefore used extensively in signal conditioning, filtering or to perform mathematical operations such as add, subtract, integration and differentiation.

signal-flow_graph	linear isotropic dielectrics constitute an important class of linear systems. the paper proposes a novel approach for assigning a suitable structure to describe the dependence of the dynamic behaviour of linear dielectrics on an external parameter of influence. a signal flow graph approach is adopted to arrive at the most general system structure and its subcases. a complex plane representation is used to establish a relationship between the system structure and the pattern of the constant-frequency variable-parameter plots. the one-to-one correspondence between loci patterns and system structure provides a rational basis for the selection of a suitable system structure.
operational_amplifier	the first step to improving public health is by the assessment of vital signs, which are valuable indicators of overall health. in the present day there are a number of complex, albeit expensive instruments that can measure various parameters accurately. however, these instruments often tend to be bulky, expensive and difficult to operate. hence it is difficult to use these instruments in isolated locations such as rural or disaster stricken areas, for bedside monitoring or even in military camps. the objective of this paper is to introduce the concept of a user friendly modular system which can be used to monitor various physiological parameters efficiently. in the proposed system different sensing circuits are attached to a common microcontroller unit (mcu) which can be updated with the associated firmware. any general computing system such as a laptop is connected to the mcu via a usb-uart bridge. after the connection is established the controller starts sending data to the computer. a javascript is run on the laptop using open-source software called processing 2.0, which initiates a customized display of the various parameters using the incoming data. for data logging we store the serial data in text files. as proof of principle we have measured two parameters, namely the body temperature using the lm35 sensor and the heart rate using photoplethysmography. such a switchable system can be used as a tool to measure various parameters like oxygen saturation, blood pressure, ecg etc. on the computer screen.
state_space_representation	this paper develops a robust h controller for a pitching and plunging airfoil using the state space representation of theodorsen 's lift model employing the linear matrix inequalities method. both parameter uncertainty and the input disturbances are considered in the model. the existence condition for the robust h state-feedback controller is obtained using the lyapunov functional approach. in practical systems, it is difficult to obtain all the states of the model needed for the controller. thus, the observer existence condition is proposed to provide the states' information for the model. several examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controller and the designed observer.

system_identification	in this work, pa-6 nanocomposites containing different amounts of nanoclay (nc) were prepared using a corotating twin-screw extruder. in practice, it is hard task to identify the relationship between the extrusion process parameters and the tensile modulus of pa-6 nanocomposites by performing several experiments. one approach to map the relationship between the process parameters and the tensile modulus of pa-6 nanocomposites is the use of a non-linear system identification tool called the adaptiveneuro fuzzy inference system (anfis). in this study, to achieve high modeling accuracy and generalization capability, an efficient shuffled frog leaping (sfl) algorithm is proposed to learn all the parameters of the network. a multi-input single-output (miso) anfis model is constructed and learned to predict the tensile modulus of pa-6 nanocomposites. the anfis model is constructed, trained and tested based on a collection of experimental data sets. acceptable agreement has been observed between the experimental results and the predicted results by the proposed model. the statistical quality of the proposed model is significant due to its good correlation coefficient r-2 values >0.98 between predicted values and experimental ones during the training and testing phase. also, comparison results indicate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over the conventional reported methods due to its high approximation accuracy and good generalization capability.
electricity	renewable energy projects in korea have two avenues that provide subsidies to increase their financial viability. feed-in-tariffs (fits) offer cost based prices for renewable electricity to compete with conventional energy producers. the clean development mechanism (cdm) issues certified emission reduction (cer) credits that generate additional revenues, enhancing renewable projects' return on investment. this study investigated how these subsidies impact the financial returns on korea 's cdm projects. an investment analysis was performed on four cases including solar, hydropower, wind and landfill gas projects. revenues from electricity sales, fits and cers were compared using financial indicators to measure their relative contributions on profitability. results indicate that cdm is partial towards large scale projects with high emission reductions. moreover, conflicts with fit schemes can deter small scale, capital intensive projects from pursuing registration. the analysis highlights cdm 's bias for particular project types, which is in part due to its impartiality towards carbon credit prices. it also reveals that korea, a key benefactor of cdm, is susceptible to such biases, as demonstrated by the disproportionate distribution of issued cers. improving incentives for bundled, small scale projects, cer price differentiation, and excluding domestic subsidies during additionality testing are proposed as possible reforms.
electrical_circuits	the battery state of charge (soc) is an important parameter of the battery capacity state. it can only be indirectly estimated through measurable variables such as voltage, current and temperature. accurate estimation of soc is one of the key problems in a battery management system. a battery model based on equivalent electrical circuits has been used to describe the battery dynamics. the model has been experimentally validated using a laboratory test. the battery soc has been estimated in real time by means of two methods: luenberger observer and kalman filter. this paper presents a comparison between the two model based soc estimation algorithms.

lorentz_force_law	to facilitate the motion control of ironless planar motors with stationary circular coils, in this paper, a real-time model is proposed to predict the force and torque exerted on a magnet array. the force and torque are calculated with lorentz force law, which can be essentially expressed as the calculation of the volume integral. due to the symmetry of the circle, the force and torque generated by the coil will not change when the circular coil rotates around its z-axis. this characteristic is then significantly utilized in the calculation of the volume integral, and the integral in the real-time model calculation is independent of the position and the rotation angle of the moving magnet array. the calculation result of the numerical integrals can be considered as constants, and thus the real-time model in this paper can be computed quickly. finally, experiments are carried out to provide verification of the proposed real-time model. the computation time of the model on a digital signal processor system is <15 mu s, and the force and torque predicted by the model are rigidly consistent with the measurement data.
digital_control	design and implementation of a low cost grid-connected 5kva solar photovoltaic (pv) system is proposed in this paper. since the inverter is a major component of the pv system, the b4 inverter used in this paper reduces the total cost of the pv system. in order to eliminate the massive transformer, the pv system is connected to the grid through igbt switches. in addition to injection of active power into the grid, the b4 inverter can compensate reactive power and reduce harmonics of the nonlinear loads. a tms320f28335 dsp processor is used for effective control of the b4 inverter. various features of this processor enable the implementation of the necessary control algorithms. as a first step, the pv system is simulated and evaluated in matlab/simulink. in the second step, hardware circuits are designed and implemented based on the simulation results. the operation of the pv system has been evaluated under balanced, unbalanced, linear and nonlinear loads which proves its accuracy and efficiency.

microcontroller	wood is a widely used material in various applications where its dimensional stability is of practical interest in the design and performance of wooden materials. the change in geometry of wood depends upon the environmental conditions (such as relative humidity) as well as internal structure and composition of wood. this work presents a measurement technique and development of the associated system for the measurement of strain changes of wood samples with relative humidity. the developed system is capable of measuring the strain change and relative humidity (rh) with temperature compensation. the system comprises of strain gauge based strain measurement unit and rh sensor with its related signal conditioning circuit along with temperature sensor. the strain gauge signal conditioning is based on quarter bridge method with high precision resistors which is excited by an ac source. the whole system is centered on an 8-bit risc microcontroller (pic18f43k22). the built in 10-bit analog to digital converter (adc) is used to read the strain and ambient rh. the temperature is directly read from temperature to digital converter using zacwire (tm) interface. the measurement system is calibrated using a cantilever of stainless steel and is used for collecting and analyzing data of four wood samples. the uncertainties associated with the measurements are reported in the paper. experimental results obtained for a few wood samples are presented.

digital_control	this article presents basic concepts and recent research directions about the stability of sampled-data systems with aperiodic sampling. we focus mainly on the stability problem for systems with arbitrary time-varying sampling intervals which has been addressed in several areas of research in control theory. systems with aperiodic sampling can be seen as time-delay systems, hybrid systems, input/output interconnections, discrete-time systems with time-varying parameters, etc. the goal of the article is to provide a structural overview of the progress made on the stability analysis problem. without being exhaustive, which would be neither possible nor useful, we try to bring together results from diverse communities and present them in a unified manner. for each of the existing approaches, the basic concepts, fundamental results, converse stability theorems (when available), and relations with the other approaches are discussed in detail. results concerning extensions of lyapunov and frequency domain methods for systems with aperiodic sampling are recalled, as they allow to derive constructive stability conditions. furthermore, numerical criteria are presented while indicating the sources of conservatism, the problems that remain open and the possible directions of improvement. at last, some emerging research directions, such as the design of stabilizing sampling sequences, are briefly discussed.

electrical_network	among various nanofillers for composite systems, carbon-based fillers such as graphite, carbon fibers, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc. are attracting great attention in both academia and industry for the advent of highly integrated electronic devices. the objective in fabricating such composite materials is to obtain distinct properties evolved from the synergistic effects of the component materials that may be exploited for various applications such as electronics and optical devices. in the present work, polyurethane/graphite composites have been synthesized with the aim of using them for electromagnetic shielding applications. the polyurethane/graphite composites were prepared through an in situ polymerization method in the presence of graphite nanoparticles. the prepared composites were characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (tem), and x-ray diffraction techniques. the shifting of the major peak of graphite nanoplatelets (gnps) in prepared nanocomposites towards the left from 26.336a degrees d-spacing = 3.381 to 25.374a degrees d-spacing = 3.507 on a 2 theta scale indicates the intercalation type of dispersion in the prepared nanocomposites. this was further validated with the tem characterization. the introduction of gnps in polyurethane (pu) during in situ polymerization creates an electrical network in the resulting composite, which therefore makes it highly conductive. the prepared nanocomposite showed an electrical network at 2.2 vol.% of the percolation threshold in dc condition and a similar percolation threshold was found at 100 hz in ac conditions. the maximum conductivity found at 6.5 vol.% of filler loading was 0.01 s/cm. the resulting composites were evaluated for electromagnetic interference (emi) shielding at different filler loadings. the prepared pu/gnps composites were found to be highly effective with shielding effectiveness of 19.34 db, and with electromagnetic interference shielding materials at 0.9-1 ghz.
electricity	the present study focuses on measuring the effects of industrial wastewater disposed from thermal electricity power plant as by-product on the geotechnical properties of sandy soil and applying washing process to remediate the contaminated soil samples and measure the efficiency of washing technique. the disturbed sandy soil samples were obtained from al-kufa city located to the southwest of iraq and the industrial wastewater obtained from al-musayib thermal electricity power plant. the intact sandy soil was contaminated in the laboratory with four percentages of industrial wastewater (10, 20, 40 and 100%) calculated according to the weight of dry soil. the industrial wastewater is mixed with distilled water to constitute the solution used in the contamination process of soil through soaking the soil by this solution for 30 days. the study results showed that with increasing the percentages of the contaminant, there was a slight increase in both the liquid limit and particle size, while there was a significant increase in the optimum water content. nevertheless, a slight decrease was observed in the specific gravity, maximum dry unit weight, and void ratio, while, a considerable decrease was noticed in the angle of the internal friction and coefficient of permeability of soil. the proposed remediation technique ""soil washing"" is efficient, economical, and time saving when used to remediate sandy soils. after remediation, the results showed an increase in the cohesion, angle of internal friction and maximum dry unit weight. also, a slight increase was observed in the specific gravity, void ratio and permeability coefficient of remediated soil samples when compared with that of contaminated samples. the removal efficiencies of contaminant from soil were (97.63, 96.79, 96.58, and 93.87%) for the soil samples contaminated with industrial wastewater by (10, 20, 40 and 100%), respectively.
analog_signal_processing	renewable energy sources are likely to become essential due to continuously increasing energy demands together with the depletion of natural resources that are currently used for power generation, such as coal and gas. they are also advantageous in terms of their reduced environmental impact. here, the generation of electrical power from vortex-induced vibration (viv) of a cylinder is investigated numerically. the cylinder is free to oscillate in the direction transverse to the incoming flow. the cylinder is attached to a magnet that can move along the axis of a coil made from conducting wire. the magnet and the coil together constitute a basic electrical generator. when the cylinder undergoes viv, the motion of the magnet creates a voltage across the coil, which is connected to a resistive load. by lenz 's law, induced current in the coil applies a retarding force to the magnet. effectively, the electrical generator applies a damping force on the cylinder with a spatially varying damping coefficient. for the initial investigation reported here, the reynolds number is restricted to re <= 200, so that the flow is laminar and two-dimensional (2d). the incompressible 2d navier-stokes equations are solved using an extensively validated spectral-element based solver. the effects of the electromagnetic (em) damping constant xi(m), coil dimensions (radius a, length l), and mass ratio on the electrical power extracted are quantified. it is found that there is an optimal value of xi(m) (xi(opt)) at which maximum electrical power is generated. as the radius or length of the coil is increased, the value of xi(opt) is observed to increase. although the maximum average power remains the same, a larger coil radius or length results in a more robust system in the sense that a relatively large amount of power can be extracted when xi(m) is far from xi(opt) unlike the constant damping ratio case. the average power output is also a function of reynolds number, primarily through the increased maximum oscillation amplitude that occurs with increased reynolds number at least within the laminar range, although the general qualitative findings seem likely to carry across to high reynolds number viv.
electric_motor	the determination of the efficiency of an electric motor or an inverter in an electric vehicle requires power measurements on the ac side of the inverter. voltage and current signals arise there from the switching operation of the inverter and are therefore hardly bandlimited. the finite bandwidth of measurement devices, like sensors or adcs, yields to a bandwidth limitation of the measured signals. this limitation modifies the measured signals and has an effect on the calculated power. measurement uncertainty considerations require the evaluation of the relation between this bandwidth limitation and the resulting error in the power measurement. this relation allows then for evaluating the significance of the spectral components for the power calculation and the decision which components are relevant and must not be filtered out by a bandwidth limitation. this paper presents an evaluation method for determining the bandwidth limitation error and identifies critical quantities in a numerical study.
microcontroller	today the 3d reconstruction of faces is an actual task. it is being used in various fields, for example, in scientific research, in recognition, in video games and in the movie industry. one of the existing methods of reconstructing 3d models of faces uses stereo cameras. the reconstruction process usually consists of several steps: calibration of cameras, acquiring the depth map (disparity map) and the creation of the 3d model. in this paper a method of acquiring a depth map is proposed that can later be used for the reconstruction of a 3d model of a face. the proposed method was tested in a virtual environment- a 3d editor ""autodesk 3ds max"" was used to create a virtual scene containing stereo cameras and a human head. the proposed method was also tested using two ""visar"" cameras, and an ""arduino micro"" microcontroller. ""arduino"" software allows to ensure synchronization of cameras, when using the ""arduino micro"" microcontroller. the images are captured from the cameras by using the ""flycap"" program. since the initial images contain distortions, the first step of the algorithm is the calibrations of cameras. for calibration, similar points are found on both stereo images. these points are later used to calculate the degree of distortion, and the images are rectified accordingly. the rectified images are used to calculate the depth map. the depth map is created from the front half-tone images of faces.

signal-flow_graph	this paper presents a systematic development of steady-state, small-signal models of interleaved dual boost converter operating in a continuous current mode. these models are derived by employing the well-known signal flow graph method. this signal flow graph approach provides a means to directly translate the switching converter into its equivalent graphic model, from which a complete behaviour of the converter can easily be studied. steady-state performance, small-signal characteristic transfer functions are derived using mason 's gain formula. the bode plots of audiosusceptibility, input impedance, output impedance, and control-to-output transfer functions are determined and illustrated using matlab for different values of load resistances, duty ratios. small-signal frequency responses obtained from the signal flow graph method are validated with pspice simulator results. to validate the signal flow graph modelling equations, sample steady-state experimental results are provided. copyright (c) 2001 john wiley & sons, ltd.
operational_amplifier	we investigate analog single event transient (aset) generation in an lm124 operational amplifier using focused pulsed x-rays and 800 nm femtosecond laser pulses. we report improvements that have been made to the pulsed x-ray experimental apparatus which include normal incidence geometry and a high speed x-ray chopper that allows us to reduce the pulse repetition frequency of the synchrotron derived x-ray pulse train. the addition of the chopper allows us to measure asets that have long relaxation times. we show that asets can be generated through metallization on the lm124, and that for equivalent pulse energy incident on the part, the x-ray response from areas covered by metal (and inaccessible to the laser) are different than the x-ray response from areas with no metallization, i.e. ""metal-free"". we use the laser pulses to generate asets at the same metal-free locations of x-ray induced asets. the shapes of the asets generated by the two methods are compared. we use the differences seen from the two generation methods to estimate the charge generation/collection produced by the pulsed x-rays and then estimate what let this would correspond to for heavy ions. this work shows that pulsed x-rays can be used to characterize analog devices for single event effects.
state_space_representation	subspace-based model predictive control (smpc) is a combination of a result in subspace system identification with model predictive control (mpc) method. particularly, it uses the subspace linear predictor equation to predict the future value of the system in the mpc implementation, instead of the usual state-space representation. the recursive subspace identification which updates the estimation of the extended observability matrix online is presented here for a multi input- ulti output (mimo) system specifically for a nonlinear biological waste water treatment process. givens rotation is applied for recursive updating of qr decomposition of a matrix in this smpc. in smpc, the need to have an explicit state-space representation of the system is abolished, resulting in a control algorithm that performs system identification and controller design in a single simultaneous step. additionally, smpc algorithm will inherit the numerical robustness typical of subspace-based methods thus giving us an easily deployable control implementation in adaptive framework.
signal-flow_graph	in this paper, a design procedure for the realization of all current-mode biquadratic transfer functions is presented. the synthesis technique is deduced from a signal flow graph representation using current follower transconductance amplifiers (cftas). the proposed configuration has single low-impedance input and five high-impedance outputs, and comprises three cftas and two grounded capacitors. no passive resistor is required for the circuit realization, thus it is an active-c structure suitable for integration.
system_identification	identification of nonlinear block-oriented models has been extensively studied. the presence of the process noise and more precisely its location in the block-oriented model essentially influence the development of a consistent identification algorithm. this paper is proposed with the aim to localize the process noise in the block-oriented model for accurate nonlinear modeling. to this end, the response of a wiener-hammerstein system is theoretically analyzed, and the disturbance component in the output, caused by the process noise preceding the static nonlinearity, is shown to be dependent on the input signal. inspired by such a theoretical observation, a simple and new protocol is developed to determine the location of the process noise with respect to the static nonlinearity using an input signal that is periodic but nonstationary within one period. in addition, the proposed technique is promising to detect the type of certain static nonlinearity (e.g., dead zone and saturation). finally, it is validated on a simulated example and a real-life benchmark.
electrical_network	this paper deals with the electrical modeling of lithium-ion polymer battery, from complementary characterization tests. the first aim of this work is to understand the electrical behavior of this battery through experimentations in the same environmental conditions as the final application 's ones. the second goal of this work is to identify battery models with different precision levels and to implement them in specific models of the considered aircraft electrical network. in this paper, two equivalent electrical circuit models are presented: a quasi-static model, which is functional and sufficient for the electrical energy management in the aircraft; a dynamic model, which is behavioral and necessary for the analysis of the embedded network quality. the identification of their parameters is carried out with adapted characterization tests, such as chronopotentiometry at constant current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at different temperatures. the complementarity of these tests is particularly underlined in this paper because it is useful for the parameter identification. the results from model simulation and from experimentation are compared through a mission profile and are analyzed. eventually, this paper presents complete experimental data for a commercial 4.8 ah lithium-ion polymer battery including the temperature influence.

system_identification	due to intermittent and adulatory properties of wind energy, when large-scale wind farm connected to the grid, it will have much impact on the power system, which is different from traditional power plants. therefore it is necessary to establish an effective wind farm model to simulate and analyze the influence wind farms have on the grid as well as the transient characteristics of the wind turbines when the grid is at fault. however we must first establish an effective wtgs model. as the doubly-fed vscf wind turbine has become the mainstream wind turbine model currently, this article first investigates the research progress of doubly-fed vscf wind turbine, and then describes the detailed building process of the model. after that investigating the common wind farm modeling methods and pointing out the problems encountered. as wams is widely used in the power system, which makes online parameter identification of the wind farm model based on off-output characteristics of wind farm be possible, with a focus on interpretation of the new idea of identification-based modeling of large wind farms, which can be realized by two concrete methods.
electric_motor	the condition monitoring of an electric motor is critical to its stable and reliable operation. the consequence of a fault is the variation in output performance and changes in the input electrical signature. one of the most common methods of fault detection is by analyzing the input current signature but this often requires expensive sensors. the other symptom of a faulty machine is when it runs ""hot"" due to an increase in losses generated. temperature changes could be a useful indicator of the underlying fault. in this paper, a method of condition monitoring using temperature sensors embedded in an electric motor is presented. the components of electromagnetic losses generated are determined indirectly from temperature measurement in real time for a continuous drive cycle simulating normal and faulty operations. this is achieved through the inversion of the thermal model of the machine coupled with the application of a recursive parameter estimation method. using temperature measurement for condition monitoring is advantageous since temperature sensors are low cost and already embedded in the machine for thermal protection. however, application of the method to a faulty motor and evaluation of its effectiveness in fault detection will be reported in a future work.
state_space_representation	in this paper, the development of a novel controller for a bidirectional buck and boost converter is studied to implement an active capacitance. to this end, an averaging method is used to obtain a nonlinear state-space model of the converter in the continuous conduction mode (ccm) for buck and boost configurations, separately. these models are then combined into a state-space representation for the whole range of operation. using the obtained model, a controller is designed to track a desired input current based on the applied input voltage such that the circuit exhibits a capacitive effect between the input terminals. the converter along with its proposed control method is a suitable replacement for the commonly used electrolytic capacitors in different applications. simulation results are presented that demonstrate performance of the proposed current control method. experimental verification is currently under investigation.
microcontroller	this study presents an animal mobility system, equipped with a positioning running wheel (prw), as a way to quantify the efficacy of an exercise activity for reducing the severity of the effects of the stroke in rats. this system provides more effective animal exercise training than commercially available systems such as treadmills and motorized running wheels (mrws). in contrast to an mrw that can only achieve speeds below 20 m/min, rats are permitted to run at a stable speed of 30 m/min on a more spacious and high-density rubber running track supported by a 15 cm wide acrylic wheel with a diameter of 55 cm in this work. using a predefined adaptive acceleration curve, the system not only reduces the operator error but also trains the rats to run persistently until a specified intensity is reached. as a way to evaluate the exercise effectiveness, real-time position of a rat is detected by four pairs of infrared sensors deployed on the running wheel. once an adaptive acceleration curve is initiated using a microcontroller, the data obtained by the infrared sensors are automatically recorded and analyzed in a computer. for comparison purposes, 3 week training is conducted on rats using a treadmill, an mrw and a prw. after surgically inducing middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao), modified neurological severity scores (mnss) and an inclined plane test were conducted to assess the neurological damages to the rats. prw is experimentally validated as the most effective among such animal mobility systems. furthermore, an exercise effectiveness measure, based on rat position analysis, showed that there is a high negative correlation between the effective exercise and the infarct volume, and can be employed to quantify a rat training in any type of brain damage reduction experiments.
electrical_network	this paper presents a load control method for small data centers, which are rarely studied although they account for more than 50% of all data centers. the method utilizes the data network and the electrical network to control power usage for participation in demand response (dr) programs, which are regarded as the killer applications of the emerging smart grid (sg). traditional data center power management often directly manipulates energy usage, which may be ineffective or impractical for small data centers due to their limited resources. both the sg and the data centers are considered to be the cyber-physical systems (cpss). this article proposes an approach that performs the data center dr load management through the cyberspaces of the sg and the targeted data center. the proposed method instructs the workload dispatcher to select the best-suited algorithm when a dr event is issued. additionally, this method also adjusts the temperature set-points of the air conditioners. the simulation result shows that this approach can achieve a 30% power reduction for dr.

analog_signal_processing	analog multipliers are one of the most important building blocks in analog signal processing circuits. the performance with high linearity and wide input range is usually required for analog four-quadrant multipliers in most applications. therefore, a highly linear and wide input range four-quadrant cmos analog multiplier using active feedback is proposed in this paper. firstly, a novel configuration of four-quadrant multiplier cell is presented. its input dynamic range and linearity are improved significantly by adding two resistors compared with the conventional structure. then based on the proposed multiplier cell configuration, a four-quadrant cmos analog multiplier with active feedback technique is implemented by two operational amplifiers. because of both the proposed multiplier cell and active feedback technique, the proposed multiplier achieves a much wider input range with higher linearity than conventional structures. the proposed multiplier was fabricated by a 0.6 mu m cmos process. experimental results show that the input range of the proposed multiplier can be up to 5.6v(pp) with 0.159% linearity error on vx and 4.8v(pp) with 0.51% linearity error on vy for +/- 2.5v power supply voltages, respectively.

electrical_circuits	the programme of discretization of famous completely integrable systems and associated linear operators was launched in the 1990s. in particular, the properties of second-order difference operators on triangulated manifolds and equilateral triangular lattices have been studied by novikov and dynnikov since 1996. this study included laplace transformations, new discretizations of complex analysis, and new discretizations of gl(n)-connections on triangulated n-dimensional manifolds. a general theory of discrete gl(n)-connections 'of rank one' has been developed (see the introduction for definitions). the problem of distinguishing the subclass of sln-connections (and unimodular sln +/--connections, which satisfy det a - +/- 1) has not been solved. in the present paper it is shown that these connections play an important role (which is similar to the role of magnetic fields in the continuous case) in the theory of self-adjoint schrodinger difference operators on equilateral triangular lattices in r-2. in appendix 1 a complete characterization is given of unimodular sln +/--connections of rank 1 for all n >1, thus correcting a mistake (it was wrongly claimed that they reduce to a canonical connection for n >2). with the help of a communication from korepanov, a complete clarification is provided of how the classical theory of electrical circuits and star-triangle transformations is connected with the discrete laplace transformations on triangular lattices.(1)
microcontroller	nowadays with the increasing amount of waste generated and limited landfill space for waste disposal, recycling is one of the important approaches to manage the waste effectively. the current manual recycling practice in which the user need to bring the waste in bulk to the recycling center might be hassle and hence become a discouraging factor for them to recycle. to overcome such an issue, in this project an automated recycle bin with a reward feature is proposed that derived from a reverse vending machine (rvm) concept. basically, the system is implemented in a standard recycle bin provided by local municipal that equipped with microcontroller and collection of sensors. throughout the process, the sensors responsible to identifying user information, weight the scale and eventually convert the weight to the corresponding points automatically. once the process completed, the user can claim their points by using rfid point card. all the mentioned process will be controlled by a microcontroller. the system has been implemented in a small scale user testing and the framework shows its effectiveness for handling the whole process. the prototype is expected to aid in accelerating the motivation among malaysian to recycle their waste, and can be one of the frameworks to overcome urban poverty issue by using waste to wealth concept.

operational_amplifier	an auto-zero and chopper operational amplifier with a 4.5-60 v supply voltage range is realized, using a 0.18 mu m cmos process augmented by 5 v cmos and 60 v dmos transistors. it achieves a maximum offset voltage drift of 0.02 mu v/degrees c, a minimum cmrr of 145 db, a noise psd of 6.8 nv/root hz, and a 3.1 mhz unity gain bandwidth, while dissipating 840 mu a of current. up-modulated chopper ripple is suppressed by auto-zeroing. furthermore, glitches from the charge injection of the input switches are mitigated by employing six parallel input stages with 800 khz interleaved clocks. this moves the majority of the glitch energy up to 4.8 mhz, while leaving little energy at 800 khz. as a result, the requirements on an external low-pass glitch filter is relaxed, and a wider usable signal bandwidth can be obtained. maximum input bias current due to charge injection mismatch is reduced from 1.5 na to 150 pa by post production trimming with an on-chip charge mismatch compensation circuit.
signal-flow_graph	the methods for switched-capacitor (sc) noise analysis published up to this date fall in two groups: one group contains methods suitable for analysis by hand that are not easily applicable to all sc circuits. the other group contains methods that are applicable to all sc circuits, but require matrix manipulations with a computer algebra tool. in this paper, we show a universally applicable hand-analysis method. the main reason why sc noise analysis is so difficult is that noise is sampled on many different capacitors, and when being sampled, its spectrum is aliased. the core idea of making analysis by hand possible is to use an intuitive rather than an algebraic method to derive the continuous-time noise spectra in the different phases. our method combines charge-equation analysis for the discrete-time aspects with signal-flow-graph analysis for the continuous-time aspects of a circuit. we show in tutorial style how to apply it, and demonstrate that it is very useful for getting insight into sc circuits, deriving simplified expressions, and getting a good correspondence with behavioural simulations using spectrerf.
microcontroller	this paper presents a portable radar system for short-range localization, inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging, and vital sign tracking. the proposed sensor incorporates frequency-modulated continuous-wave (fmcw) and interferometry (doppler) modes, which enable this radar system to obtain both absolute range information and tiny vital signs (i.e., respiration and heartbeat) of human targets. these two different operation modes can be switched through an on-board microcontroller. to simplify the system, the proposed radar utilizes the audio card of a laptop to sample the baseband signal. the fmcw mode of the radar uses operational-amplifierbased circuits to generate an analog sawtooth signal and a reference pulse sequence (rps). the rps is locked to the sawtooth signal to obtain coherence for the radar system. for the interferometry mode, a low-intermediate-frequency modulation method is implemented to avoid the slow vital signs from being distorted by the high-pass filter of the audio card. several experiments were carried out to reveal the capability and distinct operational features of the proposed portable hybrid radar. the experiments also showed that the system can easily detect glass, which is usually difficult to identify for optical-based sensors. in addition, 2-d scanning in a complex environment revealed that the proposed radar was able to differentiate human targets from other objects. moreover, isar images were used to isolate moving human targets from surrounding clutter. finally, the proposed radar also demonstrated its ability to accurately measure vital signs when a human subject sits still.
system_identification	monitoring and analyzing floor vibrations to determine human activity has major applications in fields such as health care and security. for example, structural vibrations could be used to determine if an elderly person living independently falls, or if a room is occupied or empty. monitoring human activity using floor vibration promises to have advantages over other methods. for example, it does not have the privacy concerns of other methods such as vision-based techniques, or the compliance challenges of wearable sensors. the analysis of the signals becomes a classification problem determining the type of human activity. unfortunately only a few research groups are performing research of this subject even though there is a significant number of techniques that could be applied to this field. to date, no systematic study about the challenges and advantages of using different types of algorithms for this problem has been performed. this paper proposes a benchmark problem to: (i) encourage researchers to design new algorithms for monitoring human activity using floor vibrations, (ii) provide a dataset to test new algorithms, and (iii) allow the comparison of proposed methods based on a set of standard metrics. the benchmark consists of seven different cases of increasing difficulty. each case has a specific number of sensors, calibration signals, and type of floor excitation forces to be considered. the paper also proposes specific metrics that enable the direct comparison of different techniques. research groups interested in monitoring human activity using floor vibrations are encouraged to use the experimental data and evaluation metrics published in this paper to develop their own methodologies. this will enable the community of researchers to easily compare and contrasts techniques and better understand what type of methods will be appropriate in different applications.

state_space_representation	in the frame structure of stacker cranes during non-stationary phases of movement due to inertial forces undesirable mast vibrations may occur. this effect can reduce the stability and positioning accuracy of these machines. the aim of this paper is to introduce an accurate and quite simple dynamical model of single-mast stacker cranes, which is suitable for investigating the mast vibrations of these machines. the multi-body modelling approach is selected to generate the differential equations of motion for this model. the solution of these equations is performed by means of the so-called modal coordinate transformation or modal superposition method. in this model structural damping is taken into consideration by means of the so-called proportional damping (rayleigh damping) approach. the main advantage of the presented multi-body model is that with this model the mast-vibrations can be investigated in various positions of the mast. dynamic models with varying lifted load positions can also be generated in simple way by using the introduced modelling technique. the main properties, i.e., the state space representation of our model as well as time domain simulation results, are also introduced.

electricity	a new microbent in-line microfiber interferometer (mi-mi) is proposed and demonstrated as a compact temperature and current sensor. the mi-mi is capable of generating interference fringes with a high extinction ratio of about 12.0 db and a free spectral range of 1.9 nm at a wavelength of 1545 nm. when employed as a temperature sensor, a copper wire carrying a direct current is placed against the mi-mi sensor, and the interference fringes of the mi-mi sensor shifts toward the longer wavelength as the heat generated by the copper wire increases. as the temperature increase corresponds linearly to the current, thus the measurement of the current can be extrapolated as well. the sensor has a temperature responsivity of 33.0 pm/degrees c with a linearity of more than 0.97 as well as a current responsitivity of 1.46 degrees c/a(2), and has significant potential for application as a health and warning sensor for electricity generation and distribution grids.
operational_amplifier	the effective transconductance (g(m)) of a bulk-driven operational amplifier opamp) can significantly vary with the input common-mode voltage. this variation of g(m) complicates frequency compensation and creates harmonic distortion. thus, this brief presents a g(m)-stabilizing technique to reduce the variation of g(m) across the input common-mode range (icmr). the idea is to use a variable positive feedback structure to adaptively control g(m) to the input common-mode voltage. a low-voltage bulk-driven opamp with the proposed g(m)-stabilizing technique has been implemented in a 0.18-mu m n-well cmos process. the opamp consumes 261 mu w from a 900-mv supply voltage. the variation of g(m) is reduced from 132% to 25% across the rail-to-rail icmr. the measured dc gain is 76.8 db and the unity-gain bandwidth is 7.11 mhz when the opamp is loaded with 17 pf parallel to 1 m omega.

electrical_network	high penetration of wind energy into the network may introduce stability and power quality problems due to the fluctuating nature of the wind and the increasing complexity of the power system. this paper describes a novel approach to voltage and power control of a radial electrical distribution network, using a wind farm. the wind farm consists of seven 75 kw induction generators (dfig) supplying two ac/dc converters. the feed structure of the dfig allows operating the system conversion in a wide range of speed variations. that is why it is a recommended solution, due to its capacity to increase the generator power to twice its nominal power; consequently, the system 's size and cost are reduced. another advantage is that the system is decoupled with an electrical network, so the disturbances do not affect the dfig and this also avoids the problems of coupling the machine to the power grid. through a 14-node distribution network, this study proves that the method is feasible. a simulation work was carried out with the software matlab/simulink. the results obtained prove that this control is suitable for regulating the desired power flows in a power network and providing the best voltage profile in the system, as well as minimizing the system transmission losses when inserting the wind farm into the electrical network.

system_identification	the well-known reweighted zero-attracting least mean square algorithm (rza-lms) has been effective for the estimation of sparse system channels. however, the rza-lms algorithm utilizes a fixed step size to balance the steady-state mean square error and the convergence speed, resulting in a reduction in its performance. thus, a trade-off between the convergence rate and the steady-state mean square error must be made. in this paper, utilizing the nonlinear relationship between the step size and the power of the noise-free prior error, a variable step-size strategy based on an error function is proposed. the simulation results indicate that the proposed variable step-size algorithm shows a better performance than the conventional rza-lms for both the sparse and the non-sparse systems.
electric_motor	improvement of quality and value addition of agricultural produces has gained higher concern in recent times in sri lanka due to creation of new opportunities for sale of agricultural commodities in open market at competitive prices. grading according to the sizes is an important value adding technique for most agricultural products. and also the price of the many agricultural products varies significantly according to their uniformity in size. uniformity in size not only makes the produce more attractive to consumers but also improve its processing qualities. at present, size grading of most agricultural crops including big onion are carried out manually by crop collectors, whole sellers and retail sellers, most of farmers market their products without any grading. in sri lanka, persons engaging in post-harvest crop handling such as collectors, whole sellers, retail sellers, and farmers have less chance to use high technical and costly grading technique. and also local market survey reported, retail market price of the big onion bulbs are significantly varied according to its size. hence, this research study attempted to design and development of a low cost size grading machine for size grading of big onion bulbs. size grading machine was fabricated by cast iron and pvc tube and it was designed for grading of onion bulbs into three sizes i.e. small (phi<4 cm), medium (4 < phi6cm). grading machine was also fabricated to operate either by manual or electric motor. the machine was tested for grading efficiency/quality accordingly, machine performance was optimized. optimized machine adjustments for its maximum performance were 3 degrees inclined angle of the grading cylinder against horizontal axis and 15 rpm rotating speed of the grading cylinder. maximum grading qualities/efficiencies under optimized machine adjustments for small, medium and large sizes were reported 84.47%, 93.46% and 90.14 respectively. the capacity of the grading machine was 630 kg/hour under the optimized operational conditions.

electric_motor	this paper deals with the losses caused by the welding to fix laminated cores of a traction motor. although a number of studies have been performed on the motor design to increase the motor efficiency, there are few technical studies to implement the effect of manufacturing process, such as welding, on the motor design. however, the losses may have a significant effect on the motor performances. thus, in this paper, welding loss models considering flux densities, frequencies, stack length and the number of welding passes are proposed from the data measured directly by welded ring cores. finally, the effect of these welding loss models are verified through a comparison with measured motor losses.
system_identification	thermoacoustic instabilities in gas turbines and aeroengine combustors fall within the category of complex systems. they can be described phenomenologically using nonlinear stochastic differential equations, which constitute the grounds for output-only model-based system identification. it has been shown recently that one can extract the governing parameters of the instabilities, namely the linear growth rate and the nonlinear component of the thermoacoustic feedback, using dynamic pressure time series only. this is highly relevant for practical systems, which cannot be actively controlled due to a lack of cost-effective actuators. the thermoacoustic stability is given by the linear growth rate, which results from the combination of the acoustic damping and the coherent feedback from the flame. in this paper, it is shown that it is possible to quantify the acoustic damping of the system, and thus to separate its contribution to the linear growth rate from the one of the flame. this is achieved by postprocessing in a simple way simultaneously acquired chemiluminescence and acoustic pressure data. it provides an additional approach to further unravel from observed time series the key mechanisms governing the system dynamics. this straightforward method is illustrated here using experimental data from a combustion chamber operated at several linearly stable and unstable operating conditions.
digital_control	this work presents a control system suitable for high-precision pulsed current sources. the proposed control system is based on the detection of events so as to define changes in the power converter state to produce the required current waveform with a good dynamic response. additionally, this control system is designed to regulate the flat-top current with a well-defined precision. in order to mitigate the effect of the measurement noise, an estimation algorithm for the controlled current is incorporated. this algorithm generates a filtered version of the controlled variable without affecting the control dynamics. the use of the estimated current allows to improve the detection of the events and to avoid an increase in the number of commutations due to possible erratic comparisons. then, the estimator gains are tuned by using genetic algorithm techniques to optimize the root-mean-square value for a typical pulse. furthermore, in order to independently perform the required set of tasks, the proposed control system is implemented by using a digital platform based on a field-programmable gate array. additionally, due to the demanding precision in these applications, different considerations regarding its implementation, such as the digital wordlength, binary point position, rounding method, and overflow behavior, have been taken into account. experimental results obtained from the application of the proposed control system to a laboratory prototype are presented.
system_identification	rule-based classification systems constructed upon linguistic terms in the antecedent and consequent of the rules lack sufficient generalization capabilities. this paper proposes a new multivariate fuzzy system identification algorithm to design binary rule-based classification structures through making use of the repulsive forces between the cluster prototypes of different class labels. this approach is coupled with the potential discrimination power of each dimension in the feature space to increase the generalization potential. to address this issue, first the multivariate variant of a newly proposed soft clustering algorithm along with its mathematical foundations is proposed. next, the discriminatory power of each individual feature is computed, using the multivariate membership values in the proposed clustering algorithm to achieve the most accurate firing degree in each rule. the main advantage of this method is to handle unbalanced datasets yielding superior true positive measure while keeping the false positive rate low enough to avoid the natural bias toward class labels containing larger number of training samples. to validate the proposed approaches, a series of numerical experiments on publicly available datasets and a real clinical dataset collected by our team were conducted. simulation results demonstrated achievement of the primary goals of this research.

electricity	apples are a widely consumed fruit and have a high polyphenol content. the aim of this study was to analyse the combined effects of osmotic dehydration (od) and ohmic heating (oh) with a pulsed vacuum (pv) on polyphenol retention during the stored refrigeration of apple cubes. treatments were performed using a 65 degrees brix sucrose solution at 30, 40 or 50 degrees c for 120 min, and then, samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees c. oh provides an electric field of 13 v cm(-1), and a pulsed vacuum was applied for 5 min at the beginning of the process. the results indicated that a lower temperature process (30-40 degrees c) resulted in the retention of more polyphenol compounds after treatment than a higher temperature process (50 degrees c). nevertheless, during refrigerated storage, we observed that 50 degrees c preserved these compounds better due to polyphenol oxidase inactivation. pvod/oh treatment at 50 degrees c was determined to be the best retention of polyphenols from the fresh apple for dehydrating apples.

analog_signal_processing	electrocardiogram (ecg) detection in patients with heart health is an important technical means. because the load of heart is added in motion, heart diseases are likely to be induced by signal. the detection of ecg in the moving state is more necessary. but the ecg signal, a weak bioelectrical signal, is susceptible to environmental interference. especially in the state of motion, the ecg includes the main interference signals: motion jitter interference, frequency interference, baseline drift and capacitively coupled noise between the electrode line interference. this paper studies the noise signals. 50hz band-stop filter, the right leg driven circuit and 0.1-150hz band pass filter are used in the analog signal processing, and the wavelet transform algorithm is used in digital signal processing. ecg can be detected in a strong movement noise background. the results show that the sensor has the advantages of anti-interference, high fidelity, fast response speed and good stability.
electrical_network	the paper describes the development of a hardware-in-the-loop (hil) test platform for the performance assessment of a pmu-based sub-second linear real-time state estimator (rtse) for active distribution networks (adns). the estimator relies on the availability of data coming from phasor measurement units (pmus) and can be applied to both balanced and unbalanced adns. the paper first illustrates the architecture of the experimental hil setup that has been fully designed by the authors. it consists of a real-time simulator (rts) that models the electrical network model as well as the measurement infrastructure composed by virtual pmus. these virtual devices stream their data to a real phasor data concentrator (pdc) suitably coupled with a discrete kalman filter state estimator (dkf-se). by using this experimental setup, the paper discusses the performance assessment of the whole process in terms of estimation accuracy and time latencies. in the rts, a real adn located in the netherlands has been modeled together with the associated pmus.
electricity	the research ""behavior change and energy use"" (us department of energy and climate change, 2011) [1] shows that with better information in the monthly electricity bill, the energy performance certificate (epc) can encourage people to reduce their energy usage. that is why smart meters - the emerging technology to help people to know their monthly energy consumption, are gradually replacing mechanical power meters. in this paper, we investigate a special energy monitoring process named non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (nialm), which is potentially the best method to give consumers pertinent information with respect to power consumption. however, real-time feedback feature in a low cost nialm system is still a big challenge in such technology because of the complication in nialm 's algorithms. system on chip (soc) technology can solve this challenge. besides including high-speed interconnection and multi-processors, integrating field-programmable gate array (fpga) into socs may be the most important evolution, which provides developers a powerful tool to develop a low cost but high performance system. therefore, in this paper we proposed a development of a real-time nialm system based on the soc with fpga acceleration.

digital_control	this paper introduces a high power density step-up converter for led applications, based on a hybrid serial-output (hso) architecture [1], which is suitable for on-chip implementation. in this system, the output voltage is formed by stacking the output of a switched-capacitor (sc) converter on top of a boost converter output. the high power density sc converter processes around a half of the power of the system and is left unregulated. the boost converter processes the remainder of the power and regulates the output voltage. in comparison with conventional boost-based solutions, the introduced boost-sc hso drastically reduces the passive component volume and decreases peak voltage stress of switches. experimental results obtained with a 3.7 v to 13 v, 2.6 w, 1080 khz prototype show that the introduced sc-boost hso converter has about three times smaller reactive component area than a conventional boost having the same power processing efficiency.

electric_motor	the paper deals with the motion control of an induction motor. because the nonlinear state equations describing the dynamics of such a machine can be embedded into a linear model with the rotor speed as a varying parameter, advantage is taken of some recent results on the control of linear parameter-varying systems, thus ensuring stability independently of how the varying parameter changes in time within a compact set. the adopted control structure consists of a fast inner electric loop that controls the stator currents and an outer mechanical loop that generates the torque acting on the motor shaft. of crucial importance is the design of the internal model controller for the current loop. in particular, it is proved that an algebraically equivalent electric motor model admits a lyapunov function that, together with its lyapunov derivative, is independent of and of all motor parameters. this result allows us to find an upper bound on the norm of the youla-kucera parameter that ensures robust stability against speed measurement errors. simulations carried out on a benchmark motor model show that the adopted control strategy performs well. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
electrical_network	power systems are getting complicated as load centers get connected through network thus forming power grids. since then black outs of power systems have become common. in an interconnected system, the loss of generation in one area can be replaced by generation from other areas. thus, several systems interconnected can survive contingencies that the individual systems could not. thus one benefit of interconnected power systems is the potential for increased reliability. this paper discusses the implementation of an automatic load transfer program in a ring electrical network using supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) system that automates electric power system operations thus maintaining reliability.
electric_motor	aluminum can be absorbed through the digestive system from water and drinks and the food that contains natural traces and processed food or the food cooked in aluminum cookware. some studies show that the people exposed to high levels of aluminum may develop kidney, bone and brain diseases. aluminum foil (alfesi) is daily used as packaging for food and drugs stored in the refrigerator where an electric motor induces a magnetic field of a few microteslas. the purpose of this work is to study the corrosion behavior of various aluminum packaging foils and the effect of a weak magnetic field on the morphology and the corrosion kinetics in the 0.3 % and 3 % of mass fractions of nacl solutions. the mean results for various aluminum packaging foils show that localized corrosion is controlled by the electrochemical potentials of different phases constituting the aluminum foil and the concentration of the precipitates from the other phases. the morphology and the corrosion kinetics of aluminum packaging foil in the 0.3 % and 3 % of mass fractions of nacl solutions are different with and without an application of a weak magnetic field. electrochemical tests applied to cheese packaging paper show that the introduction of a magnetic field decreases the polarization resistance, the potential of passivation and the value of the open-circuit potential at the beginning of the corrosion; however, its passivation-current density increases at the beginning of the corrosion. the values of the open-circuit potential with and without a weak magnetic field are the same after thirty days of corrosion.

digital_control	digitally controlled oscillators are the main cores in all-digital phase-locked loops (adpll), which are important for determining the range of frequency and power consumption in adplls. in the conventional digitally controlled oscillator (dco) designs, one single band of operation is assigned to the dco. the following paper presents a new approach in the design of dcos, which works in dual-band and wide-band modes with a control unit. in dual-band mode, the dco works in two different ranges of frequencies simultaneously via digital control bits. the wide-band dco (wbdco) works in one wider range of frequencies consecutively. it seems that in the wide-band dco, the gap width for the dual-band dco (dbdco) is zero. the previously mentioned designs allow the designer to have standard frequencies with the help of direct or multiplied frequencies. so, we can have a trade-off between power and performance. this means that we can have low power consumption in low-frequency applications and vice versa. the proposed designs are based on using digitally controlled capacitors, current starving gates and schmitt triggers in critical points of the dco loop, while preserving coarse and fine tunings. the non-delay linearity factors are clearly investigated and resolved with the use of a new combined control unit. the simulations of the proposed designs are performed in hspice with a voltage of v in 180 nm cmos technology for 64- and 128-bit input coarse codes. our simulation and evaluation results showed that in the dual-band dco, a 14.8 ps jitter was calculated at 134 mhz with 1.2131 mw power consumption, while in the wide band with overlap mode, a 68.7 ps jitter was measured at 184.61 mhz with 1.604 mw power consumption. our designs are proper for reconfigurable and multi-standard adpll designs.

signal-flow_graph	we address the problem of testing digital shapers used for nuclear spectroscopy. particularly, we propose a solution based on the oscillation-based test (obt) for testing the finite impulse response (fir) filters of the shaper. the obt strategy developed here exploits the natural partition of the system in high-pass and low-pass sections for implementing two different non-linear oscillators. the oscillation parameters are obtained in advance using two different approaches: one based on the filter signal flow-graph; the other based oil the describing function technique. the fault simulation results show high fault coverage and acceptable test time. additionally, we suggest the use of this test strategy in a bist environment, because it does not need resources for pattern generation and presents both low system intrusion and low hardware overhead.
system_identification	this study reports on the assessment of the vibrational serviceability performance of a parallel cable-stayed bridge, which was subjected to a vortex-induced vibration (viv) in 2011, by identifying modal damping ratios from the operational monitoring data that were obtained. the natural excitation technique (next) combined with the eigen realization algorithm (era) was applied for the output-only modal analysis. parameters regarding the next and era procedures were determined from a sensitivity analysis of identified damping ratios. because a multiple tuned mass damper (mtmd) was installed at the center of the main span to mitigate viv, the modal damping ratios before and after the installation of the mtmd were also compared. several sets of operational monitoring data that had been collected under various windy conditions were used to develop a relationship between the identified damping ratios and the corresponding viv level of the bridge. on the basis of these findings, the performance of the bridge was enhanced regarding vibrational serviceability.

electrical_network	in this work, the problem of intracellular currents in longilinear bacteria, such as escherichia coli, suspended in a physiological medium and submitted to a harmonic voltage (ac), is analyzed using the finite-element-based software comsol multiphysics. bacterium was modeled as a cylindrical capsule, ended by semi-spheres and surrounded by a dielectric cell wall. an equivalent single-layer cell wall was defined, starting from the well-recognized three-shell modeling approach. the bacterium was considered immersed in a physiological medium, which was also taken into account in the modeling. a new complex transconductance was thus introduced, relating the complex ratio between current inside the bacterium and voltage applied between two parallel equipotential planes, separated by a realistic distance. when voltage was applied longitudinally relative to the bacterium main axis, numerical results in terms of frequency response in the 1-20 mhz range for e. coli cells revealed that transconductance magnitude exhibited a maximum at a frequency depending on the cell wall capacitance. this occurred in spite of the purely passive character of the model and could be explained by an equivalent electrical network giving very similar results and showing special conditions for lateral paths of the currents through the cell wall. it is shown that the main contribution to this behavior is due to the conductive part of the current.

analog_signal_processing	the recent developments of electron quantum optics in quantum hall edge channels have given us new ways to probe the behavior of electrons in quantum conductors. it has brought new quantities called electronic coherences under the spotlight. in this paper, we explore the relations between electron quantum optics and signal processing through a global review of the various methods for accessing single- and two-electron coherences in electron quantum optics. we interpret electron quantum optics interference experiments as analog signal processing, converting quantum signals into experimentally observable quantities such as current averages and correlations. this point of view also gives us a procedure to obtain quantum information quantities from electron quantum optics coherences. we illustrate these ideas by discussing two-mode entanglement in electron quantum optics. we also sketch how signal processing ideas may open new perspectives for representing electronic coherences in quantum conductors and understand the properties of the underlying many-body electronic state.
digital_control	there has been a growing demand of using multi-function inverters for grid-connected systems applied to nonconventional energy sources, such as solar, wind and so on. in addition to power quality conditioning, the inverter can also be used for bidirectional active power exchange with a three-phase four-wire grid. therefore, the inverter acts as a multi-function compensator. the functions of the proposed inverter system include active power injection, rectification and active power filtering (apf) (including phase power balancing). this paper presents design and implementation of a three-leg split-capacitor shunt multi-function inverter with division-summation (d-sigma) digital control. the adopted d-sigma digital control can accommodate filter inductance variation, reducing core size significantly, and its control laws can be derived directly to cancel the variation effects of dc-bus voltage, switching period and filter inductance. an average power method is adopted in this paper for determining fundamental currents at the source side. in the design and implementation, the inductances corresponding to various inductor currents were estimated at the startup and stored in the microcontroller for scheduling loop gain cycle by cycle, which can insure system stability. measured results from a three-phase four-wire inverter have confirmed the analysis and discussion.
electricity	resources scarcity and electricity demand have been dramatically increasing. wastewater is recognized as one of resources for water, energy and plant fertilizing nutrients. nevertheless, current wastewater treatment technologies have limitations due principally to their energy- and cost-intensive for achieving the conversion target of wastewater recovery. it is desired to develop a new technology to generate alternatives to conventional energy sources in a sustainable manner. an innovative technology based on the use of microbial fuel cells (mfcs) has been proved as a critical pathway for bioconversion processes towards electricity generation, then for addressing energy and environmental problems. three special features including energy saving, less sludge production and less energy production make mfcs outstanding compared with the existing technologies. multiform wastewaters could be efficiently degraded through advancing mfcs alone or integrating mfcs with other processing units. however, the low power density and the high operating cost of mfcs have greatly limited their applications on large-scale problems, and then result in some debates and doubts about their development and applications. therefore, this paper objectively discussed the problems and applications of mfcs in wastewater treatment. moreover, the integration of mfcs with other treatment processes was presented to verify the practicality and effectiveness of mfcs in contaminants removal. furthermore, the primary challenges and opportunities for scaling-up and future applications of mfcs in wastewater were analyzed.

state_space_representation	the problem of controlling doubly fed induction generators (dfig) associated with wind turbines is addressed. the control objective is twofold: maximum power point tracking and reactive power regulation in the dfig. unlike previous works, we seek the achievement of this control objective without resorting to physical sensors of mechanical variables (e.g., wind turbine velocity and dfig rotor speed). interestingly, wind velocity is also not assumed to be accessible to measurements. the control problem is dealt with using an output feedback controller designed on the basis of the nonlinear state-space representation of the controlled system. the controller is constituted of a high-gain nonlinear state observer and a nonlinear sliding state feedback mode. using tools from lyapunov 's stability, it is formally shown that the closed-loop control system, expressed in terms of the state estimation errors and the output-reference tracking errors, enjoys a semi-global practical stability. accordingly, it is possible to tune the controller design parameters so that it meets its objectives with an arbitrarily high accuracy, whatever the initial conditions are. these theoretical results are confirmed by simulations involving wide range variation of the wind speed.
electric_motor	assisting the control of a vehicle 's speed while driving downhill improves the vehicle 's safety and reduces the driver 's workload in both internal-combustion engine vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. the current technology widely used in internal-combustion engine vehicles is a hill descent control system. however, hill descent control can be achieved only at lower speeds, but it may also lead to thermal wear of the brake components during prolonged intensive braking. there is currently no effective downhill safety assistance control technology for hybrid electric vehicles that is effective across the full range of speeds and can take advantage of regenerative braking. to address the limitations of previous studies, a novel downhill safety assistant control strategy for hybrid electric vehicles, which adapts to the characteristics of different drivers and takes advantage of all braking subsystems of hybrid electric vehicles, is proposed in this paper to improve the vehicle safety, the fuel economy and the ride comfort for the full range of speeds. to adapt to the characteristics of different drivers, the downhill driver 's intention model is established on the basis of a statistical data analysis of questionnaires and experiments, which is used to determine the control mode 's switching conditions and the control objective for downhill safety assistant control. to improve the vehicle safety, the fuel economy and the ride comfort for the full speed range, a coordinated control strategy for the electric motor 's braking subsystem, the engine 's braking subsystem and the hydraulic braking subsystem is developed, which includes six braking assistant modes, an identifying strategy and torque control of the electric motor based on coordinated control strategies. simulations and experimental results show that the proposed control strategy improves the vehicle safety, the fuel economy and the ride comfort of hybrid electric vehicles during downhill driving.
microcontroller	power-on reset (por), power supply monitor (psm) and control of dc-dc converters are required circuits in embedded systems. mobile systems often need special power down modes where these three functions por, psm and dc-dc control must be executed taking less than 1 mu a of current in total. traditional design techniques meet a fatal area problem as they try to reduce current by increasing the area of the design. this paper presents a power management (pmg) system designed in a 1.2v/90nm cmos process. the system is part of a cortex m3-based microcontroller. the pmg offers the por, psm and dcdc converter control functions for a 1.2v regulated supply and por, psm for the battery. this paper presents the best published combination of high precision (< 1.2% variation of trip voltages), power consumption (250nw), area (0.044mm(2)), and number of trip points observed (18).
system_identification	the well-known variable step-size least-mean-square (vsslms) algorithm provides faster convergence rate while maintaining lower mean-square error than the conventional lms algorithm. the performance of the vsslms algorithm can be improved further in a channel estimation problem if the impulse response of the channel is sparse. recently, a zero-attracting (za)-vsslms algorithm was proposed to exploit the sparsity of a channel. this was done by imposing an l(1) -norm penalty to the original cost function of the vsslms algorithm which utilizes the sparsity in the filter taps during the adaptation process. in this paper, we present the mean-square deviation (msd) analysis of the za-vsslms algorithm. a steady-state msd expression for the za-vsslms algorithm is derived. an upper bound of the zero-attractor controller (p) that provides the minimum msd is also provided. moreover, the effect of the noise distribution on the msd performance is shown theoretically. it is shown that the theoretical and simulation results of the algorithm are in good agreement with a wide range of parameters, different channel, input signal, and noise types.
electrical_circuits	burgers-huxley equations and their reduced form are of vital importance in modeling the interaction between reaction mechanisms, convection effects and diffusion transports. in this paper, we applied the reduced form of differential transform method (reduced-dtm), present in previous works (abazari and borhanifar, comput math appl 59:2711-2722, 2010; borhanifar and abazari, j appl math comput 35:37-51, 2011; borhanifar and abazari, opt commun 283:2026-2031, 2010; abazari and ganji, int j comput math 88(8):1749-1762, 2011; abazari and abazari, commun nonlinear sci numer simul 17:619629, 2012), to solving burgers-huxley equations and their three reduced equations, namely, the burgers equation, the huxley equation and the burgers-fisher equation. the results obtained employing rdtm are compared with previous semi-analytical methods, such as hpm (he, appl math comput 135:73-79, 2003), ham (liao, beyond perturbation: introduction to the homotopy analysis method. chapman & hall/crc press, boca raton, 2003), dtm (zhou, differential transformation and its application for electrical circuits. huazhong university press, wuhan, 1986) and exact solution. as an important result, it is depicted that the rdtm results are more accurate in comparison with those obtained by classic hpm, ham and dtm. the numerical results reveal that the rdtm is very effective, convenient and quite accurate to time dependance kind of nonlinear equations. it is predicted that the rdtm can be found widely applicable in engineering.

operational_amplifier	in this paper, using lab view graphical programming environment are made a number of virtual instruments which are used at the demo/study of low power active filters with operational amplifiers (op-amp). there are analyzed the active first order low pass, high pass and band pass filters. the results are included in two papers. the first one contains the simulation of active filters. the different values of passive components (feedback or input resistor and capacitors) around the op-amp can be selected with numerical controls for each type of filter. the effect is seen using the bode characteristic (frequency response curve for filter). the ac (alternating current) frequency characteristic is best described in term of a bode plot where the gain is plotted on a log scale on the vertical axis and the frequency is plotted on a log scale on the horizontal axis. the op-amp ideal frequency response curve (open loop) it is also displayed in the chart. the values of open loop gain and frequency cut-off are also set with numerical control. the validity of the program is done by comparing simulation results with data obtained by calculation using the theory. the program is designed in a modular manner and it can be used successfully in education and training courses.
analog_signal_processing	jitter limitations pose significant challenges for high-resolution and sampling-rate analog-to-digital converters (adcs). this paper describes an integrate-and-sample (ias) receiver suitable for use in an optical parametric photonic adc. rate-scalable photonic-sampling techniques provide low-jitter optical sampling and analog-to-digital conversion of the wideband signal up to 10 ghz and beyond. an 8-bit 2-gs/s ias receive channel is described for a rate-scalable photonic adc. electronic measurements are shown for an rf tone and a photonic gaussian pulse source and compared to simulations. a two-channel ias array is fabricated in a 120-nm sige bicmos process and packaged onto a printed circuit board for integration into the photonic-sampling setup. a single 2-gs/s channel achieves a measured performance higher than 8.1 enob. the two-channel integrated circuit consumes 890 ma per channel from 5- and 2.5-v supplies and occupies an area of 1.6 x 2.0 mm(2).
electricity	demand response, defined as the shifting of electricity demand, is generally believed to have value both for the grid and for the market: by matching demand more closely to supply, consumers could profit from lower prices, while in a smart grid environment, more renewable electricity can be used and less grid capacity may be needed. however, the introduction of residential demand response programmes to support the development of smart grids that includes renewable generation is hampered by a number of barriers. this paper reviews these barriers and categorises them for different demand programmes and market players. the case study for the netherlands shows that barriers can be country specific. two types of demand response programmes have been identified as being the most promising options for households in smart grids: price-based demand response and direct load control, while they may not be beneficial for market players or distribution system operators.

electricity	large wind parks (wps) are an essential priority, mainly in non-residential districts. especially the offshore wps, in areas with valuable energy potential, without legislation prohibits and without causing disturbance to the nearby community, could release enormous land for other uses (culture, recreation areas, tourism, etc.). the aim of this paper is to present a methodology for the sustainable siting of an offshore wp based on legal limitations, with a particular respect of ecological and economic resources using as example the island of crete. it will also be considered the visual, acoustic and aesthetic disturbance of the coastal area residents and visitors and integrate them into the context. one of the essential issues that make the region unique is the undersea relief, which makes difficult the numerous and large-scale intervention, because some areas are strictly protected by the eu. three steps have been followed: (i) exception of unsuitable areas (geological restrictions, visual and acoustical disturb and safety and of course due to environmental conditions); (ii) evaluation of environmental impacts on birdlife, special protection areas and sites of community importance; (iii) assessment of wind potential and needs of electricity in the regional unit of chania, in the western crete.

operational_amplifier	this paper presents a column-level 14-bit two-stage analog-to-digital converter (adc) based on pseudo-differential operational amplifier, which is designed for the readout circuit of x-ray sensor array. this low-power hybrid adc employs an incremental sigma-delta adc and a cyclic adc, achieving a good trade-off between accuracy and conversion speed. the two stages share the same analog circuit to reduce area and power consumption. a test chip is fabricated in 0.18 mu m cmos technology. the hybrid adc in each column is performed in parallel with power consumption of 218.813 mu w. the simulation result reveals the effective number of bits (enob) is 13.775 bits.
analog_signal_processing	the predictions of the different magnetic core losses with acceptable accuracy are key parameters for temperature-rise calculations for any considered up-rate in large hydro electrical machines. it is common practice for hydro electrical designers to compute the core losses in different section of the machine function of the flux density given only at 60 hz by the manufacturer of the steel lamination which probably leads to inaccurate prediction of the magnetic core losses. in this paper, certain currently available core loss models are used to compute the electromagnetic core losses in large hydro electrical machine. the obtained results are discussed and compared with the available test data.
electricity	early integration of sustainability decisions and mineralogical attributes into the design of minerals processing units offers potential for reducing environmental impacts at mining and processing sites. the objective of this study is to demonstrate how the integration of sustainability indicators and mineralogical attributes could be achieved in developing an integrated modelling framework of a magnetic separator. a magnetic separator unit model based on existing literature was developed to include process stream mineralogical data and to output sustainability indicators. the overall sustainability of processing three ore types (low, medium and high grade iron ore) was evaluated using the developed model. novel measures for evaluating magnetic separation (grade recovery deviation index (grdi)) and energy efficiency (rotational energy transfer efficiency (rete)) that incorporate the use of ore characteristics were developed in this study. these measures were used to calculate the separation and energy efficiency sustainability indicator ratings. in total eleven magnetic separator sustainability indicators were identified. each indicator was assigned a weighting value out of 10 based on its importance. of the 11 sustainability indicators identified; safety, reliability, carbon dioxide (co2) emissions, water use, noise and job creation ratings did not vary with changing mineralogical attributes of the feed ore. grdi, rete, electricity cost, particle emissions and waste generation ratings were observed to be dependent on the ore characteristics and therefore their values varied with different feed ore grades. the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) and weighted sum method (wsm) methods were applied to the sustainability indicator ratings and weightings to evaluate an overall sustainability cardinal score of processing a particular ore feed. results of this study demonstrate the dependence of overall process sustainability indicators on feed ore mineralogical attributes. the results also provide an indication of the effect of ore variability (typical within a single deposit) on sustainability indicators.

digital_control	based on the orthogonal superposition theorem of three alternating magnetic components, a universal uniform magnetic spin vector is superimposed using tri-axial helmholtz coils, achieving successive digital control of the orientation, the rotational speed, and the magnetic flux density of the universal magnetic spin vector. for increasing the magnitude and orientation accuracy of the magnetic spin vector, this paper presents a mathematical model associated with the magnitude error and orientation error of the universal magnetic spin vector, along with a double error compensation method for the magnitude and orientation of the universal magnetic spin vector superimposed by three alternating magnetic components. the double error compensation method includes the current magnitude compensation by three different structural coefficients of tri-axial helmholtz coils and the current phase compensation by two relative phase differences under linear polarization. the results have shown that the double compensation method can increase the magnitude and orientation accuracy of the rotating magnetic vector effectively, which would achieve an accurate posture adjustment and steering control on the capsule robots in curving environment.
microcontroller	we created an easy-to-use device for operant licking experiments and another device that records environmental variables. both devices use the raspberry pi computer to obtain data from multiple input devices (e.g., radio frequency identification tag readers, touch and motion sensors, environmental sensors) and activate output devices (e.g., led lights, syringe pumps) as needed. data gathered from these devices are stored locally on the computer but can be automatically transferred to a remote server via a wireless network. we tested the operant device by training rats to obtain either sucrose or water under the control of a fixed ratio, a variable ratio, or a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule. the lick data demonstrated that the device has sufficient precision and time resolution to record the fast licking behavior of rats. data from the environment monitoring device also showed reliable measurements. by providing the source code and 3d design under an open source license, we believe these examples will stimulate innovation in behavioral studies.
system_identification	background: tracking the changes of neural dynamics based on neuronal spiking activities is a critical step to understand the neurobiological basis of learning from behaving animals. these dynamical neurobiological processes associated with learning are also time-varying, which makes the modeling problem challenging. new method: we developed a novel multiwavelet-based time-varying generalized laguerre-volterra (tvglv) modeling framework to study the time-varying neural dynamical systems using natural spike train data. by projecting the time-varying parameters in the tvglv model onto a finite sequence of multiwavelet basis functions, the time-varying identification problem is converted into a time invariant linear-in-the-parameters one. an effective forward orthogonal regression (for) algorithm aided by mutual information (mi) criterion is then applied for the selection of significant model regressors or terms and the refinement of model structure. a generalized linear model fit approach is finally employed for parameter estimation from spike train data. results: the proposed multiwavelet-based tvglv approach is used to identify both synthetic input-output spike trains and spontaneous retinal spike train recordings. the proposed method gives excellent the performance of tracking either sharply or slowly changing parameters with high sensitivity and accuracy regardless of the a priori knowledge of spike trains, which these results indicate that the proposed method is shown to deal well with spike train data. comparison with existing methods: the proposed multiwavelet-based tvglv approach was compared with several state-of-art parametric estimation methods like the steepest descent point process filter (sdppf) or chebyshev polynomial expansion method. the conventional sdppf algorithm, or sdppf with b-splines wavelet expansion method was shown to have the poor performance of tracking the time varying system changes with the synthetic spike train data due to the slow convergence of the adaptive filter methods. although the chebyshev polynomial basis function method gave the good parametric estimation results, it requires prior parameter estimation. it was shown that the proposed multiwavelet-based tvglv method can track the time-varying parameter changes rapidly and accurately. conclusions: the multiwavelet-based tvglv modeling framework developed in this paper can not only provide a computational modeling scheme for investigating such nonstationary properties, track more general forms of changes in time-varying neural dynamics, and but also may potentially be applied to investigate the spatial-temporal information underlying biomedical spiking signals.

state_space_representation	the widely used instantaneous unit hydrograph (iuh) based on the nash cascade reservoir model was obtained under a zero initial condition, or equivalently an empty reservoir assumption. in this study, a more general case with a non-zero initial condition is considered in the derivation of the classical nash model. a generalized nash model (gnm) has been deduced using the laplace transform and the principle of mathematical induction. for river flow routing, the gnm physically interprets the formation of downstream outflow, i.e. the summation of the recession flow of the initial channel storage and the response to upstream inflow. the gnm, written in a state-space representation, is able to update the state of the river system in time, and hence can be applied in real-time forecasting. two separate case studies have been used for illustration. it is indicated that the proposed updating procedure results in improved river flow forecasts when compared with the traditional iuh method.

electricity	cyclic stability is a key factor in the design of thermochemical heat storage systems. because carbon dioxide (co2) may react with heat storage materials and lead to a decrease in energy storage efficiency, the effect of co2 on ca(oh)(2)/cao and mg(oh)(2)/mgo systems is investigated in this study. the experimental results show that co2 reacts with cao in the water vapor that appears during the heat release process. therefore, in the design of ca(oh)(2)/cao systems, co2 should be cleared from the system. the results from mg(oh)(2)/mgo systems show that co2 only slightly reacts with mgo and mg(oh)(2) during heat storage and release processes. this study indicates that carbonic acid (h2co3) could easily react with cao/ca(oh)(2) to form caco3 during heat release processes. generally, the remaining co2 reduces the reversibility of ca(oh)(2)/cao systems but has only a slight influence on mg(oh)(2)/mgo systems. in addition, the experimental results show that carbonate shell does not exist in rehydration for both of the cao/mgo samples, but the influence of co2 on the entire process increases after each cycle.

operational_amplifier	an analog front-end (afe) for a multifunction environmental sensor is proposed. the afe is designed to be able to sense 1 mu v, 1 fc, and 1 pa level signals in a low-frequency band around dc, and consists of an instrumentation amplifier (ia), a charge amplifier (ca), and a continuous time delta-sigma (ct-delta sigma) adc. to reduce the low-frequency noise of operational amplifier (opamp) which is used for signal path, this paper proposes a weak-inversion biasing technique. the designed ia achieved 26 nvrms input-referred noise (irn) in the band of 0.1-10 hz with 0.22 mm(2) die area. the designed ca achieved 25 acrms irn in charge sensing mode and 19 farms irn in current sensing mode in the band of 0.01-1 hz, respectively, and occupies 0.12 mm(2) die area. the afe has been fabricated in a 0.18 mu m cmos process with 4.5 mm(2) die area. the current consumption at 2.56 khz output data rate (odr) is 2.5 ma, reducing to 2 mu a at 0.01 hz odr.
digital_control	in high-quality education, topics concerning the behavior and control of electrical machines and power electronics have to be taught not only theoretically but also in a practical manner. hard-and software tools are necessary to fulfil this obligation. nevertheless, commercial systems partially lack of functionality or full accessibility to implement custom solutions, which is obligatory in the research and education domain. therefore, a digital signal processing system is presented, that allows full modification of every used device, both in hardware and in software.
microcontroller	we report the design, implementation and testing of an instrument for rapid dry rubber content (drc) determination in rubber latex. it is composed of rectangular waveguide antennae, microwave generator, power detector, and microcontroller. according to the theory of microwave transmission, the power loss of microwaves passing through latex is related to the drc. this attenuation is determined by measuring the transmitted microwave intensity with a power detector. the appropriate frequency that gives the best correlation between drc and attenuation was found to be about 2.36 ghz. the microwave power measurement is processed by the microcontroller using the empirical calibration equation to estimate drc in rubber latex. the instrument was tested using new latex samples with various drc, sampled locally in songkhla province, thailand, and the drc estimates by the instrument were compared to the slow but accurate standard oven-drying results. the estimates had an 0.21 % mean error and r (2) = 0.9983, indicating good practical performance.
microcontroller	vortex flowmeter is installed in piping to measure the fluid flow rate. the piping is easily disturbed by strong transient impact in the application fields, such as other components impacting on the pipeline, manual knocking on the pipe, and opening and closing of valves. the strong transient impact will be picked up by the vortex flow sensor, which makes the vortex flowmeter output wrong measurement results. the current commonly used digital signal processing method can do nothing about it. to solve this problem, an experimental setup is built in our laboratory to study the impact interference, and a large number of vortex flow sensor output signals are collected. the characteristics of transient impacts outputted by the vortex sensor are analyzed so as to describe this type of signal quantitatively. the pattern of transient impact is that the signal amplitudes increase suddenly and then attenuate gradually. a segmented kalman filter based digital signal processing method is proposed according to this pattern. the data segment containing strong transient impact is found first; the transient impact power is reduced by filtering the data segment second; and through spectral analysis of the filtered signal, the maximum peak of the spectrum is extracted as the vortex flow signal finally. the algorithm is implemented in real time by a low-power microcontroller. both gas and water flow experiments have been conducted to verify the validity and reliability of the antistrong transient impact algorithm.
system_identification	in this paper, we present a novel model updating method for damage detection of multi-story shear buildings during severe earthquakes. the story stiffnesses are explicitly presented in an incremental manner; this enables a simple and robust algorithm for the purpose of identification of the story stiffnesses. the estimated modal data, including natural frequencies and mode shapes of lower modes, are used in the proposed algorithm; moreover, sensitivity analysis of natural circular frequencies is incorporated to reduce possible errors. the story stiffnesses are identified by an iterative algorithm, and the window shift technique is adopted to present change of the story stiffness due to damages in the buildings during earthquakes. numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method is of high accuracy, even when the recorded responses are polluted by a relatively high level of (white) noises. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
analog_signal_processing	non-linear semi active vibration control devices have experienced a significant development in recent years, due to their performance and advantages compared with the passive and active approaches. pulse switching techniques, which were developed in the field of piezoelectric damping, lead to effective trade-offs between performance, simplicity and the required power supply. the control law in this method is based on triggering an inverting switch on each extremum of the produced voltage (or displacement); however, in the case of random excitation, false switching on the local maxima can reduce the efficiency overwhelmingly. a successful approach, to overcome this limitation is based on windowed statistical examination of the vibration signal to determine the optimum triggering voltage level. according to this approach, this paper presents a modified method and for the first time presents a novel circuit structure to predict the optimum trigger time of the damping switch. this circuit structure is implementable using compact analog devices which can be embedded in the vibration energy extraction system. the proposed circuit calculates statistical parameters of the displacement sensor signal then estimates the value of the threshold. results for a cantilever beam excited by different excitation forces, such as harmonic, random samples and pulse forces are presented and compared with the numerical simulations.

control_engineering	decisions made in the early design phase enormously contribute to the performance of a product during its life cycle. since users' preferences may change over time, a product design should be revised under the preference change. providing accurate data for designers ensures an optimal decision for product design; this research presents a new method to assess effects of the quantified changes on product cost and development time. in addition, two models to optimize design under unexpected disturbances are proposed. normally, optimal parameters require several search iterations in design process before finalizing a product. the design time in terms of number of iterations can be reduced by adding resources in each iteration using modern control engineering methods. however, adding resources will increase the design cost. the proposed method in this research minimizes the total product design cost and environmental impacts under changes of users' preferences. the method is validated using an example of the smartphone design. the research novelty is a method of applying quantified changes of external disturbances (such as changes in users' preferences) in the design process, addressing a real problem in industry, and proposing optimal models of products for reduced cost and environmental impacts.

electric_motor	a hybrid safety injection tank (h-sit) can enhance the capability of an advanced power reactor plus (apr+) during a station black out (sbo) that is accompanied by a severe accident. it may a useful alternative to an electric motor. the operations strategy of the h-sit has to be investigated to achieve maximum utilization of its function. in this study, the master logic diagram (i.e., an analysis for identifying the differences between an h-sit and a safety injection pump) and an accident case classification were used to determine the parameters of the h-sit operation. the conditions that require the use of an h-sit were determined using a decision-making process. the proper timing for using an h-sit was also analyzed by using the multi-dimensional analysis of reactor safety (mars) 1.3 code (korea atomic energy research institute, daejeon, south korea). the operation strategy analysis indicates that a h-sit can mitigate five types of failure: (1) failure of the safety injection pump, (2) failure of the passive auxiliary feedwater system, (3) failure of the depressurization system, (4) failure of the shutdown cooling pump (scp), and (5) failure of the recirculation system. the results of the mars code demonstrate that the time allowed for recovery can be extended when using an h-sit, compared with the same situation in which an h-sit is not used. based on the results, the use of an h-sit is recommended, especially after the pilot-operated safety relief valve (posrv) is opened. copyright (c) 2015, published by elsevier korea llc on behalf of korean nuclear society.
pid_controller	a novel proportional-integral-derivative-based fuzzy neural network (pid-based fnn) controller is proposed in this study to control the speed of a vane-type air motor (vam) servo system for tracking periodic speed command. first, the structure and operating principles of the vam servo system are introduced. then, the dynamics of the vam servo system is analyzed to derive the second-order state equation of the vam. moreover, due to the dynamic characteristics and system parameters of the vam servo system are highly nonlinear and time-varying, a pid-based fnn controller, which integrates conventional proportional-integral-derivative neural network (pidnn) control with fuzzy rules, is proposed to achieve precise speed control of vam servo system under the occurrences of the inherent nonlinearities and external disturbances. the network structure and its on-line learning algorithm using delta adaptation law are described in detail. meanwhile, the convergence analysis of the speed tracking error is given using the discrete-type lyapunov function. to enhance the control performance of the proposed intelligent control approach, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (dsp), tms320f28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed control system. finally, experimental results are illustrated to show the validity and advantages of the proposed pid-based fnn controller for vam servo system.
electrical_network	the accurate monitoring of battery cell temperature is indispensible to the design of battery thermal management system. to obtain the internal temperature of a battery cell online, an adaptive temperature estimation method based on kalman filtering and an equivalent time-variant electrical network thermal (eent) model is proposed. the eent model uses electrical components to simulate the battery thermodynamics, and the model parameters are obtained with a least square algorithm. with a discrete state-space description of the eent model, a kalman filtering (kf) based internal temperature estimator is developed. moreover, considering the possible time-varying external heat exchange coefficient, a joint kalman filtering (jkf) based estimator is designed to simultaneously estimate the internal temperature and the external thermal resistance. several experiments using the hard-cased lifepo4 cells with embedded temperature sensors have been conducted to validate the proposed method. validation results show that, the eent model expresses the battery thermodynamics well, the kf based temperature estimator tracks the real central temperature accurately even with a poor initialization, and the jkf based estimator can simultaneously estimate both central temperature and external thermal resistance precisely. the maximum estimation errors of the kf- and jkf-based estimators are less than 1.8 degrees c and 1 degrees c respectively.

microcontroller	as clean and high energy efficient, the microwave drying system has gained popularity for a wide variety of food preservation and processing of bio-commodities. the main advantage is the acceleration of the drying process which is quite limited comparing to conventional hot air drying system. however, during microwave drying process, pressure and temperature will increase continuously and this might cause undesired side effects such as degradation and physical damages. in order to eliminate the mentioned problems and enhance higher performance of control system flexibility, in this paper, a design of multi-stage phase-controlled converter for microwave drying system is proposed. the objective of this multi-stage power control is to track the drying characteristics under microwave drying process at different power level depending on the stage of drying cycle period. this control approach is achieved by controlling the triggering events at appropriate phase angle of triac based on predefined power profiles. by varying the pulse width, the average power output of the magnetron can be controlled. as the focus of this paper, the hardware design and component selections are discussed. the system flowchart and control algorithm based on microcontroller arduino mega 2560 are also presented in details. experimental results of the proposed multi-stage phased-control converter are investigated and discussed.
electrical_circuits	a new method of reliability monitoring of electrical devices based on carbon fibres is presented. due to the thermo-mechanical stress on electronic circuits a loss of fibre network integrity can take place and potential difference may appear between the edges of broken carbon fibres. this potential difference causes an intensive field-emission from surfaces of these broken carbon fibres and an acceleration of emitted electrons. due to the acceleration of electrons a microwave emission is generated. a cfrp was used to simulate the behaviour of a carbon based electronic device. the sequence of microwave impulses was detected in a frequency bandwidth from 8 to 12 ghz. the rise time of detected microwave impulses is about of few nanoseconds. this time is in agreement with crack formation time in carbon fibre. the correlation between the change of electrical resistance of composites and microwave impulses by fibres fracture is observed. thus, the breakdown of current that flows through carbon fibres induces detectable microwave emission. that means that defects in electrical circuits can be wireless detected online.

electricity	the physicochemical properties of anode material are important for the electron transfer of anode bacteria and electricity generation of microbial fuel cells (mfcs). in this work, carbon cloth anode was pretreated with isopropanol, hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and sodium hypochlorite (naocl) in order to reduce the anode functional groups. the influence of functional groups on the electrochemical properties of carbon cloth anode and power generation of mfcs was investigated. the anode pretreatments removed the surface sizing layer of carbon cloth and substantially reduced the contents of c-o and pyridinic/pyrrolic n groups on the anode. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry analyses of the biofilm-matured anodes revealed an enhanced electrochemical electron transfer property because of the anode pretreatments. as compared with the untreated control (612 +/- 6mwm(-2)), the maximum power density of an acetate-fed single-chamber mfc was increased by 26% (773 +/- 5mwm(-2)) with the isopropanol treated anode. additional treatment with h2o2 and naocl further increased the maximum power output to 844 +/- 5mwm(-2) and 831 +/- 4 mwm(-2). a nearly inverse liner relationship was observed between the contents of c-o and pyridinic/pyrrolic n groups on anodes and the anodic exchange current density and the power output of mfcs, indicating an adverse effect of these functional groups on the electricity production of anodes. results from this study will further our understanding on the microbial interaction with carbon-based electrodes and provide an important guidance for the modification of anode materials for mfcs in future studies. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.

digital_control	field programmable gate arrays (fpgas) have established themselves as one of the preferred digital implementation platforms in a plethora of current industrial applications, and extensions and improvements are still continuously being included in the devices. this paper reviews recent advancements in fpga technology, emphasizing the novel features that may significantly contribute to the development of more efficient digital systems for industrial applications. special attention is paid to the design paradigm shift caused by the availability of increasingly powerful embedded (and soft) processors, which transformed fpgas from hardware accelerators to very powerful system-on-chip (soc) platforms. new analog resources, floating-point operators, and hard memory controllers are also described, because of the great advantages they provide to designers. software tools are being strongly influenced by the design paradigm shift, which requires fromthem a much better support for software developers. focusing mainly on this issue, recent advancements in software resources [intellectual property (ip) cores and design tools] are also reviewed. the impact of new fpga features in industrial applications is analyzed in detail in three main areas, namely digital real-time simulation, advanced control techniques, and electronic instrumentation, with focus on mechatronics, robotics, and power systems design. the way digital systems are being currently designed in these areas is comprehensively reviewed, and a critical analysis of how they could significantly benefit from new fpga features is presented.

pid_controller	this study aims to mathematical modeling of a mechanism for a solar tracker system of two axes as well as the modeling of stepper motors that drive each axis, that to get the best angle of incidence between the sun and photovoltaic plate (90o). the proposed architecture was modeled using the conversion method of the kinetic energy and potential of lagrange and stepper motors were modeled by detailed analysis of their internal characteristics. with ready models, we used the software matlab (r) to perform simulations in order to view the system response to the step. as engine speed is too high the system response is oscillatory, the need of using a pid controls system to improve system position control efficiency. for this, we used the second method of ziegler and nichols for determining the parameters of the pid controller gains. thus, the system modeling was completed through the fine tuning of the pid controller in order to find the best values for the controller parameters using the embedded system arduino uno r3.
analog_signal_processing	in this study, a new versatile active element, namely multifunction current differencing cascaded transconductance amplifier (mcdcta) is proposed. the proposed mcdcta enjoys the advantages of low voltage, low-input and high-output impedance, wide bandwidth etc., and it simplifies the design of the current-mode analog signal processing circuit greatly, especially the design of high-order filter and oscillator circuits. moreover, an example, a new current-mode multiphase sinusoidal oscillator (mso) using the proposed mcdcta is described in this paper. the proposed mso consists only one mcdcta and minimum grounded passive elements, it could provide 2n (n a parts per thousand 2) output current signals with equally phase difference, and the output current signals are all at high output impedance terminals. the oscillation condition and the oscillation frequency of the mso could be linearly and electronically adjusted by controlling the bias currents of mcdcta, and it is suitable for variable frequency oscillator application. the operation of the proposed oscillator has been verified through pspice simulation and experimental results.
pid_controller	the recco control algorithm, presented in this article, is based on the fuzzy rule-based (frb) system named anya which has non-parametric antecedent part. it starts with zero fuzzy rules (clouds) in the rule base and evolves its structure while performing the control of the plant. for the consequent part of recco pid-type controller is used and the parameters are adapted in an online manner. the recco does not require any off-line training or any type of model of the controlled process (e.g. differential equations). moreover, in this article we propose a normalization of the cloud (data) space and an improved adaptation law of the controller. due to the normalization some of the evolving parameters can be fixed while the new adaptation law improves the performance of the controller in the starting phase of the process control. to assess the performance of the recco algorithm, firstly a comparison study with classical pid controller was performed on a model of a plate heat-exchanger (phe). tuning the pid parameters was done using three different techniques (ziegler-nichols, cohen-coon and pole placement). furthermore, a practical implementation of the recco controller for a real phe plant is presented. the phe system has nonlinear static characteristic and a time delay. additionally, the real sensor 's and actuator 's limitations represent a serious problem from the control point of view. besides this, the recco control algorithm autonomously learns and evolves the structure and adapts its parameters in an online unsupervised manner.

system_identification	this article deals with the ability of fractional modeling to describe the bounded diffusion behavior encountered in modern thin film and nanoparticles lithium battery electrodes. indeed, the diffusion impedance of such batteries behaves as a half order integrator characterized by the warburg impedance at high frequencies and becomes a classical integrator described by a capacitor at low frequencies. the transition between these two behaviors depends on the particles geometry. three of them will be considered in this paper: planar, cylindrical and spherical ones. the fractional representation proposed is a gray box model able to perfectly fit the low and high frequency diffusive impedance behaviors while optimizing the frequency response transition. identification results are provided using frequential simulation data considering the three electrochemical diffusion models based on the particles geometry. furthermore, knowing this geometry allows to estimate the diffusion ionic resistance and time constant using the relationships linking these physical parameters to the structural fractional model parameters. finally, other simulations using randles impedance models including the charge transfer impedance and the external resistance demonstrate the interest of fractional modeling in order to identify properly not only the charge transfer impedance but also the diffusion physical parameters whatever the particles geometry.

electricity	a comparative analysis of electricity and gas demand in the industrial sector over a long period of time appears to be absent in the literature. in fact, unlike electricity demand, natural gas demand in the industrial sector has not been well researched. our paper aims to cover this gap. it analyses electricity and gas consumption patterns by the spanish manufacturing sector, between 1995 and 2010. a novel and innovative quantitative approach based on, both, homogenous and heterogeneous estimators was used for this purpose. the results of the no-spurious estimations (the augmented mean group estimator) show that the price elasticity of gas demand is significantly negative and within the -0.44 to -0.48 range. in contrast, the price elasticity of electricity demand is not statistically significant. the income elasticities show the opposite pattern: those of natural gas are not statistically significant, whereas the income elasticities for electricity are statistically significant and within the 0.22 to 0.29 range. compared to previous findings, our preferred estimation shows some variation regarding price elasticities of natural gas demand.

analog_signal_processing	micromagnetic materials characterization requires sensors which essentially consist of two critical elements: an electromagnet which introduces a well-defined magnetic field to the material, and a sensor system which detects the material 's response to the applied magnetic field. the devices developed at fraunhofer izfp obtain a multiparametric ""magnetic fingerprint"" with these sensors by means of several methods. the magnetic fingerprints of calibration samples are used as input for pattern recognition or regression analysis, thus allowing the prediction of mechanical-technological material characteristics (hardness, yield strength, etc.) or residual stress. this approach is called micromagnetic multiparameter microstructure and stress analysis (3ma). the long-term stability and reproducibility of the sensor and device characteristics are crucial for the reliability of the measured results. therefore, the measuring hardware should follow a minimalistic approach. in this paper, we propose a way of simplifying the measuring hardware by multiple use of sensor elements, reducing the analog signal processing chain and transferring most signal processing tasks to the pc.

analog_signal_processing	we report on the design and measurements of a multichannel asic fsdr16 prototype implemented in umc 180 nm cmos technology and dedicated for the readout of silicon strip detectors. the fsdr16 chip contains 16 channels with the size of 60 mu m x 880 mu m each, which are built with: charge sensitive amplifier, pole-zero cancellation circuit, 5th order complex shaper based on the follow-the-leader architecture and 7-bit trim dac. to achieve low noise performance and high speed analog signal processing, the proper signal shaping has to be involved in order to obtain voltage pulse which is as symmetrical and short as possible at the shaper output. the functionality of the chip allows to make a comparison between a typical cr-(rc)(5) shaper based on real poles and a complex semi-gaussian shaper based on complex poles. we present both, the design procedure of such filters and the measurements results with the emphasis on the spread of analog front-end parameters of these architectures in the multichannel system. the fsdr16 chip characterizes low power dissipation p-diss = 3.5mw per single channel. the peaking time t(p) measured from 1% to the peak of complex semi-gaussian shaper is set to 75 ns (fast mode) or 180 ns (slow mode). its architecture allows to obtain a shorter pulse width t(w) (t(w)/t(p) = 2.85) measured form 1% to 1% of the curve than in case of a typical cr-(rc)(5) shaper (t(w)/t(p) = 3.54). the front-end electronics has been optimized for detector capacitance of c-det = 30 pf and for fast mode of complex semi-gaussian shaper an equivalent noise charge enc = 172 e(-) + 26.2 e(-)/pf, while for slow mode enc = 139 e(-) + 18.9 e(-)/pf.
microcontroller	in this work the energy harvesting performance of a piezoelectric curved energy generator (thin layer unimorph driver (thunder)) is studied via experimental and analytical methods. the analytical model of the thunder is created based on the linear mechanical electrical constitutive law of the piezoelectric material, the linear elastic constitutive law of the substrate, and the euler-bernoulli beam theory. with these linear modal functions, the rayleigh-ritz approach was used to obtain the reduced mechanical-electrical coupled modulation equations. the analytical model is verified by the experimental results. both the experimental and analytical results of the thunder 's ac power output, dc power output with rectifier bridge and a capacitor, as well as the power output with a microcontroller energy harvesting circuit are reported. based on the theoretical model, the analytical solution of the dc power is derived in terms of the vibration amplitude, frequency, and the electrical load. to harvest energy from low-frequency vibration source by a piezoelectric generator requires the piezoelectric device possessing low resonance frequency and good flexibility. the. thunder developed by langley research center exhibits high power when it is used as an energy generator and large displacement when it is used as an actuator. compared to the less flexible pzt, although thunder is more difficult to model, thunder has better vibration absorption capacity and higher energy recovery efficiency. the effect of the thunder 's radius of curvature on energy harvesting efficiency is mainly investigated. we set the thunder 's radius of curvature as a dynamic tuning parameter which can tune the piezoelectric generators' frequency with the source excitation frequency.

electric_motor	improving the estimation accuracy for the energy consumption of electric vehicles (evs) would greatly contribute to alleviating the range anxiety of drivers and serve as a critical basis for the planning, operation, and management of charging infrastructures. to address the challenges in energy consumption estimation encountered due to sparse global positioning system (gps) observations, an estimation model is proposed that considers both the kinetic characteristics from sparse gps observations and the unique attributes of evs: (1) work opposing the rolling resistance; (2) aerodynamic friction losses; (3) energy consumption/generation depending on the grade of the route; (4) auxiliary load consumption; and (5) additional energy losses arising from the unstable power output of the electric motor. two quantities, the average energy consumption per kilometer and the energy consumption for an entire trip, were focused on and compared for model fitness, parameter, and effectiveness, and the latter showed a higher fitness. based on sparse gps observations of 68 evs in aichi prefecture, japan, the traditional linear regression approach and a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression approach were used for model calibration. the proposed model showed a high accuracy and demonstrated a great potential for application in using sparse gps observations to predict the energy consumption of evs.
electricity	a load estimation algorithm based on k-means cluster analysis was developed. the algorithm applies cluster centres - of previously clustered load profiles - and distance functions to estimate missing and future measurements. canberra, manhattan, euclidean, and pearson correlation distances were investigated. several case studies were implemented using daily and segmented load profiles of aggregated smart meters. segmented profiles cover a time window that is less than or equal to 24 h. simulation results show that canberra distance outperforms the other distance functions. results also show that the segmented cluster centres produce more accurate load estimates than daily cluster centres. higher accuracy estimates were obtained with cluster centres in the range of 16-24 h. the developed load 'estimation algorithm can be integrated with state estimation or other network operational tools to enable better monitoring and control of distribution networks.

electricity	this paper investigates the impact of stock market developments on oil and electricity demand of oecd member countries. we conduct different panel data methodologies and use annual data ranging from 1996 to 2011. the overall findings substantiate that income, real prices, size of the stock market and liquidity are important determinants for both oil and electricity demand. we also compute long-run elasticity coefficients by using a simple partial adjustment model (pam) and find that the long run elasticity coefficients are larger than the short run parameters. moreover, our results show that the demand for oil and electricity is inelastic with respect to both own real price and real income over the short-run and the long-run. from a policy making perspective, the findings suggest that potential policy tools to reduce energy consumption may not be useful as the demand for energy is inelastic with respect to energy prices. our results also manifest that although stock market deepening variables do not have a large effect on energy use as energy price and economic growth have, market size and liquidity significantly affect energy consumption. therefore, energy demand estimations based on solely energy price and income may be inaccurate when some stock market development indicators are excluded. the empirical findings of this paper provide further insights for policy makers, energy companies and energy economists in terms of demand management policies and pricing decisions.
electrical_network	multimodal damping can be achieved by coupling a mechanical structure to an electrical network exhibiting similar modal properties. focusing on a plate, a new topology for such an electrical analogue is found from a finite difference approximation of the kirchhoff-love theory and the use of the direct electromechanical analogy. discrete models based on element dynamic stiffness matrices are proposed to simulate square plate unit cells coupled to their electrical analogues through two-dimensional piezoelectric transducers. a setup made of a clamped plate covered with an array of piezoelectric patches is built in order to validate the control strategy and the numerical models. the analogous electrical network is implemented with passive components as inductors, transformers and the inherent capacitance of the piezoelectric patches. the effect of the piezoelectric coupling on the dynamics of the clamped plate is significant as it creates the equivalent of a multimodal tuned mass damping. an adequate tuning of the network then yields a broadband vibration reduction. in the end, the use of an analogous electrical network appears as an efficient solution for the multimodal control of a plate.
microcontroller	the paper considers a realization of quasi-sliding mode control for dc-dc boost-type converter on atmega8 microcontroller. the proposed control law represents a combination of discretetime sliding mode and generalized minimum variance control techniques. the control design is based on input-output converter model and only the sensed output voltage is used for generating control signal. this approach simplifes the practical realization of boost converter since there is no need for current sensors. by introducing an additional discrete-time integrator in control, the converter accuracy in steady-state under load and input voltage variations is enhanced. the experimental prototype is developed and several experiments are conducted to validate the functionalities of the proposed solution. the maximum load and line regulation errors of the proposed converter are 1.55% and 2.9%, respectively.
control_engineering	with increasingly strict requirements for control speed and system performance, the unavoidable time delay becomes a serious problem. fractional-order feedback is constantly adopted in control engineering due to its advantages, such as robustness, strong de-noising ability and better control performance. in this paper, the dynamical characteristics of an autonomous duffing oscillator under fractional-order feedback coupling with time delay are investigated. at first, the first-order approximate analytical solution is obtained by the averaging method. the equivalent stiffness and equivalent damping coefficients are defined by the feedback coefficient, fractional order and time delay. it is found that the fractional-order feedback coupling with time delay has the functions of both delayed velocity feedback and delayed displacement feedback simultaneously. then, the comparison between the analytical solution and the numerical one verifies the correctness and satisfactory precision of the approximately analytical solution under three parameter conditions respectively. the effects of the feedback coefficient, fractional order and nonlinear stiffness coefficient on the complex dynamical behaviors are analyzed, including the locations of bifurcation points, the stabilities of the periodic solutions, the existence ranges of the periodic solutions, the stability of zero solution and the stability switch times. it is found that the increase of fractional order could make the delay-amplitude curves of periodic solutions shift rightwards, but the stabilities of the periodic solutions and the stability switch times of zero solution cannot be changed. the decrease of the feedback coefficient makes the amplitudes and ranges of the periodic solutions become larger, and induces the stability switch times of zero solution to decrease, but the stabilities of the periodic solutions keep unchanged. the sign of the nonlinear stiffness coefficient determines the stabilities and the bending directions of delay-amplitude curves of periodic solutions, but the bifurcation points, the stability of zero solution and the stability switch times are not changed. it could be concluded that the primary system parameters have important influences on the dynamical behavior of duffing oscillator, and the results are very helpful to design, analyze or control this kind of system. the analysis procedure and conclusions could provide a reference for the study on the similar fractional-order dynamic systems with time delays.

digital_control	in the study of engineering, experimentation plays a great role in understanding the concepts. teaching in engineering is always challenging as theoretical study should be augmented with experiments so that students get a feel of the real life applications of the concepts they study. automation and control laboratory is an area where students can not verify the ladder diagrams; they develop for various applications, unless they have a programmable logic controller, plc in the lab. but the new concept of virtual lab has enabled us to teach the concepts of ladder diagrams and development of control systems using plc very easily. students could develop ladder diagrams and design digital control systems using the simulation environment given in the virtual lab platform and implement the logics developed by them. study carried out at institute and the exit surveys shows that the students are more convinced about the results, as they could test them on a platform.
pid_controller	a disrupted oppositional based gravitational search algorithm (dogsa) tuned sliding mode controller (smc) is proposed in this study for the solution of automatic generation control of interconnected multi-area power system under deregulated environment. the novelty of the control scheme is established by performing the sensitivity analysis under different conditions such as variation of the system load, turbine time constant, governor time constant and tie-line power coefficient. the dynamic response of the system under consideration is also studied and analysed in the presence of non-linear constraints namely generation rate constraint with reheat steam turbine, governor deadband and time delay during signal processing. further, in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed dogsa tuning over the genetic algorithm and differential evolution tuned schemes reported in the literature, it is also employed to tune the integral (i), proportional-integral (pi), integral-derivative (id) and proportional integral derivative (pid) controllers. moreover, the performance of the optimised smc scheme is also compared with i, pi, id and pid controllers. the comparative results reveal that smc scheme tuned using dogsa gives better results than the conventional controllers.
pid_controller	this paper is devoted to the problem of regulating the heart rate response along a predetermined reference profile, for cycle-ergometer exercises designed for training or cardio-respiratory rehabilitation. the controller designed in this study is a non-conventional, non-model-based, proportional, integral and derivative (pid) controller. the pid controller commands can be transmitted as biofeedback auditory commands, which can be heard and interpreted by the exercising subject to increase or reduce exercise intensity. however, in such a case, for the purposes of effectively communicating to the exercising subject a change in the required exercise intensity, the timing of this feedback signal relative to the position of the pedals becomes critical. a feedback signal delivered when the pedals are not in a suitable position to efficiently exert force may be ineffective and this may, in turn, lead to the cognitive disengagement of the user from the feedback controller. this note examines a novel form of control system which has been expressly designed for this project. the system is called an ""actuator-based event-driven control system"". the proposed control system was experimentally verified using 24 healthy male subjects who were randomly divided into two separate groups, along with cross-validation scheme. a statistical analysis was employed to test the generalisation of the pid tunes, derived based on the average transfer functions of the two groups, and it revealed that there were no significant differences between the mean values of root mean square of the tracking error of two groups (3.9 vs. 3.7 bpm, ). furthermore, the results of a second statistical hypothesis test showed that the proposed pid controller with novel synchronised biofeedback mechanism has better performance compared to a conventional pid controller with a fixed-rate biofeedback mechanism (group 1: 3.9 vs. 5.0 bpm, group 2: 3.7 vs. 4.4 bpm, ).
microcontroller	the continuous growth of the internet of things in recent years has meant it is increasingly more present, as internet of things scenarios such as smart homes and smart cities become part of our everyday lives. the internet of things devices involved can be divided into two categories in most internet of things scenarios. the devices can constitute a black box with specific sensors which complicates their configuration, for example, wearable products. other internet of things devices can be composed through configurable microcontrollers, enabling customizable environments to be designed. however, the necessary tools and knowledge for programming and configuring microcontrollers are not accessible to everyone. this article proposes a run-time deployment and management system through the constrained application protocol that bridges the gap between end users and customizable environments. with our system, end users can incorporate new sensors or actuators in their installed microcontroller without having to access and program the microcontroller board. rather, they can manage the resources of the constrained application protocol servers through an accessible and transparent web user interface.

signal-flow_graph	this paper proposes a static linear behavior (slb) analog fault model for switched-capacitor (sc) circuits. the sc circuits under test (cut) are divided into functional macros including the operational amplifiers, the capacitors, and the switches. each macro has specified design parameters from the design 's perspectives. these design parameters constitute a parameter set which determines the practical transfer function of the cut. the slb fault model defines that a cut is faulty if its parameter set results in transfer functions whose frequency responses are out of the design specification. we analyzed the fault effects of the macros and derived their faulty signal-flow graph models with which the faulty transfer function templates of the cut can be automatically generated. based on the templates, we proposed a test procedure that can estimate all the parameters in the parameter set so as to test the cut with multiple faults. different from conventional single fault assumption, the proposed slb fault model covers concurrent multiple parametric faults and catastrophic faults. in addition, it does not need to conduct fault simulations before test as conventional analog fault models do. as a result, it addresses the impractically long fault simulation time issue. a fully-differential low-pass sc biquad filter was adopted as an example to demonstrate how to design and use efficient multitone tests to test for the parameter set. the multitone test results acquired during the test procedure also reveal the distortion and noise performance of the cut though the slb fault model does not include them.
electricity	an ultimate goal for those engaged in research to develop implantable medical devices is to develop mechatronic implantable artificial organs such as artificial pancreas. such devices would comprise at least a sensor module, an actuator module, and a controller module. for the development of optimal mechatronic implantable artificial organs, these modules should be self-powered and autonomously operated. in this study, we aimed to develop a microcontroller using the biocapacitor principle. a direct electron transfer type glucose dehydrogenase was immobilized onto mesoporous carbon, and then deposited on the surface of a miniaturized au electrode (7 mm(2)) to prepare a miniaturized enzyme anode. the enzyme fuel cell was connected with a 100 mu f capacitor and a power boost converter as a charge pump. the voltage of the enzyme fuel cell was increased in a stepwise manner by the charge pump from 330 mv to 3.1 v, and the generated electricity was charged into a 100 mu f capacitor. the charge pump circuit was connected to an ultra-low-power microcontroller. thus prepared biocapacitor based circuit was able to operate an ultra-low-power microcontroller continuously, by running a program for 17 h that turned on an led every 60 s. our success in operating a microcontroller using glucose as the sole energy source indicated the probability of realizing implantable self-powered autonomously operated artificial organs, such as artificial pancreas.

electricity	to response to the increasing demands for clean water, a large pressurized water reactor (pwr) with a desalination capability has been studied and demonstrated its potential so far. however, the electricity production of the large nuclear reactor decreases by 10% due to steam bypass for desalination. in this study, the authors evaluate the possibility of a large pwr with a capability of producing both electric power and clean water by using the supercritical co2 (s-co2) brayton cycle technology. the s-co2 power technology is adopted to minimize the decrease in the electricity production capacity due to desalination process. two concepts which replace the existing steam based power conversion system with a s-co2 brayton cycle were proposed. the first concept is that the low pressure steam turbine section of the power conversion system is replaced with the s-co2 brayton cycle. the second concept is that the whole steam based power conversion system is replaced with the s-co2 brayton cycle. several s -co2 cycle options were considered in terms of power production and the desalination capacity and conducted a comparative analysis of selected layouts and the optimal operating conditions of the suggested layouts were identified.

pid_controller	in this article, an optimized pid controller for a fuel cell is introduced. it should be noted that we did not compute the pid controller 's coefficients based on trial-and-error method; instead, imperialist competitive algorithms have been considered. at first, the problem will be formulated as an optimization problem and solved by the mentioned algorithm, and optimized results will be obtained for pid coefficients. then one of the important kinds of fuel cells, called proton exchange membrane fuel cell, is introduced. in order to control the voltage of this fuel cell during the changes in the charges, an optimal controller is introduced, based on the imperialist competitive algorithm. in order to apply this algorithm, the problem is written as an optimization problem which includes objectives and constraints. to achieve the most desirable controller, this algorithm is used for problem solving. simulations confirm the better performance of proposed pid controller.
state_space_representation	in order to adapt to a milling machines changing behavior while operating due to changing tool-workpiece contact conditions adaptive controllers are an advantageous approach to control the machines feed rate. otherwise inaccuracies can occur leading to poor quality. in this paper model predictive control (mpc) is used to control the feed rate of the machine. by applying a parameterized model to the current state of the milling process its future trend can be predicted. an n-th order system with delay time is used to model the behavior of the milling machines velocity control loop. by continually re-estimating the model parameters at run time, the controller adapts to the current machine behavior. we developed solutions of the maximum likelihood estimators of the models independent parameters for a state-space representation that can be numerically efficiently calculated. these estimators can be used to estimate the parameters of the n-th order system and the delay time iteratively based on the collected process data. two validation studies, one emulating an online estimation based on real data from the five-axis machining center mazak variaxis 630ii-t, and one simulation study with a simulated machine, were carried out to validate the iterative parameter estimation algorithm. in these studies, the time variant model, whose parameters are re-estimated on the basis of the developed estimators, is compared to a time invariant model, for which the controller does not adapt to changing machine behavior.

microcontroller	this paper presents a comparison between the performances of different interleaving control methods for gallium nitride devices-based mhz critical conduction mode (crm) totem-pole power factor correction (pfc) circuit. both closed-loop interleaving and open-loop interleaving are good for the 70-khz crm pfc; but for a mhz frequency crm pfc with microcontroller (mcu) implementation, the open-loop interleaving outperforms the closed-loop interleaving with only a small and nonamplified phase error. after software optimization, the phase error of the open-loop interleaving is smaller than 3 degrees at 1 mhz, when the control is implemented by a 60-mhz low-cost mcu. significant ripple cancellation effect and differential-mode (dm) filter size reduction are achieved with good interleaving. for a 1.2-kw mhz totem-pole pfc, the dm filter size is reduced to one quarter when compared with the counterpart of a 100-khz pfc. last but not least, the stability of the open-loop interleaving is also analyzed indicating that the mhz crm totem-pole pfc with voltage-mode control, open-loop interleaving, and turn-on instant synchronization can maintain critical mode operation with better stability compared with the 70-khz crm pfc.

microcontroller	timing abilities are often measured by having participants tap their finger along with a metronome and presenting tap-triggered auditory feedback. these experiments predominantly use electronic percussion pads combined with software (e.g., ftap or max/msp) that records responses and delivers auditory feedback. however, these setups involve unknown latencies between tap onset and auditory feedback and can sometimes miss responses or record multiple, superfluous responses for a single tap. these issues may distort measurements of tapping performance or affect the performance of the individual. we present an alternative setup using an arduino microcontroller that addresses these issues and delivers low-latency auditory feedback. we validated our setup by having participants (n = 6) tap on a force-sensitive resistor pad connected to the arduino and on an electronic percussion pad with various levels of force and tempi. the arduino delivered auditory feedback through a pulse-width modulation (pwm) pin connected to a headphone jack or a wave shield component. the arduino 's pwm (m = 0.6 ms, sd = 0.3) and wave shield (m = 2.6 ms, sd = 0.3) demonstrated significantly lower auditory feedback latencies than the percussion pad (m = 9.1 ms, sd = 2.0), ftap (m = 14.6ms, sd = 2.8), and max/msp (m = 15.8 ms, sd = 3.4). the pwm and wave shield latencies were also significantly less variable than those from ftap and max/msp. the arduino missed significantly fewer taps, and recorded fewer superfluous responses, than the percussion pad. the arduino captured all responses, whereas at lower tapping forces, the percussion pad missed more taps. regardless of tapping force, the arduino outperformed the percussion pad. overall, the arduino is a high-precision, low-latency, portable, and affordable tool for auditory experiments.
pid_controller	to assess the influence of ship-bank interactions on the course keeping ability of ships, planar motion mechanism (pmm) tests on a scale model of the kvlcc2 tanker were conducted in a circulating water channel (cwc) at different ship-bank distances and speeds. to characterize the asymmetric hydrodynamic features, the asymmetric hydrodynamic derivatives are defined and are measured by the straight towing test with off-centerline displacements. the change in the linear hydrodynamic derivatives due to ship-bank interactions is discussed. the state-space equations are derived from the linear equations of maneuvering motion, which include the asymmetric hydrodynamic derivatives. the linear quadratic regulator (lqr) is adopted to provide the rudder angle and the variation in forward speed during the course keeping process. the simulation results with varying ship-bank separations show that the lqr is more suitable than the classical proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller for the course keeping of the kvlcc2 in the scenario discussed.
signal-flow_graph	we propose a novel design of optical buffer to generate slow light based on delay time. in the framework of the nonlinear waveguide, we investigate propagation of solitons through microring resonators. dynamical control over slow-light solitons is realized via controlling fields generated by bright soliton and gaussian pulse. the nonlinear dependence of the velocity of the signal on the controlling field is analytically described. the buffering effect is achieved by slowing the optical signal using an external control light source to vary the dispersion characteristic of the medium via microring resonators. a graphical approach with a signal flow graph method is used to derive the optical transfer functions in z-domain of filters. the characteristics of the optical buffer devices including the transmittance and time delay of the through and drop port are simulated. simulated results show the criteria of achieving slow light in semiconductor microring resonators. finally, output signal shows the delay time rate by propagation through the semiconductor microring resonators.

pid_controller	the class of vehicles that can move both in the air and underwater has been of great interest for decades. a novel water-air unmanned vehicle with double quadrotor structure is designed in this study. the air power mechanism works when the vehicle flies in the air, whereas the water power mechanism works when it moves underwater. the water entry process of water-air unmanned vehicle requires accurate attitude and height control, or the vehicle may bounce off or overturn. however, a force resisting its descent known as in-ground effect will affect its stability. the in-ground effect formula of the water entry process is derived by experiments, and the water entry dynamic model is improved at the same time. an active disturbance rejection controller (adrc) is designed for the control of water entry attitude and height. experimental results obtained from the comparison of the adrc and a proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller show that the adrc designed in this study is more robust than the pid controller for the internal coupling and external disturbance on the vehicle. moreover, the adrc can meet the requirements of rapid attitude adjustment and accurate height control.
microcontroller	an insect-like tailless flapping wing micro air vehicle (fw-mav) without feedback control eventually becomes unstable after takeoff. flying an insect-like tailless fw-mav is more challenging than flying a bird-like tailed fw-mav, due to the difference in control principles. this work introduces the design and controlled flight of an insect-like tailless fw-mav, named kubeetle. a combination of four-bar linkage and pulley-string mechanisms was used to develop a lightweight flapping mechanism that could achieve a high flapping amplitude of approximately 190 degrees. clap-and-flings at dorsal and ventral stroke reversals were implemented to enhance vertical force. in the absence of a control surface at the tail, adjustment of the location of the trailing edges at the wing roots to modulate the rotational angle of the wings was used to generate control moments for the attitude control. measurements by a 6-axis load cell showed that the control mechanism produced reasonable pitch, roll and yaw moments according to the corresponding control inputs. the control mechanism was integrated with three sub-micro servos to realize the pitch, roll and yaw controls. a simple pd feedback controller was implemented for flight stability with an onboard microcontroller and a gyroscope that sensed the pitch, roll and yaw rates. several flight tests demonstrated that the tailless kubeetle could successfully perform a vertical climb, then hover and loiter within a 0.3 m ground radius with small variations in pitch and roll body angles.
electric_motor	single-phase induction motors are used in the industry commonly. induction motors are not expensive, so it is a reason to use them. diagnostics of faults is very important. it prevents financial loss and unplanned downtimes causes by faults. in this paper the authors described fault diagnostic techniques of the single-phase induction motor. presented techniques were based on the analysis of thermal images of electric motor. the authors measured and analysed 3 states of the single-phase induction motor. in this paper an original method of the feature extraction of thermal images called moasos (method of area selection of states) was presented. the proposed method - moasos and an image histogram were used to form feature vectors. classification of the obtained vectors was performed by nn (nearest neighbour classifier) and gaussian mixture models (gmm). the described fault diagnostic techniques are useful for reliability of the single-phase induction motors and other rotating electrical machines such as: three-phase induction motors, synchronous motors, dc motors.

control_engineering	the implementation of anticipating driving styles in adaptive cruise control systems promises to considerably reduce fuel consumption of vehicles. as drivers have to accept the optimised driving styles of such systems, which implement longitudinally automated driving, the optimisation results should not deviate strongly from the average driving behaviour. this work presents an approach to the optimisation of the vehicle 's longitudinal dynamics, which is based on a predicted average driving profile. the proposed approach ensures that the optimisation results meet the expectations of drivers by directly accounting for driver 's preferences on weighting up travel time against fuel consumption relative to the average driving profile. based on human decision finding, rational and intuitive planning decisions are modelled in a cost function and represent optimisation constraints. the approach generally includes information from vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (v2x), which is an extension to the state-of-the-art. this study describes the optimisation approach and presents a method to determine suitable optimisation parameters in order to consider driver 's preferences. the optimisation approach is applied in a simulated test drive and improvements in fuel economy are analysed. finally, the authors sketch a reference system architecture to prove the feasibility of the presented approach.
electricity	this paper analyzes the impacts of flexible demands on day-ahead market outcomes in a system with significant wind power production. we use a two-stage stochastic market-clearing model, where the first stage represents the day-ahead market and the second stage represents the real-time operation. on one hand, flexibility of demands is beneficial to the system as a whole since such flexibility reduces the operation cost, but on the other hand, shifts in demands from peak periods to off-peak periods may influence prices in such a way that demands may not be willing to provide flexibility. specifically, we investigate the impacts of different degree of demand flexibility on day-ahead prices. a number of scenarios modeling the uncertainty associated with wind production at the operation stage, and nonconvexities due to start-up costs of generators and their minimum power outputs are taken into account.
electric_motor	in recent years, measurements of total electron content (tec) have gained importance with increasing demand for the gps-based navigation applications in trans-ionospheric communications. to study the variation in ionospheric tec, we used the data obtained from gps ionospheric scintillation and tec monitoring (gistm) system which is in operation at svnit, surat, india (21.16 degrees n, 72.78 degrees e) located at the northern crest of equatorial anomaly region. the data collected (for the low sunspot activity period from august 2008-december 2009) were used to study the diurnal, monthly, seasonal semi-annual and annual variations of tec at surat. it was observed that the diurnal variation at the region reaches its maximum value between 13:00 and 16:00 ist. the monthly average diurnal variations showed that the tec maximizes during the equinox months followed by the winter months, and are lowest during the summer months. the ionospheric range delay to tec for the primary gps signal is 0.162 m per tecu. the diurnal variation in tec shows a minimum to maximum variation of about 5 to 50 tecu (in current low sunspot activity periods). these tec values correspond to range delay variations of about 1 to 9 m at surat. these variations in the range delay will certainly increase in high sunspot activity periods. detected tec variations are also closely related to space weather characterizing quantities such as solar wind and geomagnetic activity indices.
analog_signal_processing	this paper presents a full and partial load exergy analysis of a hybrid sofc-gt power plant. the plant basically consists of: an air compressor, a fuel compressor, several heat exchangers, a radial gas turbine, mixers, a catalytic burner, an internal reforming tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack, bypass valves, an electrical generator and an inverter. the model is accurately described. special attention is paid at the calculation of sofc overpotentials. maps are introduced, and properly scaled, in order to evaluate the partial load performance of turbomachineries. the plant is simulated at full-load and part-load operation, showing energy and exergy flows trough all its components and thermodynamic properties at each key-point. at full-load operation a maximum value of 65.4% of electrical efficiency is achieved. three different part-load strategies are introduced. the off-design operation is achieved handling the following parameters: air mass flow rate, fuel mass flow rate, combustor bypass, gas turbine bypass, avoiding the use of a variable speed control system. results showed that the most efficient part-load strategy corresponded to a constant value of the fuel to air ratio. on the other hand, a lower value of net electrical power (34% of nominal load) could be achieved reducing fuel flow rate, at constant air flow rate. this strategy produces an electrical efficiency drop that becomes 45%.

microcontroller	most automatic steering systems for large tractors are designed with hydraulic systems that run on either constant flow or constant pressure. such designs are limited in adaptability and applicability. moreover, their control valves can unload in the neutral position and eventually lead to serious hydraulic leakage over long operation periods. in response to the problems noted above, a multifunctional automatic hydraulic steering circuit is presented. the system design is composed of a 5-way-3-position proportional directional valve, two pilot-controlled check valves, a pressure-compensated directional valve, a pressure-compensated flow regulator valve, a load shuttle valve, and a check valve, among other components. it is adaptable to most open-center systems with constant flow supply and closed-center systems with load feedback. the design maintains the lowest pressure under load feedback and stays at the neutral position during unloading, thus meeting the requirements for steering. the steering controller is based on proportional-integral-derivative (pid) running on a 51-microcontroller-unit master control chip. an experimental platform is developed to establish the basic characteristics of the system subject to stepwise inputs and sinusoidal tracking. test results show that the system design demonstrates excellent control accuracy, fast response, and negligible leak during long operation periods.
digital_control	an indirect hysteresis voltage digital control is proposed for single-phase half-bridge inverters. because of the slow response to the switching modulation, it is difficult to control the voltage by hysteresis method directly. in this study, the output voltage is controlled indirectly by using the adaptive band hysteresis current control, which is fast response, robustness, and independent on the system parameters. the reference current is computed based on the desired reference output voltage, and the hysteresis band is controlled to maintain the switching frequency at a constant value. simulation results show good performances of the proposed control method in both cases: ac and dc reference output voltage.
state_space_representation	this article addresses the problem of active structural vibration control by means of embedded piezoelectric actuators. the topology optimization method using the solid isotropic material with penalization (simp) approach is employed in this work to find the optimum design of actuators taken into account the control spillover effects. a coupled finite element model of the structure is derived assuming a two-phase material and this structural model is written into the state-space representation. the proposed optimization formulation aims to determine the distribution of piezoelectric material which maximizes the controllability for a given vibration mode. the undesirable effects of the feedback control on the residual modes are limited by including a spillover constraint term containing the residual controllability gramian eigenvalues. the optimization of the shape and placement of the conventionally embedded piezoelectric actuators are performed using a sequential linear programming (slp) algorithm. numerical examples are presented considering the control of the bending vibration modes for a cantilever and a fixed beam. a linear-quadratic regulator (lqr) is synthesized for each case of controlled structure in order to compare the influence of the additional constraint.

electrical_circuits	it was investigated the physical processes in the molecules, which have properties required in case of using as molecular switches, transistors, or other electronic elements of future computers. studies show that in the molecules of biphenyl substituents the angle between the planes of the phenyl rings depends on the magnitude of the applied external electric field. so, the ratio of squares of cosines of the angles between the phenyl groups in the field 0.01 a.u. and without field reaches 18. it significantly changes the ability of electrons to move along the long axis of the molecule. by varying the nature of the substituents, we can obtain the molecule characteristics that make these molecules promising for future using. this effect provides the use of biphenyl substitutes as transistors in electrical circuits constructed on separate molecules.
control_engineering	pid controller structure is regarded as a standard in the control-engineering community and is supported by a vast range of automation hardware. therefore, pid controllers are widely used in industrial practice. however, the problem of tuning the controller parameters has to be tackled by the control engineer and this is often not dealt with in an optimal way, resulting in poor control performance and even compromised safety. the paper proposes a framework, which involves using an interval model for describing the uncertain or variable dynamics of the process. the framework employs a particle swarm optimization algorithm for obtaining the best performing pid controller with regard to several possible criteria, but at the same time taking into account the complementary sensitivity function constraints, which ensure robustness within the bounds of the uncertain parameters' intervals. hence, the presented approach enables a simple, computationally tractable and efficient constrained optimization solution for tuning the parameters of the controller, while considering the eventual gain, pole, zero and time-delay uncertainties defined using an interval model of the controlled process. the results provide good control performance while assuring stability within the prescribed uncertainty constraints. furthermore, the controller performance is adequate only if the relative system perturbations are considered, as proposed in the paper. the proposed approach has been tested on various examples. the results suggest that it is a useful framework for obtaining adequate controller parameters, which ensure robust stability and favorable control performance of the closed-loop, even when considerable process uncertainties are expected.

digital_control	lcl filters have been widely used for grid-connected inverters. however, the problem that how time delay affects the stability of digitally controlled grid-connected inverters with lcl filters has not been fully studied. in this paper, a systematic study is carried out on the relationship between the time delay and stability of single-loop controlled grid-connected inverters that employ inverter current feedback (icf) or grid current feedback (gcf). the ranges of time delay for system stability are analyzed and deduced in the continuous s-domain and discrete z-domain. it is shown that in the optimal range, the existence of time delay weakens the stability of the icf loop, whereas a proper time delay is required for the gcf loop. the present work explains, for the first time, why different conclusions on the stability of icf loop and gcf loop have been drawn in previous studies. to improve system stability, a linear predictor-based time delay reduction method is proposed for icf, while a time delay addition method is used for gcf. a controller design method is then presented that guarantees adequate stability margins. the delay-dependent stability study is verified by simulation and experiment.
electric_motor	rotational speed measurement is a key issue in most industries, either for process control, characterization or fault diagnosis. in electric motor driven systems it can be used, for example, to estimate the motor load or pulley-belt transmission slip. encoders and resolvers are typically used for continuous speed monitoring, requiring mechanical coupling with the rotating shaft/part. if the speed is to be measured at a given instant or during a few moments, noninvasive contactless optical tachometers can be used, using optical reflection or stroboscopic principles. in most cases, stroboscopic tachometers require no reflective elements/strips in the rotating part. however, if the user wants to continuously measure the speed of a given rotating part during the audit/characterization period, with real-time data logging and without sticking reflective strips or introducing shaft-coupled encoders/resolvers, there is no low-cost commercial solution to perform such task. for example, if the user 's aim is to continuously estimate the load variation of an induction motor over a day or week, on the basis of the slip/speed value, it is not possible with conventional commercial low-cost contactless equipment, unless the user uses expensive online-operation equipment estimating the speed by means of input voltage/current. moreover, in some rotating systems/parts not directly driven by an electric motor, the online equipment cannot be used and it is not practical, and in some cases even impossible, to couple an encoder/resolver or stick some reflective strips. in this paper, an innovative nonintrusive low-cost webcam-based tachometer is proposed, developed and experimentally tested. it can be used to easily estimate and record the speed over time in, for example, electrical motors, pulleys, shafts and wind turbines.
electricity	one of the possible research lines for improving the concentrated solar power (csp) technology is the enhancement of the thermophysical properties of the heat transfer fluids (htf) used. this enhancement leads to reduce costs for producing electricity using this technology. so, this study presents the preparation of nanofluids in which ag nanoparticles were added to a base fluid composed of a eutectic mixture of diphenyl oxide and biphenyl. the base fluid is a heat transfer fluid commonly used in concentrating solar power plants. the nanofluids were shown to have improved thermal properties, the heat transfer coefficient increasing by up to 6% compared with the base fluid. thus, their use could lead to enhancements in the overall efficiency of csp plants. accordingly, nanofluids were prepared with varying nanoparticle concentrations and their properties were characterized, including their physical and chemical stability, viscosity, isobaric specific heat and thermal conductivity. in addition, molecular dynamic calculations were performed to reach a better understanding of the nanofluid system at a molecular level. the isobaric specific heat and thermal conductivity values followed the same experimental tendency. an analysis of the radial distribution functions (rdfs) and spatial distribution functions (sdfs) shows that there is a first layer of base fluid molecules around the metal in which the oxygen atoms play an important role. this first layer encourages the directionality of the movement in the heart of the nanofluid, which leads to enhanced thermal properties.

system_identification	in this study, the author uses parametric models to predict the track geometry-induced dynamic behavior of a vehicle. the characteristics of vehicle dynamics in these models are directly identified through the spatial as opposed to the frequency domain. one of the former 's merits is that we can identify the characteristics of vehicle dynamics with fewer observed points than when we use spectral analysis, making it easier to obtain fewer data set for identification. another is that we can determine the parameters to represent dynamic behavior of a vehicle using statistical criteria. with these models, we can predict vertical acceleration of a vehicle and its wheel load as well as estimate track conditions by taking into account both ride comfort and operating safety.
system_identification	a novel variational bayesian mixture of experts model for robust regression of bifurcating and piece-wise continuous processes is introduced. the mixture of experts model is a powerful model which probabilistically splits the input space allowing different models to operate in the separate regions. however, current methods have no fail-safe against outliers. in this paper, a robust mixture of experts model is proposed which consists of student-t mixture models at the gates and student-t distributed experts, trained via bayesian inference. the student-t distribution has heavier tails than the gaussian distribution, and so it is more robust to outliers, noise and non normality in the data. using both simulated data and real data obtained from the z24 bridge this robust mixture of experts performs better than its gaussian counterpart when outliers are present. in particular, it provides robustness to outliers in two forms: unbiased parameter regression models, and robustness to overfitting/complex models.
analog_signal_processing	this paper presents design of an active building block for analog signal processing, named as current-controlled differential difference current conveyor (ccddcc). its parasitic resistances at x-terminal can be controlled by an input bias current. the proposed element is realized in a cmos technology. it displays usability of the new active element, where the maximum bandwidth of voltage and current followers are around 1ghz, 100mhz, respectively. the thd is obtained around 0.8% within 0.6vpp input range. the power dissipation of a ccddcc at 10 mu a biased current is obtained around 1.35mw with +/- 1.25v power supplies. in addition, current-mode multiple-input single output (miso) second-order universal analog filter is included as the applications. the filter offers the realization of simultaneous five type standard filter responses. the quality factor and the frequency response parameters can be independently tuned. spice simulation results of proposed ccddcc and its applications are also presented.
signal-flow_graph	a novel approach using microresonating system with low power consumption is proposed for determining young 's modulus of mirco and nano-sized waveguide material. based on the mason rule with signal flow graph (sfg) method in the z-domain, the optical transfer function is derived for resonating layout consists of two single microring resonators which are indirectly coupled to an add-drop micro resonator. a mathematical function is determined for critical coupling coefficient and the optimum optical transmission of proposed system. for the resonant mode numbers of 5;3;3, the free spectral range (fsr) is extended to 182 nm with the out of band rejection ratio(obrr) of 50 db and the q factor is 8593. the young 's modulus is determined based on a change in the sensing ring radius due to the applied external force on the waveguide that causes the wavelength shift in resonant peaks. the young 's modulus for the lateral surface of the soi waveguide with 250 nm height and 1.5 mu m radius is determined to be 147.72 gpa and for the upper surface of the soi waveguide with 440 nm average width and 1.5 mu m radius is determined to be 83.93 gpa. the proposed resonating system is a potential candidate for measuring young 's modulus of materials in mirco and nano size with high resolution and has the advantages of the low power consumption due to the low intensity source.
analog_signal_processing	this paper 's domain is the application of well-known modern applied mathematical methods in a control structure of oil industry. electrical submersible pumps (esp) telemetry system allows for the obtaining of information in the neighborhood of different heavy electromagnetic noises. the telemetry system needs to receive accurate information on the pump unit 's intake pressure, temperature and most importantly for the submersible electric motor, the stator cooling oil insulation resistance, for the successful exploitation of the esp. but increasing disturbance levels with the corrupted analog telemetry signal are resulting in increasing noise levels; however, often it is still audible or the control is still reliable. though, beyond a certain disturbance level, the so-called digital cliff, the digital telemetry signal and control may stop abruptly (fig. 1). in this paper, an analog signal processing implementation was researched for the detection of the most efficient adaptive noise-cancelling filters among dozens of recognized ones for oil industry esp telemetry systems of under severely noisy conditions. from ten applied adaptive filter algorithms, only three have shown successfully good results in the early prediction of the esp electric motor real insulation disruption.
microcontroller	sea-level rise is expected to cause saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater wetlands. the resulting changes in the soil environment would likely cause shifts in plant and microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. to simulate saltwater intrusion, we constructed a solar-powered automated irrigation system. the system consisted of holding tanks that were filled with freshwater or artificial brackish water during high tide. during low tide, the water was gravity-fed through solenoid valves and metered out to each plot. this system was controlled by an open-source microcontroller platform and built from off-the-shelf electronics at a cost of $1800. porewater salinity in near-surface soils of the plots receiving brackish water was increased from freshwater to oligohaline levels within one month of operation and was maintained throughout the first summer of operation. this porewater manipulation led to changes in the plant community and in exchanges of carbon dioxide and methane between the marsh and atmosphere. the system has proven to be a reliable way of manipulating wetland salinity for studying changes in the physicochemical environment. with modifications, it could be used to manipulate nutrient loads, hydrology, and sediment supply in other wetland systems.
state_space_representation	long horizon lengths in moving horizon estimation are desirable to reach the performance limits of the full information estimator. however, the conventional mhe technique suffers from a number of deficiencies in this respect. first, the problem complexity scales at least linearly with the horizon length selected, which restrains from selecting long horizons if computational limitations are present. second, there is no monitoring of constraint activity/inactivity which results in conducting redundant constrained minimizations even when no constraints are active. in this study we develop a multiple-window moving horizon estimation strategy (mw-mhe) that exploits constraint inactivity to reduce the problem size in long horizon estimation problems. the arrival cost is approximated using the unconstrained full information estimator arrival cost to guarantee stability of the technique. a new horizon length selection criterion is developed based on the sensitivity between remote states in time. the development will be in terms of general causal descriptor systems, which includes the standard state space representation as a special case. the potential of the new estimation algorithm will be demonstrated with an example showing a significant reduction in both computation time and numerical errors compared to conventional mhe.

control_engineering	on this work, a device was made in order to help the visualization by the student of a pid temperature control and thus fix the concepts learned in the classroom. this device was built primarily with a pic18f4550 microcontroller, a mini cooler from a pc, a heat resistor, lm35 temperature sensors, liquid crystal display, usb connector, transistors, leds, potentiometers, resistors and capacitors. the usb connection is responsible for recording the microcontroller firmware (bootloader mode), for interfacing with a supervisory software, and to supply the system. the heat resistor provides heat to the system. on the other hand, the cooler has the function of removing heat from the system. the liquid crystal display helps the student to check the temperature, the constants of the controller (kp, ki and kd) and the set point temperature or the cooler voltage. the potentiometers provide the option to run the system in open loop, that is, they serve to make the control of the heat supplied by the heat resistor and the cooler voltage manually. both the heat resistor and the cooler are controlled via transistors switched by pwms (pulse wide modulation). a computer program was developed in c sharp language to display the temperature over time measured by the sensors. the program also is used to adjust the constants kp, ki and kd of the controller and the temperature set point. the microcontroller firmware allows the system to operate in both open and closed loop modes. this work allows the student to learn in practice the control actions when the controller parameters are changed, contributing to improve the acknowledgment of control engineering.
electrical_network	this paper presents an algorithm for economic optimization of a laboratory microgrid. the microgrid incorporates a hybrid storage system composed of a battery bank and a hydrogen storage and it has a connection with the external electrical network and a charging station for electric vehicles. to study the impact of use of renewable energy power systems, the microgrid has a programmable power supply that can emulate the dynamic behavior of a wind turbine and/or a photovoltaic field. the system modeling was carried out using the energy hubs methodology. a hierarchical control structure is proposed based on model predictive control and acting in different time scales, where the first level is responsible for maintaining the microgrid stability and the second level has the task of performing the management of electricity purchase and sale to the power grid, maximize the use of renewable energy sources, manage the use of energy storages and perform the charge of the parked vehicles. practical experiments were performed with different weather conditions of solar irradiation and wind. the results show a reliable operation of the proposed control system.

microcontroller	this article presents a new optical, multi-functional, high-resolution 3-axis sensor which serves to navigate and can, for example, replace standard joysticks in medical devices such as electric wheelchairs, surgical robots or medical diagnosis devices. a light source, e.g., a laser diode, is affixed to a movable axis and projects a random geometric shape on an image sensor (cmos or ccd). the downstream microcontroller 's software identifies the geometric shape 's center, distortion and size, and then calculates x, y, and z coordinates, which can be processed in attached devices. depending on the image sensor in use (e.g., 6.41 megapixels), the 3-axis sensor features a resolution of 1544 digits from right to left and 1038 digits up and down. through interpolation, these values rise by a factor of 100. a unique feature is the exact reproducibility (deflection to coordinates) and its precise ability to return to its neutral position. moreover, optical signal processing provides a high level of protection against electromagnetic and radio frequency interference. the sensor is adaptive and adjustable to fit a user 's range of motion (stroke and force). this recommendation aims to optimize sensor systems such as joysticks in medical devices in terms of safety, ease of use, and adaptability.
pid_controller	this article presents the automatic generation control of an unequal three area thermal system. single stage reheat turbines and generation rate constraints of 3%/min are considered in each control area. controllers such as integral (i), proportional - integral (pi), proportional - integral- derivative (pid), and proportional - integral - derivative plus second order derivative.(pid + dd) are treated as secondary controllers separately. a nature inspired optimization technique called ant lion optimizer (alo) algorithm is used for simultaneous optimization of the controller gains. comparison of dynamic responses of frequencies and tie line powers corresponding to alo optimized i, pi, pid and pid + dd controller reveal the better performance of pid + dd controller in terms of lesser settling time, peak overshoots as well as reduced oscillations. robustness of the optimum gains of best controller obtained at nominal conditions is evaluated using sensitivity analysis. analysis exposed that the optimum pid + dd controller gains obtained at nominal are robust and not necessary to reset again for changes in loading, parameter like inertia constant (h), size and position of disturbance. furthermore, the performance of pid + dd controller is found better as compared to pid controller against random loading pattern condition.

electricity	countries are implementing policies to develop greener energy markets worldwide. in europe, the ""2030 energy and climate package"" asks for further reductions of green house gases, renewable sources integration, and energy efficiency targets. but the polluting intensity of electricity may be different in average than when considering market inefficiencies, in particular losses, and therefore the implemented policy must take those differences into account. precisely, herein we study the importance in terms of co2 emissions the extra amount of energy necessary to cover losses. with this purpose we use spanish market and system data with hourly frequency from 2011 to 2013. our results show that indeed electricity losses significantly explain co2 emissions, with a higher co2 emissions rate when covering losses than the average rate of the system. additionally, we find that the market closing technologies used to cover losses have a positive and significant impact on co2 emissions: when polluting technologies (coal or combined cycle) close the market, the impact of losses on co2 emissions is high compared to the rest of technologies (combined heat and power, renewables or hydropower). to the light of these results we make some policy recommendations to reduce the impact of losses on co2 emissions.
electrical_circuits	the current state of art in the literature indicates that linear visual receptive fields are gaussian or formed based on gaussian kernels in biological visual systems. in this paper, by employing hypotheses based on the anatomy and physiology of vertebrate biological vision, we propose a neural circuitry possessing gaussian-related visual receptive fields. here, we present a plausible circuitry system matching the characteristic properties of an ideal visual front end of biological visual systems and then present a condition under which this circuit demonstrates a linear behaviour to model the linear receptive fields observed in the biological experimental data. the objective of this study is to understand the hardware circuitry from which various visual receptive fields in biological visual system can be deduced. in our model, a nonlinear neural network communicating with spikes is considered. the condition under which this neural network behaves linearly is discussed. the equivalent linear circuit proposed here employs some anatomical and physiological properties of the early biological visual pathway to derive the visual receptive field profiles for linear cells such as neurons with isotropic separable, non-isotropic separable and non-separable (velocity-adapted) gaussian receptive fields in the lgn and striate cortex. in the model presented here, the theory of transmission lines for linear distributed electrical circuits is employed for two-dimensional transmission grids to model cell connectivities in a neural layer. the model presented here leads to a formulation similar to the gaussian scale-space theory for the transmission of visual signals through various layers of neurons. our model therefore presents a new insight on how the convolution process with gaussian kernels can be implemented in vertebrate visual systems. the comparison of the numerical simulations of our model presented in this paper with the data analysis of receptive field profiles recorded in the biological literature demonstrates a complete agreement between our theoretical model and experimental data. our model is also in good agreement with the numerical results of the gaussian scale-space theory for the visual receptive fields.
electricity	limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees c requires the transformation of the global energy system at a scale unprecedented since the industrial revolution. to meet this 2 degrees c goal, 87% of integrated assessment models opt for using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (beccs). without beccs, the models predict that the goal will be either unachievable or substantially more costly to meet. while the modeling literature is extensive, studies of how key climate policy actors perceive and prioritize beccs are sparse. this article provides a unique intercontinental mapping of the prioritization of beccs for the long term transition of the electricity supply sector. based on survey responses from 711 un climate change conference delegates, the article reports the low prioritization of beccs relative to alternative technologies, indicating an urgent need for studies of the sociopolitical preconditions for large-scale beccs deployment.
digital_control	the article describes some of the features of the servo amplifier, developed in the nru ""mpei"" for use in multi-axis high-precision materials processing. simplified structure of servo amplifier and some of the key components of servo drive digital control system are presented. two ways of multi-axes control are compared: using the rs-232 interface and digital inputs/outputs, and using the canopen standard based digital can protocol. the benefits of multi-axis control with the canopen protocol are high-speed exchanges, reliability of data transmission, standardization and simple communication topology.
electricity	energy storage is unique in that it can provide multiple services. this feature raises cost-recovery issues for storage, due to the combination of competitive markets and ratebased cost recovery used in many power systems today. this hybrid regulatory paradigm relies on classifying assets as providing competitively prices or unpriced services and handling cost recovery based on that classification. some recent regulatory precedents suggest that storage developers must choose between classifying their assets as providing competitively priced or unpriced services. in the former case, storage costs must be recovered through the market. if an asset is classified as providing only unpriced services, costs can be recovered through the ratebase. this regulatory design can hamper cost recovery for storage and may lead to inefficient storage investment and use. we propose an alternate solution whereby storage-capacity rights are auctioned to third parties that use their rights for priced or unpriced services. storage-capacity rights disentangle storage cost recovery from the regulatory treatment of its end use. we formulate the storage-capacity auction model and demonstrate how to efficiently price storage-capacity rights. we show that the revenues earned by the storage owner through the auction equals the imputed marginal value of storage capacity, as revealed by the market bids.
microcontroller	in the past, human-machine interfacing ( hmi) motivated many studies to develop systems and devices that were able to transfer analog commands from the user 's body to machines. however, many design solutions are still affected by comfort and performance limitations due to wire communications, long calibration procedures, resistance to hand motions, and power supplies requiring cables or batteries. goldfinger, the hmi glove introduced in this paper, has the potential to overcome some of these limitations thanks to the integration of advanced materials, miniaturization of components and electronics, and power generation through biomechanical energy harvesting. hand motions are used to communicate with the machine via a led tracking system. then, information is digitalized with dedicated software that also provides the machine microcontroller programming in the c language. additionally, the battery discharge time is reduced due to the power harvested from integrated piezoelectric transducers, which generate power from finger motions.

analog_signal_processing	a cmos charge amplifier, due to its very low power consumption and good noise performance, has great interest for analog signal processing in the fields of particle physics, nuclear physics and x-or beta-ray detection. the simulation environment of eldo (tm) using ami05 (american microsystems inc.) technology provided by mentor graphics corporation is used for noise optimization of a low power cmos charge amplifier. using simulation tools we have designed and simulated the output of the charge amplifier and have calculated the power consumption, band width, gain and equivalent noise charge (enc) of the circuit. we have also studied the factors on which noise of amplifier depends. this has resulted in a noise performance of enc = 116 electrons at 0 pf detector capacitance with a power consumption of 80 mu w per channel. due to its very low noise and low power consumption, this kind of new charge amplifier can be widely used in research in the fields of particle physics, nuclear physics and x-ray detection.
electricity	the current increase in the deployment of new renewable electricity generation systems is creating new challenges in balancing electric grids. solutions including energy storage at small and large scales are becoming of paramount importance to guarantee and secure a stable supply of electricity. this paper presents a study about a hybrid solution including a large scale energy storage system coupled with power generation and fast responding energy storage systems. the hybrid plant is able to deliver the energy previously stored by using an air liquefaction process either with or without the contribution of additional energy from combustion. the paper also highlights how such hybrid plants may offer the chance of providing the grid with fast control services. an ideal energy storage technology should have a high power rating, a large storage capacity, high efficiency, low costs and no geographic constraints. the use of air as energy carrier has been studied since the 20th century with the first compressed air energy storage (caes) systems. this technology is still considered to have a potential but it is geographically constrained, where suitable geological reservoirs are available, unless compressed air is stored in pressurized tanks with significant costs. liquid air energy storage (laes) represents an interesting solution due to its relatively large volumetric energy density and ease of storage. different process schemes for hybrid plants were modeled in this study with aspen hysys (r) simulation software and the results were compared in terms of equivalent round-trip and fuel efficiencies. equivalent round-trip efficiencies, higher than 80%, have been calculated showing that the proposed configurations might play an important role for power systems balancing in the near future.

analog_signal_processing	the world is presently confronted with the twin crisis of fossil fuel depletion and environmental degradation. indiscriminate extraction and lavish consumption of fossil fuels have led to reduction in underground based carbon resources. the search for an alternative fuel, which promises a harmonious correlation with sustainable development, energy conservation, management, efficiency, and environmental preservation, has become highly pronounced in the present context. for the developing countries of the world, fuels of bio-origin can provide a feasible solution to the crisis. in the present investigation, hydrogen-enriched air was used as intake charge in a cl (compression ignition) engine. experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled, stationary direct-injection diesel engine kirlosker taf1 with 1500 rpm and 4.4 kw capacity coupled to an electrical generator. the injection timings (18.5, 20, 21.5, 24.5, 27.5 degrees ca) and flow rates of hydrogen were varied (80, 120, 150 g/hr) to find out the optimum condition for hydrogen enrichment to meet the best performance. experiment results showed that hydrogen enriched engine gave maximum brake thermal efficiency and minimum brake specific energy consumption at 16.4% h-2 or 120 g/h flow rate with 20 ca injection timing.

signal-flow_graph	in this work, new kerwin-huelsman-newcomb (khn) biquads employing current-controlled current conveyors (ccciis) in voltage-mode (vm) as well as in current-mode (cm) are presented. the parameters of the proposed circuits can be electronically controlled thanks to the tunability properties of the ccciis. the vm circuit is derived from a previously reported one by modifying its summing circuit and replacing the current conveyors (cciis) and resistors at their x-input terminals with ccciis. on the other band, the cm circuit is derived from the adjoint graph of the signal-flow graph corresponding to the classical khn circuit. this circuit is a multi-input single-output cm universal filter, which offers all the main advantages of the cm circuits as well as those of the classical khn circuit. in addition to the three basic filter responses, they also allow the realization of the notch and the allpass responses.
electrical_network	with the growing use of renewable energy sources, distributed generation (dg) systems are rapidly spreading. embedding dg to the distribution network may be costly due to the grid reinforcements and control adjustments required in order to maintain the electrical network reliability. deterministic load flow calculations are usually employed to assess the allowed dg penetration in a distribution network in order to ensure that current or voltage limits are not exceeded. however, these calculations may overlook the risk of limit violations due to uncertainties in the operating conditions of the networks. to overcome this limitation, related to both injection and demand profiles, the present paper addresses the problem of dg penetration with a monte carlo technique that accounts for the intrinsic variability of electric power consumption. the power absorbed by each load of a medium voltage network is characterized by a load variation curve; a probabilistic load flow is then used for computing the maximum dg power that can be connected to each bus without determining a violation of electric constraints. a distribution network is studied and a comparison is provided between the results of the deterministic load flow and probabilistic load flow analyses.

state_space_representation	beside the major objective of providing congestion control, achieving predictable queuing delay, maximizing link utilization, and robustness are the main objectives of an active queue management (aqm) controller. this paper proposes an improved queue dynamic model while incorporating the packet drop probability as well. by applying the improved model, a new compensated pid aqm controller is developed for transmission control protocol/internet protocol (tcp/ip) networks. the non-minimum phase characteristic caused by pade approximation of the network delay restricts the direct application of control methods because of the unstable internal dynamics. in this paper, a parameter-varying dynamic compensator, which operates on tracking error and internal dynamics, is proposed to not only capture the unstable internal dynamics but also reduce the effect of uncertainties by unresponsive flows. the proposed dynamic compensator is then used to design a pid aqm controller whose gains are obtained directly from the state-space representation of the system with no further gain tuning requirements. the packet-level simulations using network simulator (ns2) show the outperformance of the developed controller for both queuing delay stability and resource utilization. the improved underlying model leads also to the faster response of the controller. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.
control_engineering	the aim of this paper is to present experimental validation results to show the design simplicity of single input interval type-2 (it2) fuzzy pid (fpid) controllers by evaluating their performance on a real-time 3 dof helicopter testbed. in this study, we briefly show that the presented analytical design approach gives the opportunity to construct the it2 fuzzy mappings by tuning a single parameter which constructs the footprint of uncertainty (fou) of the it2 fuzzy sets. then, by employing these theoretical analyses, various single input it2 fpid (sit2-fpid) controllers are designed to solve the control problem of the 3 dof helicopter. through extensive and comparative experimental analysis, we analyze the it2 fuzzy control system performances and validate the effect of the fou parameter on the controller characteristics. the experimental results show that, having neither a priori knowledge about the mathematical model of the system nor its parameters, the sit2-fpid is able to achieve a satisfactory control performance over nonlinear working regions in the presence of noise and unmodelled disturbance dynamics. we believe that the experimental validation of the sit2-fpid controllers' theoretical analyses will open the door to a wider deployment of sit2-fpids to real world control engineering applications.
system_identification	accurate evaluation of soil dynamic properties is essential for seismic response analyses of sites. in a number of studies, site properties have been identified using one-dimensional analyses. such analyses uncouple the two-dimensional (horizontal) response of soil deposits, which is inherently coupled. this paper presents a system identification technique that takes into account the coupled two-directional response of soil deposits. the technique employs non-parametric estimates of the shear stresses derived from acceleration records provided by a vertical (downhole) array. a multi-yield surface plasticity approach is used to model the multi-dimensional stress-strain relation. the identification technique is first verified using finite elements computational simulations. this technique was then used to assess the coupled response of the wildlife liquefaction research site (imperial valley, california). the identified shear moduli and shear wave velocities were found to be in a very good agreement with those measured in the field using crosshole seismic testing.
electricity	under increasing penetration of distributed resources, regulators and electricity distribution utilities face greater uncertainty regarding the evolution of network uses and efficient system costs. this uncertainty can threaten revenue adequacy and challenges both cost of service/rate of return and incentive/performance-based approaches to the remuneration of distribution utilities. to address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology to establish allowed utility revenues over a multi-year regulatory period. this method combines several ""state of the art"" regulatory tools designed to overcome information asymmetries, manage uncertainty, and align incentives for utilities to cost-effectively integrate distributed energy resources while taking advantage of opportunities to reduce system costs and improve performance. we use a reference network model to simulate a large-scale urban distribution network, demonstrate the practical application of this regulatory method, and illustrate its performance in the face of both benchmark and forecast errors.
pid_controller	pid control schemes have been widely used in most industrial control systems. however, it is difficult to determine a suitable set of pid parameters because most industrial systems have nonlinearity. in order to overcome such a problem, a data-driven pid (dd-pid) control scheme based on utilizing a database has been proposed and its effectiveness has been investigated. however, the dd-pid controller has two problems. one is that training of the database in an on-line manner takes a long time. the other is that a database requires large amount of memory and high computational cost for some micro-controllers. in order to train a database in an off-line manner, the dd-frit scheme which is a combination of a database and the fictitious reference iterative tuning (frit) scheme has been proposed in a previous research. according to the dd-frit scheme, a dd-pid controller can be trained in an off-line manner by using a set of operating data. in this paper, to address the problem of required memory and computational cost, a method that expresses a dd-pid controller as a simple nonlinear function by using the group method of data handling (gmdh) is proposed. according to the proposed method, a dd-pid controller which is trained in advance by using a set of operating data is replaced by a network constructed in n-adalines (units expressed by a simple nonlinear function). the proposed method is first explained and the effectiveness of the proposed method is numerically evaluated by a simulation example.
microcontroller	single-inductor multiple-output (simo) switching dc-dc power converter architecture is a cost-effective alternative to multiple individual switching power converters solution in many power distribution system applications where multiple voltage rails are required at reduced cost. however, with multiple output voltage rails coupled to the same switching node, the simo power converters suffer from cross regulation between the multiple outputs, which complicates the closed-loop controller design of the simo converter and degrades regulation performance. in this paper, a power-multiplexed (pm) control scheme is proposed aiming to completely decouple the operations of multiple outputs from one another. the proposed pm control scheme results in eliminating the cross regulation among the multiple outputs while maintaining desired voltage regulation performance for each output under both steady-state and dynamic operations. low-cost microcontroller or analog circuitries can be used to implement the proposed controller. experimental proof of concept prototype results verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed controller.
digital_control	the main goal of radiotherapy is to destroy the tumor while minimizing harm to nearby healthy tissue. advances in the digital control have enabled planning and performing accurate treatments. however, todays technology is unable to compensate respiration induced motion, and therefore, ensure sufficient precision. one of the tasks in compensating respiratory motion is predicting position of the functional target ( tumor) from an external marker during fraction. performance of techniques, such as pearson correlation, gaussian filters, fourries transformation, cross correlation, linear interpolation and partial-least squares, still leave plenty space for the improvement. we reports results of work in progress, i.e. experiments of applying different types of regressions to predict motion of functional target from different external markers. results seem to be promising in most of the cases.
electric_motor	this simulation study discusses the application of a multimode combustion engine in a mild hybrid electric vehicle (hev) with three-way catalytic converter (twc). operation in the lean combustion mode homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) results in oxidation of the oxygen storage capacity (osc) of the twc. thereby, the twc 's ability to convert, nox under lean conditions is removed. succeeding depletion of the osc under rich spark-ignition (si) conditions is required, winch results in significant fuel efficiency penalties. in case of a mild hev the torque assist from the electric motor is able to extend the residence time in hcci, thereby reducing the number osc depletion events. the applied supervisory controller, which decides when to switch between si and hcci, is based on the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ecms) and incorporates the fuel penalties associated with mode switching and osc depletion. it is shown that, while the impact of the osc depletion on drive cycle fuel economy of the mild hev is still significant, it is much smaller than in case of the vehicle without electric motor. the prolonged operation in lean hcci mode leads to substantial amounts of tailpipe nox for all drive cycles tested. in a case study two modifications to the system hardware are introduced with counterintuitive results. first, the hcci regime is further constrained to conditions where engine-out nox levels are extremely low. second, the size of the osc is significantly reduced, allowing a much faster and less inefficient depletion. associated drive cycle results show a substantial reduction in tailpipe nox while fuel economy benefits can be maintained.

electricity	biogas has been earmarked as an efficient way to promote economic development and mitigate environmental emissions, and it requires a better accounting framework to evaluate its performance. in this study, we aim to develop an emergy-based accounting framework to assess and report the sustainability performance of biogas projects. first, the existing financial accounting and environmental accounting methodologies are combined to measure and report the economic events and environmental characteristics of a biogas project. then, using the new metric of emdollar value, the cost and revenue flows within the system boundary are unified and quantified by multiplying specific emergy transformity to reflect their embodiment and hierarchical characteristics. an integrated accounting framework covering economic aspects (economic profitability, economic efficiency, operation risk), environmental aspects (environmental resource utilization, load, emissions) and environmental-economic composited characteristics (emissions reduction efficiency, emdollar intensity of emission reduction, emission intensity of profit) is set up accordingly. results show that the biogas project has a positive net present value of 1.64e+04 emdollars. the total cost can be returned after 5 years. the renewability ratio, environmental load ratio (elr), and composite sustainability indicator (csi) reflecting environmental load are 9%, 10.1, and 0.76, respectively. the proposed sustainability accounting framework may unveil the real environmental support and assess the ecological economic performance of a biogas project.

electrical_circuits	a simple optoelectronic regenerator for differential quadrature phase-shift keying (qpsk) signals is demonstrated. the regenerator consists of two parallel delay interferometers followed by balanced detectors, limiting and driving amplifiers, and a dual-parallel mach-zehnder modulator that regenerates noise-suppressed optical qpsk signals. we experimentally show that the regenerator improves the receiver sensitivity by about 8 db at an input optical signal-to-noise ratio (osnr) of 19 db at a signal speed of 10 gbaud. numerical simulation is conducted for higher speed operation at 56 gbaud to study the impact of the bandwidth of electrical circuits inside the regenerator on the regenerator performance. electrical power consumption of the regenerator is assessed, and it is shown that the optoelectronic regenerator consumes a similar amount of electrical power as that consumed by an all-optical version of the regenerator using semiconductor optical amplifiers as a nonlinear element.
pid_controller	a systematic data-based design method for tuning proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controllers for disturbance attenuation is proposed. in this method, a set of closed-loop plant data are directly exploited without using a process model. pid controller parameters for a control system that behaves as closely as possible to the reference model for disturbance rejection are derived. two algorithms are developed to calculate the pid parameters. one algorithm determines the optimal time delay in the reference model by solving an optimization problem, whereas the other algorithm avoids the nonlinear optimization by using a simple approximation for the time delay term, enabling derivation of analytical pid tuning formulas. because plant data integrals are used in the regression equations for calculating pid parameters, the two proposed algorithms are robust against measurement noises. moreover, the controller tuning involves an adjustable design parameter that enables the user to achieve a trade-off between performance and robustness. because of its closed-loop tuning capability, the proposed method can be applied online to improve (retune) existing underperforming controllers for stable, integrating, and unstable plants. simulation examples covering a wide variety of process dynamics, including two examples related to reactor systems, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tuning method.

system_identification	l-band digital aeronautical communication system 1 (l-dacs1) is a promising candidate data-link for future air-ground communication, but it is severely interfered by the pulse pairs (pps) generated by distance measure equipment. a novel pp mitigation approach is proposed in this paper. firstly, a deformed pp detection (dppd) method that combines a filter bank, correlation detection, and rescanning is proposed to detect the deformed pps (dpps) which are caused by multiple filters in the receiver. secondly, a finite impulse response (fir) model is used to approximate the overall characteristic of filters, and then the waveform of dpp can be acquired by the original waveform of pp and the fir model. finally, sparse representation is used to estimate the position and amplitude of each dpp, and then reconstruct each dpp. the reconstructed dpps will be subtracted from the contaminated signal to mitigate interference. numerical experiments show that the bit error rate performance of our approach is about 5 db better than that of recent works and is closer to interference-free environment.

state_space_representation	nonlinearity can be used to enhance broadband rotating piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting, but how to construct a proper nonlinear rotating harvester is a challenging problem in engineering applications. this article presents a melnikov-theory-based method to explore broadband mechanism and necessary conditions of nonlinear rotating piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting system. first, a perturbed state-space representation of nonlinear rotating energy harvesting system is built based on its dynamic model. it can be seen that bi-stability of the unperturbed nonlinear system is the physical basis of achieving broadband and low-frequency rotating energy harvesting. second, the melnikov function is defined to derive two necessary conditions of homoclinic bifurcation and chaotic motions. then simulations are performed to identify the key parameters and their effects on the melnikov conditions, including distance, rotating frequency, and excitations. it can be seen that homoclinic bifurcation and chaotic motions can occur in nonlinear rotating energy harvesting systems under single-frequency and broadband excitations. finally, the experiments are carried out to validate the two necessary conditions. the results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide important guidelines for optimally designing nonlinear rotating piezoelectric energy harvesters in practice.
digital_control	the time delay caused by the calculation time is unavoidable for the implementation of digital controller and also degrades the control performance. in order to cope with the time delay for the control of single-phase uninterruptible power supply (ups), this paper proposes the time delay compensator based on the smith-predictor for both voltage and current controller and also evaluates the usefulness of the compensator by analytic analysis and experimental results. theoretically the compensator alleviates the effect of time delay for both voltage and current controller, but the compensation for the fast current control is usually sufficient from the practical point of view. the experimental results are presented to show the validity of the proposed design and analysis of the time delay compensator for single-phase ups.
electrical_circuits	in2s3 films have been grown on preheated glass substrate by spray pyrolysis. indium chloride and thiourea in the molar ratio s:in = 2 were used as reagents. substrate temperature was fixed at 613 k. these films adhered well to the substrate and were approximately 2 mu m thick. structural, morphological, optical, and electrical properties of the as-grown in2s3 films were studied by use of x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (afm), optical absorption spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. xrd revealed well crystallized films oriented in the (400) direction corresponding to the cubic beta-in2s3 phase. the surface of the films was smooth; average roughness was 5 nm. the afm image revealed that the films were nanopolycrystalline and contained grains in the range 20-30 nm. optical transmission in the visible and near-infrared regions was 80%. the direct band-gap energy was 2.62 ev. the electrical data were analyzed on the basis of the impedance cole-cole plots in the frequency range 0.1 hz to 100 khz at room temperature. constant-phase elements were used in equivalent electrical circuits for fitting of experimental impedance data. the experimental results were fitted to the equivalent electrical circuit by use of z-view software. the conductivity of grains and grain boundaries was estimated. the gas-sensing properties of the sample were investigated on the basis of the change in conductance as a result of adsorption and desorption of atmospheric oxygen.

analog_signal_processing	in developing country like bangladesh, the demand of electrical energy is very higher than the available production. at present, the electricity supply deficiency is about 1500 to 2000 mw /day i.e. the total supply is 4000 to 4500 mw/day within the demand of 6000mw/day for this reason power failure has become an acute problem in our country. to solve this energy crisis, it is important to found alternative approaches. recently tidal power becomes most important and researchable topic in the world, especially the countries which are placed near sea or ocean. bangladesh is situated between 20 degrees 34' and 26 degrees 38' north latitude, 88 degrees 01' & 92 degrees 41' east longitude with an area of 147570 sq.km. it has a 710 km of coastal line along the bay of bengal [1-3]. as bangladesh has a long coastal line along the bay of bengal, so tidal energy technology can be used as one of the major reliable energy resource. in this paper an efficient tidal energy site is proposed based on analysis of technical as well as market data and the data is collected from bangladesh navy and different tidal current data chart. finally based on tidal current condition of one of the efficient site, a matlab simulink simulation result is shown by proposed a suitable electrical generator.
analog_signal_processing	the paper presents an original approach of designing analog signal processing circuits, based on the re-using of the same functional core for implementing two circuit functions: signal gain with theoretical null distortions and signal squaring. the advantages of the increased modularity and controllability and of the reduced design costs represent an immediate consequence of the double function realized by the proposed structures. because the most important circuit complexity is concentrated for implementing the core of the structure, both circuit area and power consumption per each realized function can be strongly reduced using this method. the overall error of the transconductance amplifier is 0.4% and the approximation error for the squaring circuit is 0.27%, in the condition of a low-voltage low-power operation (a supply voltage of 1.5v and a medium current consumption of 50 mu a for each implemented circuit function).
state_space_representation	this paper presents a dynamic model of a once-through-to-superheat solar steam receiver for electricity generation. the receiver is a mono-tube cavity boiler mounted at the focal point of a 500 m(2) paraboloidal dish concentrator at the australian national university. the dynamic model is derived from physical principles of mass and energy conservation, and uses a moving boundary formulation, coupled with a switching approach, to represent outlet flow, ranging from sub-cooled liquid to superheated steam. a method to compute outlet mass flow rate for all three receiver outlet flow conditions is included. this modelling approach results in a compact state-space representation of the receiver which is useful in the development of model-based control strategies for the operation of the receiver in a concentrator plant. the model is implemented in trnsys 16 and validated with experimental data from the australian national university 500 m(2) dish system.

operational_amplifier	this paper presents a digital testing strategy for characterizing an analog circuit block. the operational amplifier (op amp) is evaluated due to its wide application in electronic circuits and systems. in the proposed strategy, the op amp device under test (dut) is configured to respond to a testing pulse, and the associated output is digitized by a digital buffer to reduce the high cost of generating a high-frequency clock. the testing procedure is divided into two modes to estimate the reference slew rate and then to evaluate the practical slew rate to moderate the difficulty of designing a digital buffer that has a highly precise delay time. the testing concept, accuracy, time, and hardware are also comprehensively investigated to describe the proposed testing strategy. the digital compatibility, the simplicity, and the testing capability of the high-performance op amp are the main advantages of the proposed testing strategy. easily available discrete devices were experimentally employed to verify the functionality of the proposed testing strategy. an integrated application to test the op amp dut embedded in a second-order sallen-key low-pass filter was simulated with the hspice tool to verify the testing feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
pid_controller	the effect of spatial variations in mean radiant temperature and occupancy on hvac energy and occupant thermal comfort is studied in an operi-plan office space with multiple ahus. a predictive control method is proposed that arrives at optimum temperature set-point vector by solving an optimization problem, which minimizes hvac energy consumption subject to acceptable thermal comfort and adequate outside air intake. the optimum temperature set-point vector is used in a pid controller that modulates the ahu fan speed. the proposed control is evaluated on occupancy traces observed in an open-plan space and compared with static set-points based pid control strategies. normally pid control operates with a dead band around the static set-point and the ahu fan speed is adjusted only when return air temperature is outside the dead-band. the proposed control has a dynamic set-point and hence the ahu speeds are adjusted at much finer time steps than the normal control. the occupancy traces are classified into densely and sparsely occupied days. across all days, the proposed control achieves an average additional savings of 15% over a pid control that assumes uniform spatial occupancy distribution in ahu control and 12% over a pid based strategy that uses actual spatial occupancy information.

pid_controller	different educational and didactic papers that allow students to experimentally validate linear controllers have been reported. however, generally, in those papers, procedure followed to select controller gains is not discussed. this lack of information renders difficult experimental implementation of controllers by students who, in general, do not have enough experience on controller tuning. motivated by this situation, this paper introduces a methodology that provides important information on how to select controller gains for regulation in a furuta pendulum. this methodology allows improving closed-loop system performance in a desired direction. differential flatness is the furuta pendulum property that is exploited. the main idea is to translate a linear state feedback control design problem into a scenario, where classical tools such as root locus can be used. as an example, controller design is directed toward reduction or even elimination of limit cycle effects. the proposal is experimentally tested on a built furuta pendulum. these experimental results show that the closed-loop system performance is improved, and hence, the proposed methodology is successfully validated.
state_space_representation	this contribution addresses the development of a linear quadratic (lq) regulator in order to control the concentration profiles along a catalytic distillation column, which is modelled by a set of coupled hyperbolic partial differential and algebraic equations (pdaes). the proposed method is based on an infinite-dimensional state-space representation of the pdae system which is generated by a transport operator. the presence of the algebraic equations, makes the velocity matrix in the transport operator, spatially varying, non-diagonal, and not necessarily negative through of the domain. the optimal control problem is treated using operator riccati equation (ore) approach. the existence and uniqueness of the non-negative solution to the ore are shown and the ore is converted into a matrix riccati differential equation which allows the use of a numerical scheme to solve the control problem. the result is then extended to design an optimal proportional plus integral controller which can reject the effect of load losses. the performance of the designed control policy is assessed through a numerical study.

electrical_network	a new directional solidification technique has been presented. this technique employs the pyrolytic graphite for heat dissipation by conduction and does not withdraw the cast. the furnace design was presented for this static solid cooling (ssc) method. a heat dissipation model was put forward for evaluating the cooling efficiency by calculating the total thermal resistance in directional solidification. the total thermal resistance in the ssc method is the minimum compared with other methods. the solidification process is simulated and the results show that the axial temperature gradient increases to 130 degrees c/cm from 52 degrees c/cm (bridgman method) and the growth rate is improved to 10.84 mm/min from 3.86 mm/min (bridgman method). the solidification time is reduced by 64.4%. the cooling rate increases dramatically as well. additionally, the heat insulation of the hot and cool zones is improved substantially in the ssc method. the thermal resistance of the mould is reduced as well due to the thin mould. besides, the ssc method employs the electrical network to control the growth rate. the solidification condition is much uniform due to the position control by the electrical network.

digital_control	an approach to mass measurement for the electronic balance based on continuous-time sigma-delta (ct sigma-delta) modulator is described in this paper. as an effect of multifarious interfering noises, the accuracy of the electronic balance is restricted. the general idea of this proposed approach is to apply an electromagnetic-force-compensated load cell (emcc), a related signal processing circuit, and a composite filter. the circuit mainly consists of a proportional-integral-differential controller and a pulsewidth modulator, which combine with the emcc to form a ct sigma-delta modulator. as the ct sigma-delta modulator possesses inherent antialiasing filtering, oversampling, and noise-shaping characteristics, the interfering noises can be effectively removed by the composite filter that is composed of two sinc(n) filters. the simulations for both of the electronic balance models adopting the proposed approach and working in conventional pulse current mode are analyzed by adding the white gaussian noise in simulink. the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach, the proposed electronic balance in the field can improve its signal-to-noise ratio, and the testing results meet the requirement for the weighing accuracy of the special-class scale defined by organisation internationale de metrologie legale r76 nonautomatic weighing instruments.
electricity	we propose a two-stage mixed-integer linear stochastic optimization model to analyze the scheduling of electricity-production units under natural gas-supply uncertainty due to pipeline congestion and natural gas-price variability. the first stage of this stochastic optimization model represents the day-ahead scheduling (i.e., unit commitment) stage, while the second stage represents actual real-time operations through a number of scenarios. we use this model to analyze the effect on unit commitment and dispatch of two types of natural gas-supply conditions. first, we analyze a case involving low-cost natural gas supply with natural gas-transmission issues related to potential gas-pipeline congestion. we then examine a case involving higher-cost natural gas, which is used solely to attain feasibility with fast-ramping events. the first case mimics situations in the iso new england system, in which relatively low-cost natural gas supply is uncertain in cold-weather conditions due to natural gas-transmission bottlenecks. the second case is reminiscent of situations in the california iso system, in which relatively expensive but flexible natural gas-fired units need to be used to handle rapid changes in net demand in the early mornings and late afternoons.
digital_control	this paper presents a nonlinear power system stabilizer based on a pointwise min-norm control law and a third order state space mathematical model of the synchronous generator connected through transmission lines to the power system. commonly, the mathematical model includes transient electromotive force as a state variable that cannot be measured. therefore, the mathematical model is transformed in a form containing all measurable variables. furthermore, the control law for the proposed stabilizer also considers voltage regulation. the proposed algorithm has been implemented in a digital control system and its performance experimentally verified on a 83 kva synchronous generator connected to the power system. experimental results referring to the change in voltage and mechanical power reference, for disconnection of the transmission line, three phase and two phase short circuit, and forced oscillations are presented and compared to a pss2a stabilizer. the experimental results show better performance of the excitation system with the proposed stabilizer compared to the system with a conventional pi voltage controller and pss2a stabilizer. furthermore, the results show that the proposed stabilizer is robust to system changes in the case of small and large disturbances, as well as near the generator stability limit.

system_identification	this paper proposes a cascaded control structure and a method of practical application for attitude control of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (uav). the cascade control, which has tighter control capability than a single-loop control, is rarely used in attitude control of a multi-rotor uav due to the input-output relation, which is no longer simply a set-point to euler angle response transfer function of a single-loop pid control, but there are multiply measured signals and interactive control loops that increase the complexity of evaluation in conventional way of design. however, it is proposed in this research a method that can optimize a cascade control with a primary and secondary loops and a pid controller for each loop. an investigation of currently available pid-tuning methods lead to selection of the simple internal model control (simc) method, which is based on the internal model control (imc) and direct-synthesis method. through the analysis and experiments, this research proposes a systematic procedure to implement a cascaded attitude controller, which includes the flight test, system identification and simc-based pid-tuning. the proposed method was validated successfully from multiple applications where the application to roll axis lead to a pid-pid cascade control, but the application to yaw axis lead to that of pid-pi.
pid_controller	for a flexible manipulator system, the unwanted vibrations deteriorate usually the performance of the system due to the coupling of large overall motion and elastic vibration. this paper focuses on the active vibration control of a two-link flexible manipulator with piezoelectric materials. the multi flexible body dynamics (mfbd) model of the two-link flexible manipulator attached with piezoelectric sensors and actuators is established firstly. based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ancf), the motion equations of the manipulator system are derived and motion process and dynamic responses of the system are simulated. according to the time varying feature of system, a fuzzy pid controller is developed to depress the vibration. this controller can tune control gains online accommodating to the variation of the system. control results obtained by the fuzzy pid control and the conventional pid control indicate that the fuzzy pid controller can effectively suppress the elastic vibration of the manipulator system and performs better than the conventional pid controller.
electricity	when talking about energy conservation, ""rebound effect"" (re) is always concerned, which defined as the increasing energy consumption relative to the counterfactual predicted by technological progress because of efficiency induced decrease in the real price of energy services. in this paper, we try to find a way to figure out the re through calculating the substitution relations accord with the definition. based on the trans-log cost function and considering the asymmetric impact on energy-cost share equation, the paper applies allen-uzawa substitution elasticity to establish the price-oriented analysis diagram of fossil-energy consumption re. 'using time series data, applying the joint method of the dynamic ols (dols) and the seemingly unrelated regressions (sur), the re in china 's electricity generation sector is estimated. the results showed that the re is 11.6% in china 's electricity generation sector if allowing for asymmetric price effects, which indicates that china 's power generation sector generally displays a feature of energy saving.

electricity	the paper aims to determine the day-ahead market bidding strategies for retailers with flexible demands to maximize the short-term profit. it proposes a short-term planning framework to forecast the load under dynamic tariffs and construct biding curves. stochastic programming is applied to manage the uncertainties of spot price, regulating price, consumption behaviors, and responsiveness to dynamic tariffs. a case study based on data from sweden is carried out. it demonstrates that a real-time selling price can affect the aggregate load of a residential consumer group and lead to load shift toward low-price periods. the optimal bidding curves for specific trading periods are illustrated. through comparing the bidding strategies under different risk factors, the case study shows that a risk-averse retailer tends to adopt the strategies with larger imbalances. the benefit lies in the reduction of low-profit risk. however, the aversion to risk can only be kept in a certain level. a larger imbalance may lead to a quick reduction of profit in all scenarios.
analog_signal_processing	this paper reports a suspended coil, electromagnetic acoustic energy harvester (aeh) for extracting acoustical energy. the developed aeh comprises helmholtz resonator (hr), a wound coil bonded to a flexible membrane and a permanent magnet placed in a magnet holder. the harvester 's performance is analyzed under different sound pressure levels (spls) both in laboratory and in real environment. in laboratory, when connected to 50 omega load resistance and subjected to an spl of 100 db, the aeh generated a peak load voltage of 198.7 mv at the resonant frequency of 319 hz. when working under the optimum load resistance, the aeh generated an optimum load power of 789.65 mu w. in real environment, the developed aeh produced a maximum voltage of 25 mv when exposed to the acoustic noise of a motorcycle and generated an optimum voltage of 60 mv when it is placed in the surroundings of a domestic electrical generator.
operational_amplifier	radiation hardness of different samples of the same ics can vary greatly from lot to lot, depending on the year or the country of production. however, it is assumed that radiation hardness of the samples from the same lot is the same too. the new chip uniformity test method based on ionization response comparison is offered.
electric_motor	swimming exercise at optimal speed may optimize growth performance of yellowtail kingfish in a recirculating aquaculture system. therefore, optimal swimming speeds (u-opt in m s(-1) or body lengths s(-1), bl s(-1)) were assessed and then applied to determine the effects of long-term forced and sustained swimming at u-opt on growth performance of juvenile yellowtail kingfish. uopt was quantified in blazka-type swim-tunnels for 145, 206, and 311 mm juveniles resulting in values of: (1) 0.70 m s(-1) or 4.83 bl s(-1), (2) 0.82 m s(-1) or 3.25 bl s(-1), and (3) 0.85 m s(-1) or 2.73 bl s(-1). combined with literature data from larger fish, a relation of u-opt (bl s(-1)) = 234.07(bl)(-0.779) (r-2 = 0.9909) was established for this species. yellowtail kingfish, either forced to perform sustained swimming exercise at an optimal speed of 2.46 bl s(-1) (""swimmers"") or allowed to perform spontaneous activity at low water flow (""resters"") in a newly designed 3600 l oval flume (with flow created by an impeller driven by an electric motor), were then compared. at the start of the experiment, ten fish were sampled representing the initial condition. after 18 days, swimmers (n = 23) showed a 92% greater increase in bl and 46% greater increase in bvv as compared to resters (n = 23). as both groups were fed equal rations, feed conversion ratio (fcr) for swimmers was 1.21 vs. 1.74 for resters. doppler ultrasound imaging showed a statistically significant higher blood flow (31%) in the ventral aorta of swimmers vs. resters (44 +/- 3 vs. 34 +/- 3 ml min(-1), respectively, under anesthesia). thus, growth performance can be rapidly improved by optimal swimming, without larger feed investments.
signal-flow_graph	this paper presents new cmos current-mode ladder chebyshev and elliptic band-pass filters (bpfs). the signal flow graph and the network transformation methods are used to synthesize the proposed bpfs by using chebyshev and elliptic rlc low-pass prototypes. cmos-based lossy and lossless integrators with grounded capacitors are used to synthesize the proposed bpfs. the proposed filters can be electronically tuned between 10 khz and 100 mhz by adjusting the bias current from 0.02 mu a to 200 mu a. both filters use a 1.5 v dc power supply, which leads to low dynamic power consumption. both filters enjoy total harmonic distortion of less than 1.5% along the range of the tuning bias currents. simulation results are included to illustrate the functionality of the proposed filters.
pid_controller	the grey wolf optimization algorithm is proposed to design proportional, integrative and derivative controllers using a two degrees of freedom control configuration. the control system is designed in order to achieve good set-point tracking and disturbance rejection performance. the design is accomplished by minimizing an aggregated cost function based on the time-weighted absolute error integral, subjected to robustness constraints. the control system robustness levels are prescribed in terms of the vector margin and maximum complementary sensitivity function values. simulation results are presented for several common systems dynamics and compared with the ones obtained with a particle swarm optimization algorithm.
operational_amplifier	this paper proposes a novel analog circuit verification approach using causal reasoning. to verify analog circuits, the flow begins with mining the causal reasoning steps (design plan) that produced the circuit, including starting ideas, design step sequence, and their justification [1]. then, topological structures corresponding to the starting ideas and design step sequences are verified individually by replacing the related devices with ideal amplifier model. circuit performance is evaluated through spectre simulation. comparing simulation results reveals incorrect functional issues and/or performance drawbacks (negative causes) of certain starting ideas or design steps, which might have been omitted during the design process. the paper discusses three operational amplifier designs realized in 0.2-mu m cmos technology to illustrate the verification approach.
system_identification	the electromagnetic actuators are widely used in the industry due to their simple structure, force characteristics, and low manufacturing costs. however, from control point of view, they are nonlinear systems. in this brief, clustering-based system identification experiments as well as a piecewise mathematical model are described. furthermore, a model-based fault detection and isolation of the actuator is presented, when the armature movement is sensed indirectly, by sensing only the armature current.
signal-flow_graph	we derive a unified graph-theoretic approach to continuous and discrete phase-type distributions. the algorithms are given to obtain the signal-flow graph directly from either the matrix representation of the distribution or from the transition diagram of the underlying markov chain. the transfer function of the signal-flow graph, easily computable using mason 's rule, gives the characteristic function of the phase-type distribution in a symbolic form. the proposed approach intrinsically includes non-trivial initial probabilities of the states. moreover, in the continuous case, it results in graphs that are simpler to obtain than those found in the literature. finally, we show that the approximate discrete counterpart of the continuous phase-type distribution can be viewed as the forward difference (euler) mapping between continuous and discrete time domains.

electrical_network	in order to take full advantage of distributed generators, an evolution of the classical power system organization and management is also necessary. an aggregator of a residential urban electrical network can be considered by the distribution system operator as a stakeholder, which is able to control a cluster of local generators and loads with technical constraints for the connection with the remaining distribution grid and commercial contracts with outer electrical producers. this paper is focused on the design of the microgrid central energy management system which relies on a day-ahead operational planning and an online adjustment procedure during the operation. a dynamic programming-based algorithm is derived to solve the unit commitment problem with a multiobjective function in order to reduce the economic cost and co2 equivalent emissions. the proposed energy management system is implemented into a supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) and tested by using a hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the urban network. economic and environmental gains are evaluated.
signal-flow_graph	we describe a complete, fast implementation to compute a 2d discrete cosine transform. we briefly discuss the hardware model for which we are developing a toolkit. we employ an 11 x 8 array of common processors handling data at the level of words with automatic data flow synchronization. we present a general software solution as opposed to a custom-built hardware description. the solution is a unique composition of two, algorithms, yielding a systolic (highly parallel with regular data flow) implementation. it is efficient as utilization of resources is high. although the solution is computationally intensive, it is suitable for real-time applications as the input data, which is an infinite sequence of 8 x 8 matrices, is input one row at a time continuously. finally, we discuss programming tools which are needed to ease the programming effort. we hope this work demonstrates the importance of such tools.
digital_control	a grid-connected inverter is indispensable for photovoltaic power generation and smart grid systems, and it must be designed for stable operation. the impedance method based on the nyquist criterion is often utilized to analyze the stability of grid-connected inverter systems. the impedance method is based on the eigenvalues of the product of the inverter output admittance and the line impedance matrices in the frequency domain. however, the frequency characteristics have so far been derived only for inverters with analog control systems. a new frequency analysis method for inverters with digital control systems is proposed in this paper. first, a stability analysis example for a three-phase lcl-type inverter controlled digitally is shown and the results are compared and validated with those by simulation using a saber simulator. finally, they are also compared and validated with experimental results digitally controlled by a dsp-based system.

control_engineering	soil degradation is one of the most serious ecological problems in the world. in arid and semi-arid northern china, soil degradation predominantly arises from wind erosion. trends in soil degradation caused by wind erosion in northern china frequently change with human activities and climatic change. to decrease soil loss by wind erosion and enhance local ecosystems, the chinese government has been encouraging residents to reduce wind-induced soil degradation through a series of national policies and several ecological projects, such as the natural forest protection program, the national action program to combat desertification, the ""three norths"" shelter forest system, the beijing-tianjin sand source control engineering project, and the grain for green project. all these were implemented a number of decades ago, and have thus created many land management practices and control techniques across different landscapes. these measures include conservation tillage, windbreak networks, checkerboard barriers, the non-watering and tube-protecting planting technique, afforestation, grassland enclosures, etc. as a result, the aeolian degradation of land has been controlled in many regions of arid and semiarid northern china. however, the challenge of mitigating and further reversing soil degradation caused by wind erosion still remains.

electricity	more than two decades have passed since the start of the worldwide market-oriented electricity sector reforms. the reforms have varied in terms of structure, market mechanisms, and regulation. however, the passage of time calls for taking stock of the performance of the reforms in developing countries. this paper surveys the empirical literature on electricity sector reforms and draws some conclusions with a view to the future. overall, the reforms have tended to improve the technical efficiency of the sector. the macroeconomic benefits of reforms are less clear and remain difficult to identify. also, the gains from the reforms have often not trickled down to consumers because of institutional and regulatory weaknesses. in order to achieve lasting benefits, reforms need to adopt measures that align their pursuit of economic efficiency with those of equity and provision of access. reforms can deliver more economic benefits and alleviate poverty when the poor have access to electricity. new technologies and institutional capacity building can help improve the performance of reforms.
system_identification	this study presents a class of fractional order models for system identification of thermal dynamics of buildings. fractional order dynamics has been found to be inherent in the nature of heat transfer problems. it is thus instinctive to use fractional order models to describe the overall thermal dynamics of a building. besides, fractional time series modeling is known by its long memory effect and capability of representing high-order complicated models in lower-order and compact forms. the reduction of model parameters can then relieve the computational overhead in the system identification procedure. this is of particular significance in model-based predictive control for building energy efficiency. in particular, a fractional order autoregressive model with exogenous input (farx) is formulated and a corresponding parameter estimation using least squares technique is also provided. furthermore, the farx model is validated using simulation data from a detailed model built via iessoftware and compared with the prediction using traditional arx model. it is found that the farx model can reduce the computational time largely while retaining the prediction accuracy.

control_engineering	multilevel inverters generate high-level voltage with high quality and low-harmonic distortion, and these unique properties have increased their applications in renewable energy sources. however, these inverters require several passive components and a complex pulse width modulation (pwm) control method. besides, they suffer from voltage balancing problems. in this work, a new inverter has proposed that generates seven-level voltage from one dc source by reduced number of switches which does not exhibit any voltage balancing problem. the proposed inverter without any extra boost circuit is able to increase the input voltage. the voltage stress on all the switches in the proposed inverter is the same. in this study, variable amplitude phase disposition pwm control method that is compatible with the proposed inverter is developed. moreover, extended structure of the proposed inverter and its new algorithm in generating all odd and even voltage levels are proposed. to validate the performance of the inverter, a prototype has been built and tested and also its performance has been modelled using pscad/emtdc software package. very good agreement has been achieved between experimental results and simulations.
electric_motor	the importance of fault diagnoses, in any kind of machinery, ca n't be over stated. any undetected small fault in machinery will most probably rise with time and will cause machinery to shut down thus resulting in both mechanical and more importantly economical loss for the industry. in recent years, researches have been done for the faults diagnosis through the analysis of their vibration and sound signatures. the extraction of those characteristic signatures is a complicated process because complexities in modern day machineries can results in many vibration and sound generating sources. this paper presents a condition based fault diagnoses technique to detect the condition of gear. an experimental setup, consisting of a worm gear driven by an electric motor, was setup to conduct tests under different working conditions. the vibration and sound signature signals of worm gear were examined for normal and faulty conditions under different speeds and oil levels. the collected data was then used for feature extraction, by using fast fourier transform to filter background noise signals and to collect only the signature of the gearbox vibration and sound signals. an mlp (multilayer perceptron) artificial neural network model has been developed to classify the signature signals. a thermal camera is also used to observe the heating patterns for all those working conditions. with the help of mlp artificial neural network it is possible to predict the speed and oil level of the gearbox and hence a possible fault diagnoses is also feasible.

system_identification	most studies tackling hysteresis identification in the technical literature follow white-box approaches, i.e. they rely on the assumption that measured data obey a specific hysteretic model. such an assumption may be a hard requirement to handle in real applications, since hysteresis is a highly individualistic nonlinear behaviour. the present paper adopts a black-box approach based on nonlinear state-space models to identify hysteresis dynamics. this approach is shown to provide a general framework to hysteresis identification, featuring flexibility and parsimony of representation. nonlinear model terms are constructed as a multivariate polynomial in the state variables, and parameter estimation is performed by minimising weighted least-squares cost functions. technical issues, including the selection of the model order and the polynomial degree, are discussed, and model validation is achieved in both broadband and sine conditions. the study is carried out numerically by exploiting synthetic data generated via the bouc-wen equations.

system_identification	signal detection in the presence of high noise is a challenge in natural sciences. from understanding signals emanating out of deep space probes to signals in protein interactions for systems biology, domain specific innovations are needed. the present work is in the domain of transfer alignment (ta), which deals with estimation of the misalignment of deliverable daughter munitions with respect to that of the delivering mother platform. in this domain, the design of noise filtering scheme has to consider a time varying and nonlinear system dynamics at play. the accuracy of conventional particle filter formulation suffers due to deviations from modeled system dynamics. an evolutionary particle filter can overcome this problem by evolving multiple system models through few support points per particle. however, this variant has even higher time complexity for real-time execution. as a result, measurement update gets deferred and the estimation accuracy is compromised. by running these filter algorithms on multiple processors, the execution time can be reduced, to allow frequent measurement updates. such scheme ensures better system identification so that performance improves in case of simultaneous ejection of multiple daughters and also results in better convergence of ta algorithms for single daughter.
state_space_representation	wastewater treatment processes with activated sludge are described in the specialized literature by complex models with nonlinear parameterization, such as for example activated sludge model asm1, asm2 or asm3. under these conditions, the design of control structures using the state space representation is very difficult. suitable techniques to approach the control of these processes are using control structures based on an input-output model or using control structures obtained without even knowing the process model. in this paper two techniques of this type are analyzed: a data driven technique, virtual reference feedback tuning (vrft), and a robust control technique, quantitative feedback theory (qft). the control structures designed by the two methods are implemented using a wastewater treatment plant implemented in the simulation software simba for which a complex influent was considered. the influent includes information on water temperature and gives data for a period of one year. the analysis of the two methods considers the quality of the obtained control results but, at the same time, the difficulty of implementing the two methods.
digital_control	in this paper, a current sensorless adaptive secondary-side control is proposed for the series resonant converter (src), making it a good candidate for mhz 48 voltage regulators. by means of varying ac equivalent resistance, the output voltage regulation is achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the synchronous mosfet. by taking advantage of the secondary-side control, srcs can operate under zero-voltage switching at any input voltage and load conditions. a current sensorless adaptive digital control is proposed to control the current-type synchronous mosfets, which automatically compensates the delay caused by the current-sensor circuit and the gate driver, and also eliminates the current sensor in the power path. a hybrid control strategy is introduced to overcome the efficiency degradation caused by the secondary-side control.

system_identification	real-time structural parameter identification and damage detection are of great significance for structural health monitoring systems. the extended kalman filter has been implemented in many structural damage detection methods due to its capability to estimate structural parameters based on online measurement data. current research assumes constant structural parameters and uses static statistical process control for damage detection. however, structural parameters are typically slow-changing due to variations such as environmental and operational effects. hence, false alarms may easily be triggered when the data points falling outside of the static statistical process control range due to the environmental and operational effects. in order to overcome this problem, this article presents a novel real-time structural damage detection method by integrating extended kalman filter and dynamic statistical process control. based on historical measurements of damage-sensitive parameters in the state-space model, extended kalman filter is used to provide real-time estimations of these parameters as well as standard derivations in each time step, which are then used to update the control limits for dynamic statistical process control to detect any abnormality in the selected parameters. the numerical validation is performed on both linear and nonlinear structures, considering different damage scenarios. the simulation results demonstrate high detection accuracy rate and light computational costs of the developed extended kalman filter-dynamic statistical process control damage detection method and the potential for implementation in structural health monitoring systems for in-service civil structures.

state_space_representation	the main contribution of the paper is the modeling approach used to describe a pure three-phase shunt active filter, and the application of the h infinity control design tool in order to improve the quality of electrical energy. advanced power electronics devices have widely contributed to the degradation of power quality due to the injection of non-sinusoidal currents into the utility system. therefore, it is essential to use an active compensator which can attenuate current harmonics to an acceptable level on the line side of the power source. in this work, a three-phase active filter connected in parallel to a supply system feeding a non-linear load is described, in a complex framework, by a linear multivariable state space representation in order to guarantee that the system is mathematically decoupled and therefore to simplify the controller design. this representation includes a sensor to measure perturbations, and allows one to calculate a linear robust control law. the originality of this paper is that a linear matrix inequality based h infinity synthesis is performed to design a static state feedback controller with complex-valued parameters. the robustness of this controller with respect to network impedance uncertainties is investigated. moreover, simulation and experimental results are given to reveal the effectiveness of the synthesized control law.

analog_signal_processing	all-pass networks with prescribed group delay are used for analog signal processing and equalization of transmission channels. the state-of-the-art methods for synthesizing quasi-arbitrary group delay functions using all-pass elements lack a theoretical synthesis procedure that guarantees minimum-order networks. we present an analytically-based solution to this problem that produces an all-pass network with a response approximating the required group delay to within an arbitrary minimax error. for the first time, this method is shown to work for any physical realization of second-order all-pass elements, is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum solution without any choice of seed values as an input, and allows synthesis of pre-defined networks described both analytically and numerically. the proposed method is also demonstrated by reducing the delay variation of a practical system by any desired amount, and compared to state-of-the-art methods in comparison examples.

electricity	with the advancement in technologies, the power requirement around the globe is tremendously increasing, putting extra loads on grids. the existing grids cannot bear that load and also do not provide the interface with distributed renewable energy sources (dres). building new lines and substations alone do not serve the purpose of overcoming energy shortfall. thus a major transformation in electricity infrastructure is need of the hour to meet the ever growing demands of electricity. converting current power management system to a smart autonomic system is pertinent to achieve an increasing amount of renewable energy generation. this paper presents a comprehensive review of advances in control of smart grids. various robust and adaptive strategies are spotlighted with a detailed description of control of overloads and power smart grids. also, power generation, storage and management techniques and development of operational schedule of sources and loads are elaborated. recently reported systems and information and communication technologies (ict) techniques in smart grid are highlighted. renewable energy has potential to eliminate the current electricity crisis in pakistan 's energy sector. the solar, wind, hydro and biogas/biomass are the alternative energy resources found abundantly in the country, which have tremendous potential to offer environment-friendly energy solutions. this in-depth study reveals that a lot of opportunities and potential of smart grid technology exist in developing countries like pakistan that need to be exploited so as to cope with energy crisis.
pid_controller	this paper presents the modeling and control of a hybrid wind-tidal turbine with hydraulic accumulator. the hybrid turbine captures the offshore wind energy and tidal current energy simultaneously and stores the excess energy in hydraulic accumulator prior to electricity generation. two hydraulic pumps installed respectively in wind and tidal turbine nacelles are used to transform the captured mechanical energy into hydraulic energy. to extract the maximal power from wind and tidal current, standard torque controls are achieved by regulating the displacements of the hydraulic pumps. to meet the output power demand, a proportion integration differentiation (pid) controller is designed to distribute the hydraulic energy between the accumulator and the pelton turbine. a simulation case study based on combining a 5 mw offshore wind turbine and a 1 mw tidal current turbine is undertaken. case study demonstrates that the hybrid generation system not only captures all the available wind and tidal energy and also delivers the desired generator power precisely through the accumulator damping out all the power fluctuations from the wind and tidal speed disturbances. energy and exergy analyses show that the energy efficiency can exceed 100% as the small input speeds are considered, and the exergy efficiency has the consistent change trends with demand power. further more parametric sensitivity study on hydraulic accumulator shows that there is an inversely proportional relationship between accumulator and hydraulic equipments including the pump and nozzle in terms of dimensions.

electricity	vibration exists everywhere especially in the public railway operation system. the vibration acceleration is the key factor to monitor and evaluate the structure health of the railway equipment. in this paper, a kind of self-powered triboelectric nano vibration accelerometer (teva) is presented. a low frequency spring mass vibration model is built to calculate the vibration sensitive performance and the electric output of the teva. the prototype of the teva is demonstrated and characterized through the railway vibration simulation platform. it has been testified that teva can successfully harvest the low frequency vibration energy and convert it to electrical power to achieve the self-powered vibration acceleration monitoring system. the output current and voltage of teva are also sensitive to the vibration acceleration from 1.07 m/s(2) to 1.25 m/s(2) linearly. hence it can be used as a self-powered nano vibration accelerator for the fault diagnosis. in addition, the generated electricity is used for charging the lithium battery (from 1.5v to 3.1 v) which supplies power to the zigbee module. the experiment shows that the charged battery through teva can support the wireless communication between zigbee modules, with temperature and humidity sensors embedded on it. the temperature and humidity on the train are 22 degrees c and 35% rh respectively. therefore, the vibration energy can be harvested and stored for the power supply of wireless sensor network nodes in the near future.
control_engineering	nowadays. tuition of control engineering in the courses, which are usually obligatory for all students attending technical universities, is unimaginable without passing a practical part in laboratories. set-ups in such laboratories have undergone its evolution. instead of demos of real industrial control solutions on small-scale laboratory models, increasing interest is paid to the tasks presenting control problems on attractive models invoking natural interest for heuristic mastering them. these specially designed model devices are linked with pcs in order to provide realistic hmi and, then, of course, with internet. the aim of the paper is a short presentation of these set-ups by their names characterizing the demonstrated activity. in addition we wish to present our experience from the application of various technologies used in creating virtual version of these tasks. the virtual versions try to be true computer copies of the real models. this makes possible a preliminary preparation of the students for the given task and after that a certain confrontation of the results with those obtained in reality carrying out similar out similar experiment on the place in the laboratory or through remote access via internet.

pid_controller	this paper presents the design of capacitive wireless power transfer systems based on a class-e inverter approach. the main reason for adopting the class-e inverter approach is because of its high efficiency, theoretically 100%. however, the operation of a class-e inverter is highly sensitive to its circuit 's parameters. in a typical capacitive wireless power transfer application, the capacitive coupling distance between plates is subject to changes, and hence its power transfer efficiency is greatly affected if the class-e inverter is properly tuned. this drawback motivates us to develop an auto frequency tuning algorithm for a class-e inverter which maintains its power transfer efficiency in spite of the variations of capacitive coupling distances between plates and circuit 's parameters. finally, simulation and experiment are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the auto frequency tuning algorithm.
electrical_network	given an undirected graph, the resistance distance between two nodes is the resistance one would measure between these two nodes in an electrical network if edges were resistors. summing these distances over all pairs of nodes yields the so-called kirchhoff index of the graph, which measures its overall connectivity. in this work, we consider erdos-renyi random graphs. since the graphs are random, their kirchhoff indices are random variables. we give formulas for the expected value of the kirchhoff index and show it concentrates around its expectation. we achieve this by studying the trace of the pseudoinverse of the laplacian of erdos-renyi graphs. for synchronization (a class of estimation problems on graphs) our results imply that acquiring pairwise measurements uniformly at random is a good strategy, even if only a vanishing proportion of the measurements can be acquired.

system_identification	operational modal analysis is the primary tool for modal parameter identification in civil engineering. bayesian statistics offers an ideal framework for analyzing uncertainties associated with the identified modal parameters. however, the exact bayesian formulation is usually intractable due to the high computational demand in obtaining the posterior distributions of modal parameters. in this paper, the variational bayes method is employed to provide an approximate solution. unlike the laplace approximation and monte carlo sampling, the variational bayes approach provides a gradient-free algorithm to analytically approximate the posterior distributions. working with the state-space representation of a dynamical system, the variational bayes approach for identification of modal parameters is derived by ignoring statistical correlation between latent variables and the model parameters. in this approach, the joint distribution of the state-transition and observation matrices as well as the joint distribution of the process noise and measurement error are firstly calculated analytically using conjugate priors. the distribution of modal parameters is extracted from these obtained joint distributions using a first-order taylor series expansion. a robust implementation of the method is discussed by using square-root filtering and cholesky decomposition. the proposed approach is illustrated by its application to an example mass-spring system and the one rincon hill tower in san francisco.

analog_signal_processing	the objective of this paper is to upgrade a wireless sensing unit which can meet the following requirements: 1) improvement of system powering and analog signal processing 2) enhancement of signal resolution and provide reliable wireless communication data, 3) enhance capability for continuous long-term monitoring. based on the prototype of the wireless sensing unit developed by prof. lynch at the stanford university, the following upgrading steps are summarized: 1. reduce system noise by using smd passive elements and preventing the coupling digital and analog circuits, and increasing the capacity of power. 2. improve the adc sampling resolution and accuracy with a higher resolution analog-to-digital converter (adc): a 24bits adc with programmable gain amplifier. 3. improve wireless communication by using the wireless radio 9xtend which supported by the router (digi mesh) communication function using 900mhz frequency band. based on the upgrade wireless sensing unit, verification of the new wireless sensing unit was conducted from the ambient vibration survey of a base-isolated building. this new upgrade wireless sensing unit can provide more reliable data for continuous structural health monitoring. incorporated with the identification software (modified stochastic subspace identification method) the smart sensing system for shm is developed.
digital_control	the use of a digital architecture in pwm controllers for point-of-load (pol) applications, together with system identification techniques, allows the development of fully automated routines for in-situ system performance optimization where controller parameters are specifically tailored to the application. in this context, this paper proposes a method for performing parametric system identification of digitally controlled power converters using a conventional analog frequency response analyzer (fra). nonlinearities intrinsic to the digital loop are taken into account, thus leading to accurate estimation of converter parameters. the proposed method has been verified on a digitally controlled pol with v-in=12v, v-out=1.2v, i-out=10a and f(sw)=400khz for various bulk capacitor scenarios.
state_space_representation	we present a novel formulation that employs task-specific muscle synergies and state-space representation of neural signals to tackle the challenging myoelectric control problem for lower arm prostheses. the proposed framework incorporates information about muscle configurations, e.g., muscles acting synergistically or in agonist/antagonist pairs, using the hypothesis of muscle synergies. the synergy activation coefficients are modeled as the latent system state and are estimated using a constrained kalman filter. these task-dependent synergy activation coefficients are estimated in real-time from the electromyogram (emg) data and are used to discriminate between various tasks. the task discrimination is helped by a post-processing algorithm that uses posterior probabilities. the proposed algorithm is robust as well as computationally efficient, yielding a decision with >90% discrimination accuracy in approximately 3 ms. the real-time performance and controllability of the algorithm were evaluated using the targeted achievement control (tac) test. the proposed algorithm outperformed common machine learning algorithms for single-as well as multi-degree-of-freedom (dof) tasks in both off-line discrimination accuracy and real-time controllability (p < 0.01).
digital_control	in these days, three degree of freedom (3dof) cranes are considered as backbone in most of industries. it is mostly used for picking and placing of heavy objects from one place to another place. the common part in mostly cranes is jib system. two main tasks of jib system are movement of the trolley and loading/unloading of the payload. the safety of crane mostly depends upon these sub tasks. in most cases, number of unwanted vibrations due to undesirable initial jerks of trolley results uneven operation of crane. these jerks are usually happened during acceleration in the start and deceleration in the end of crane operation. so, it is desirable to develop a control technique that tries to reduce theses initial trolley jerks by providing a reasonable input to the trolley. moreover, reduction of jerks reduce the payload vibrations. so, it results smooth operation of crane. in this research work, we have implemented pd control technique for payload vibration and trolley position control of jib system of three 3dof crane. the gains of pd controllers have been found through two methods namely lqr and pole placement. the performance of controllers have been investigated on matlab/simulink. the results shows the effectiveness of pd tune by lqr as compared to pd tune by pole placement in context of settling time and rise time of both trolley position and payload vibrations. the former technique is also helpful in reduction of payload vibrations or payload load anti-swing. it has also improved the overshoot of the trolley.
system_identification	the presence of damage in a civil structure alters its stiffness and consequently its modal characteristics. the identification of these changes can provide engineers with useful information about the condition of a structure and constitutes the basic principle of the vibration-based structural health monitoring. while eigenfrequencies and mode shapes are the most commonly monitored modal characteristics, their sensitivity to structural damage may be low relative to their sensitivity to environmental influences. modal strains or curvatures could offer an attractive alternative but current measurement techniques encounter difficulties in capturing the very small strain (sub-microstrain) levels occurring during ambient, or operational excitation, with sufficient accuracy. this paper investigates the ability to obtain sub-microstrain accuracy with standard fiber-optic bragg gratings using a novel optical signal processing algorithm that identifies the wavelength shift with high accuracy and precision. the novel technique is validated in an extensive experimental modal analysis test on a steel i-beam which is instrumented with fbg sensors at its top and bottom flange. the raw wavelength fbg data are processed into strain values using both a novel correlation-based processing technique and a conventional peak tracking technique. subsequently, the strain time series are used for identifying the beam 's modal characteristics. finally, the accuracy of both algorithms in identification of modal characteristics is extensively investigated.
electric_motor	these days electrical motors are generally utilized as a part of our everyday life, no matter as small as in our laptop 's hard disc till as large as in other electrical machines, for example, fan, refrigerator, washing machine and many more. electric motors are the sources to drive or direct any equipment with mechanical perspective. this paper mainly focuses on the application of linear motion motors for the linear movement of image sensor. from the various electrical motors, stepper motor has advantage of micro stepping ability to manoeuvre it as per needed steps. stepper motor miniaturized scale venturing is finished by pulse width modulation of a varying current. considering the accuracy of every step is 3% to 5% and error inside the last step ca n't be collected into ensuing step, the stepper motor has higher position preciseness and sensible repetitive motion make them increasingly attractive for the image sensor applications. in this paper, diverse electric motors are examined and compared to see the benefits of each motor and identify the one that is more suitable to be utilized as a part of the movement of sensor/lens.

analog_signal_processing	this paper presents the design and measurement results of a novel frequency-mixing transimpedance amplifier (fm-tia), which is the key building block towards a monolithically integrated optical sensor front-end for frequency domain near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy (fd-nirs). the fm-tia employs a t-feedback network incorporating a gate-controlled transistor for resistance modulation, enabling the simultaneous down-conversion and amplification of the high frequency modulated photodiode (pd) current. the proposed fm-tia is capable of operating either in the traditional wideband mode or the frequency-mixing mode, depending on the applied gate control voltage. a wideband post amplifier is implemented on chip to characterize both modes for comparative study. the wideband mode achieves 107 db omega transimpedance gain with 200 mhz bandwidth for 4 pf photodiode capacitance. the measured total integrated input referred current noise is 158 na(rms). when the tia is modulated by a 100 mhz signal with 0.5 v amplitude in the mixing mode, it achieves 92 db omega conversion gain. the measured 1 db compression point is 3.1 mu a and iip3 is 10.6 mu a. the input-referred current noise integrated up to 50 khz is only 10.4, na(rms), which is 15 times lower than the wideband mode noise. the fm-tia together with the post amplifier draws 23 ma from a 1.8 v power supply, where the output buffer consumes 16.15 ma.
electric_motor	four adult (2m:2f) snow leopards (uncia uncia) were radio-monitored (vhf; one also via satellite) year-round during 1994-1997 in the altai mountains of southwestern mongolia where prey densities (i.e., ibex, capra siberica) were relatively low (-0.9/km(2)). marked animals were more active at night (51%) than during the day (35%). within the study area, marked leopards showed strong affinity for steep and rugged terrain, high use of areas rich in ungulate prey, and affinity for habitat edges. the satellite-monitored leopard moved more than 12 kin on 14% of consecutive days monitored. home ranges determined by standard telemetry techniques overlapped substantially and were at least 13-141 km(2) in size. however, the satellite-monitored individual apparently ranged over an area of at least 1590 km(2), and perhaps over as much as 4500 km(2). since telemetry attempts from the ground were frequently unsuccessful (x = 72%), we suspect all marked animals likely had large home ranges. relatively low prey abundance in the area also suggested that home ranges of >500 km(2) were not unreasonable to expect, though these are >10-fold larger than measured in any other part of snow leopard range. home ranges of snow leopards may be larger than we suspect in many areas, and thus estimation of snow leopard conservation status must rigorously consider logistical constraints inherent in telemetry studies, and the relative abundance of prey.

system_identification	a triaxial force-sensitive microrobot was developed to dynamically perturb skin in multiple deformation modes, in vivo. wiener static nonlinear identification was used to extract the linear dynamics and static nonlinearity of the force-displacement behavior of skin. stochastic input forces were applied to the volar forearm and thenar eminence of the hand, producing probe tip perturbations in indentation and tangential extension. wiener static nonlinear approaches reproduced the resulting displacements with variances accounted for (vaf) ranging 94-97%, indicating a good fit to the data. these approaches provided vaf improvements of 0.1-3.4% over linear models. thenar eminence stiffness measures were approximately twice those measured on the forearm. damping was shown to be significantly higher on the palm, whereas the perturbed mass typically was lower. coefficients of variation (cvs) for nonlinear parameters were assessed within and across individuals. individual cvs ranged from 2% to 11% for indentation and from 2% to 19% for extension. stochastic perturbations with incrementally increasing mean amplitudes were applied to the same test areas. differences between full-scale and incremental reduced-scale perturbations were investigated. different incremental preloading schemes were investigated. however, no significant difference in parameters was found between different incremental preloading schemes. incremental schemes provided depth-dependent estimates of stiffness and damping, ranging from 300 n/m and 2 ns/m, respectively, at the surface to 5 kn/m and 50 ns/m at greater depths. the device and techniques used in this research have potential applications in areas, such as evaluating skincare products, assessing skin hydration, or analyzing wound healing.
electric_motor	the purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of dentinal defects after root canal preparation with hand instruments and two different reciprocating instruments. sixty freshly extracted mandibular incisor teeth were selected for this in vitro study. on the basis of root length, mesiodistal and buccolingual dimensions, the teeth were allocated into three identical experimental groups (n = 15) and one control group (n = 15). the teeth in the control group were left unprepared. the other groups were: stainless steel hand instruments, waveone (r) primary instruments and reciproc (r) r25 instruments. the reciprocating instruments were used with a reciprocating gentle in-and-out motion in a torque-limited electric motor at the appropriate preset mode. horizontal sections were made 3, 6 and 9 mm from the apex. samples were stained with methylene blue and viewed through a stereomicroscope. the presence of dentinal defects (fractures, incomplete cracks and craze lines) and their locations were investigated by two endodontists. these data were analysed statistically by fisher 's exact and chi-square tests. no defects were observed in the unprepared group. all instruments caused dentinal defects, with no significant differences between the instrument systems. all experimental groups demonstrated significantly more defects at the 3-mm level in comparison with the unprepared group (p = 0.032). at the other levels, there was no significant difference between the experimental groups and the control group. the use of hand or reciprocating instruments could induce the formation of dentinal defects during root canal preparation.
microcontroller	owing to various advantages over conventional drying systems, microwave drying technology has been widely applied to vast industrial applications. during microwave drying especially in high moisture content products such as fruits and vegetables, temperature will increase dramatically since they are very responsive to microwave absorption. the characteristics of materials may change with the uncontrolled temperature and result in thermal burning and non-uniform temperature distribution in treated materials. to ensure the effective control without the material degradation, in this paper we propose the automatic phase-controlled of magnetron driver based on temperature detection. the low cost and non-contact infrared temperature measurement is implemented and evaluated in microwave environment. the objective of this proposed control is to automatically control the power output of the magnetron according to the actual product temperature. the hardware component selections and software flowchart are described. the feedback control algorithm based on microcontroller arduino mega 2560 is also presented in details. experimental results of the proposed automatic temperature control of microwave drying system are investigated and verified the effectiveness of the proposed control system.
electrical_circuits	leaf movements in mimosa pudica, are in response to thermal stress, touch, and light or darkness, appear to be regulated by electrical, hydrodynamical, and chemical signal transduction. the pulvinus of the m. pudica shows elastic properties. we have found that the movements of the petiole, or pinnules, are accompanied by a change of the pulvinus morphing structures. after brief flaming of a pinna, the volume of the lower part of the pulvinus decreases and the volume of the upper part increases due to the redistribution of electrolytes between these parts of the pulvinus; as a result of these changes the petiole falls. during the relaxation of the petiole, the process goes in the opposite direction. ion and water channel blockers, uncouplers as well as anesthetic agents diethyl ether or chloroform decrease the speed of alert wave propagation along the plant. brief flaming of a pinna induces bidirectional propagation of electrical signal in pulvini. transduction of electrical signals along a pulvinus induces generation of an action potential in perpendicular direction between extensor and flexor sides of a pulvinus. inhibition of signal transduction and mechanical responses in m. pudica by volatile anesthetic agents chloroform or by blockers of voltage gated ion channels shows that the generation and propagation of electrical signals is a primary effect responsible for turgor change and propagation of an excitation. there is an electrical coupling in a pulvinus similar to the electrical synapse in the animal nerves.

control_engineering	verifying that complex systems such as power plants satisfy the requirements that ensure their proper operation, in particular with respect to safety, dependability and environmental regulations, is difficult due to the large number of potential situations to be explored in terms of initiating events and their chain of consequences on the behavior of the system. the paper presents a new framework for supporting a methodology that aims at reconciling innovation (ability to modify the system) and safety (ability to comply with regulatory requirements). the general principle is to produce independently formal models of the requirements, of the possible variants of the design, and of the dynamic behavior of the system for the possible designs, then assemble them together to simulate the full system 's behavior to automatically detect possible violations of the requirements.
signal-flow_graph	the next generation wireless local area networks (wlans) with enhanced throughput performance have attracted significant amounts of attention in recent years. based on the ieee 802.11n standard, frame aggregation is considered one of the major factors to improve the system performance of wlans from the medium access control perspective. in order to fulfill the requirements of the high throughput performance, feasible design of automatic repeat request (arq) mechanisms is considered important for providing reliable data transmission. in this paper, an aggregated selective repeat arq (asr-arq) algorithm is proposed, which incorporate the conventional selective repeat arq scheme with the consideration of frame aggregation. a novel analytical model based on the signal flow graph is established in order to realize the behaviors of asr-arq algorithm. simulations are also conducted to validate the effectiveness of proposed asr-arq mechanism.

pid_controller	this paper studies the use of a fuzzy proportional integral derivative (pid) controller based on a genetic algorithm (ga) in a docking maneuver of two spacecraft in the space environment. the docking maneuver consists of two parts: translation and orientation. to derive governing equations for the translational phase, hill linear equations in a local vertical-local horizontal (lvlh) frame will be used. in fuzzy pid (fpid) controller design, two fuzzy inference motors will be utilized. the single input fuzzy inference motor (sifim) is the first to have only one input, and for each state variable, a separate sifim is defined. another fuzzy inference motor, the preferrer fuzzy inference motor (pfim), represents the control priority order of each state variable and a supervisory role in large deviations. this fpid controller covers a servicer 's translation of a docking maneuver, which tries to dock with a stable nonrotating target. various conflicting objective functions are distance errors from the set point and control efforts. to enter the control limit in an optimization problem, the maximal value of the thrust force is constrained. considering these objective functions, a statistical analysis on the ga parameters will be performed, and the test with the best minimum fuel consumption and minimum deviations of the servicer from the equilibrium point will be chosen as the best test. the three-dimensional (3d) pareto frontiers corresponding to the best test will be plotted, and the optimal points related to the objective functions will be demonstrated on them; the time response figures corresponding to these points will then be generated. the results prove that this controller shows an efficient performance in the docking maneuver of the servicer spacecraft. in comparison with similar work, a number of system performance parameters (e.g., settling time) will be improved, and overshoot (as a critical parameter in docking maneuver) will be truncated.

electric_motor	tight integration of cyber-dominated control systems and physical systems has helped electric vehicles (ev) as a cyber-physical system (cps) to achieve zero-emission transportation capability. however, it poses major difficulties such as poor driving range, high price, and troublesome recharging which demotivate their consumers. these problems have arisen due to the stringent constraints on the ev battery packs. moreover, the battery capacity degrades overtime and this degradation defines the battery lifetime and shortens the driving range further. the driving range and battery lifetime are mainly influenced by the route behavior, electric motor, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) power consumption. in this paper, we present a novel jointly optimized eco-friendly automotive climate control and navigation system methodology. the integration between these two systems helps us to optimize the hvac utilization and route for better battery lifetime and driving range. we have compared the performance of our methodology with the state-of-the-arts for different weather and route behavior. we have seen upto 24% improvement in battery lifetime and 17% reduction in energy consumption.
electricity	important energy reductions can be achieved in the building sector by providing occupants with feedback about their energy-consumption levels. recent studies link the success of energy-feedback methods to the level of occupant engagement with people in their social circles and the resulting peer pressure to conform to certain social norms. despite promising results, the literature remains limited in scope to individual rather than groups of buildings. this has limited the design of feedback initiatives leveraging social connections that exist, or that can be induced, within and between buildings. the current paper addresses the identified gap by proposing a multilayer agent-based model that serves as a test bed to simulate and optimize feedback methods applied on any building stock (e.g.,community and city). monte carlo and sensitivity analyses show that connecting occupants of different buildings, while increasing their engagement with the feedback mechanism, can lead to energy reductions exceeding 10%. the findings confirm the role of social networks in energy-conservation diffusion, setting the stage for large-scale and socially engaging energy-conservation initiatives.

signal-flow_graph	a general synthesis procedure is given for a versatile signal flow graph realization of a general transfer function by using current differencing buffered amplifier (cdba). the proposed configuration uses n + 1 cdbas, n capacitors and at most 2n + 4 resistors. this number of resistors can be reduced to n + i for special cases. the circuit is eligible to obtain a variety of transfer characteristics with the same common denominator polynomial, and it is easily converted to different modes of operations. it is straightforward to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized. simulations results are obtained by using commercially available active component ad844 and cmos technology as well. all of these make the proposed circuit attractive.

signal-flow_graph	the input-output weight enumerator of a convolutional code characterizes the distance spectrum and allows error probability bounds to be conveniently evaluated. to efficiently compute the weight enumerator, pimentel recently introduced the so-called state reduction algorithm which has a convenient implementation using existing symbolic mathematical software. in this paper, we propose a dynamic state elimination ordering heuristic to further accelerate the algorithm. as demonstrated by our empirical results, the accelerated state reduction algorithm can achieve impressive complexity savings relative to the original algorithm when applied to compute the weight enumerators and its various truncated versions of convolutional codes with moderate-to-large constraint lengths.
analog_signal_processing	digital signal processing techniques were employed to investigate the joint use of charge division and risetime analyses for the resistive anode (ra) coupled to a microchannel plate detector (mcp). in contrast to the typical approach of using the relative charge at each corner of the ra, this joint approach results in a significantly improved position resolution. a conventional charge division analysis utilizing analog signal processing provides a measured position resolution of 170 mu m (fwhm). by using the correlation between risetime and position we were able to obtain a measured resolution of 92 mu m (fwhm), corresponding to an intrinsic resolution of 64 mu m (fwhm) for a single z-stack mcp detector.

pid_controller	analytical methods are usually applied for tuning fractional controllers. the present paper proposes an empirical method for tuning a new type of fractional controller known as pid-fractional-order-filter (fof-pid). indeed, the setpoint overshoot method, initially introduced by shamsuzzoha and skogestad, has been adapted for tuning fof-pid controller. based on simulations for a range of first order with time delay processes, correlations have been derived to obtain pid-fof controller parameters similar to those obtained by the internal model control (imc) tuning rule. the setpoint overshoot method requires only one closed-loop step response experiment using a proportional controller (p-controller). to highlight the potential of this method, simulation results have been compared with those obtained with the imc method as well as other pertinent techniques. various case studies have also been considered. the comparison has revealed that the proposed tuning method performs as good as the imc. moreover, it might offer a number of advantages over the imc tuning rule. for instance, the parameters of the fractional controller are directly obtained from the setpoint closed-loop response data without the need of any model of the plant to be controlled.

electric_motor	satellite radio-location data from 57 adult male pacific walruses (odobenus rosmarus divergens) were used to estimate haul-out fidelity, broadly describe seasonal foraging distributions, and determine the approximate timing of autumn migration from bristol bay, alaska. data were collected intermittently during 1987-91 and 1995-2000, primarily during the period from may to october. transmitter longevity ranged from less than i day to 560 days (median 75 d). the four tagging sites were the only haul-outs that were commonly used in the bay from spring through autumn. mean fidelity, defined as the chance that an animal will return to an area where it previously hauled out, was 0.56 (se = 0.09). however, small sample sizes precluded comparisons of fidelity among years and among haul-outs by season. no tagged animals migrated out of the bay between spring and early autumn. combined monthly locations suggest that foraging occurred primarily in the southern and eastern areas of the bay in spring and gradually shifted towards northwestern areas in late autumn and winter. ninety-eight percent of the in-water locations were in waters under 60 m deep, which account for 76% of the study area. some animals migrated out of the bay in late autumn and winter; others remained within the bay throughout the year. those making long-range migrations departed the bay during november and december.
system_identification	nonlinear system identification is a vast research field, today attracting a great deal of attention in the structural dynamics community. ten years ago, an mssp paper reviewing the progress achieved until then [1] concluded that the identification of simple continuous structures with localised nonlinearities was within reach. the past decade witnessed a shift in emphasis, accommodating the growing industrial need for a first generation of tools capable of addressing complex nonlinearities in larger-scale structures. the objective of the present paper is to survey the key developments which arose in the field since 2006, and to illustrate state-of-the-art techniques using a real-world satellite structure. finally, a broader perspective to nonlinear system identification is provided by discussing the central role played by experimental models in the design cycle of engineering structures.

electrical_circuits	carbon fiber (cf) composites of organometallic intercalated polyaniline (pani) and polypyrrole (ppy) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (pss) were electrochemically synthesized and tested as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. from the results obtained by cyclic voltammetry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, it was concluded that the incorporation of copper(ii) ions in the polymeric composite was successfully attained by adsorption of cu2+ ions and 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (dmct) monomers on the carbon microfibers. the experimental electrochemical impedance response of the obtained pani(dmct-cu ion)/cf composite was simulated by adequate equivalent electrical circuits. after 20 charge/discharge cycles, the experimental discharge specific capacity of the pani(dmct-cu ion)/cf composite was 118 ma h g(-1) (100% coulombic efficiency) using a 1 mol l-1 liclo4 solution in propylene carbonate, and 110 ma h g(-1) when a polymeric electrolyte was used. in the charge/discharge tests of the ppy-pss/pani/cf composite as anode, a high discharge specific capacity of 225 ma h g(-1) was obtained after 20 cycles. the resulting ppy-pss/pani/cf/polymeric electrolyte/pani(dmct-cu ion)/cf battery presented a specific capacity of 62 ma h g(-1) and could be charged up to 2.0 v, yielding an energy density 425 w h g(-1), with a coulombic efficiency of about 98%.

lorentz_force_law	this paper presents the torque model of a ball-joint-like three-degree-of-freedom (3-dof) permanent magnet (pm) spherical actuator. this actuator features a ball-shaped rotor with multiple pm poles and a spherical stator with circumferential air-core coils. an analytical expression of the magnetic field of the rotor is obtained based on laplace 's equation. based on this expression and properties of air-core stator coils, lorentz force law is employed for the study of the relationship between the rotor torque and coil input currents. by using linear superposition, the expression of the actuator torque in terms of current input to the stator coils can be obtained in a matrix form. the linear expression of the actuator torque will facilitate real-time motion control of the actuator as a servo system. experimental works are carried out to measure the actual magnetic field distribution of the pm rotor in three-diamensional (3-d) space as well as to measure the actual 3-d motor torque generated by the actuator coils. the measurement results were coincident with analytical study on the rotor magnetic field distribution and actuator torque expressions. the linearity and superposition of the actuator torque were also verified through the experiments.
system_identification	a control-oriented, two-timescale, linear, dynamic, response model of the rotational transform iota profile and the normalized beta beta(n) is proposed based on experimental data from the diii-d tokamak. dedicated system-identification experiments without feedback control have been carried out to generate data for the development of this model. the data-driven dynamic model, which is both device-specific and scenario-specific, represents the response of the iota profile and beta(n) to the electric field due to induction as well as to the heating and current drive (h&cd) systems during the flat-top phase of an h-mode discharge in diii-d. the control goal is to use both induction and the h&cd systems to locally regulate the plasma iota profile and beta(n) around particular target values close to the reference state used for system identification. a singular value decomposition (svd) of the plasma model at steady state is carried out to decouple the system and identify the most relevant control channels. a mixed-sensitivity robust control design problem is formulated based on the dynamic model to synthesize a stabilizing feedback controller without input constraints that minimizes the reference tracking error and rejects external disturbances with minimal control energy. the feedback controller is then augmented with an anti-windup compensator, which keeps the given controller well-behaved in the presence of magnitude constraints in the actuators and leaves the nominal closed-loop system unmodified when no saturation is present. the proposed controller represents one of the first feedback profile controllers integrating magnetic and kinetic variables ever implemented and experimentally tested in diii-d. the preliminary experimental results presented in this work, although limited in number and constrained by actuator problems and design limitations, as it will be reported, show good progress towards routine current profile control in diii-d and leave valuable lessons for further advancements in the field.

voltage_law	this paper presents a simple approach for load flow analysis of a radial distribution network with embedded generation. the proposed approach utilizes forward and backward sweep algorithm based on kirchoff 's current law (kcl) and kirchoff 's voltage law (kvl) for evaluating the node voltages iteratively. in this approach, computation of branch current depends only on the current injected at the neighbouring node and the current in the adjacent branch. this approach starts from the end nodes of sub lateral line, lateral line and main line and moves towards the root node during branch current computation. the node voltage evaluation begins fro in the root node and moves towards the nodes located at the far end of the main, lateral and sub lateral lines. the proposed approach has been tested using three radial distribution systems of different size and configuration and is found to be computationally efficient. the effectiveness of the proposed approach is further demonstrated by integrating the embedded generation into the load flow analysis of the radial distribution network.
digital_control	the division-summation (d-sigma) current control and one-cycle voltage regulation (ocvr) of a 5-kw surface-mounted permanent-magnet synchronous generator (spmsg) drive is developed. with the advancement of motor manufacturing, motor design, digital control units and power electronics converters, the permanent-magnet synchronous generator (pmsg) is broadly applied to electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, flywheel energy storage system and wind power generators. satisfactory current control scheme of a pmsg is significant to achieve desired generating performance. the d-sigma current control is proposed and derived from the conventional space-vector modulation and two-phase modulation. a simplification of the complex self-and mutual inductances in a pmsg is demonstrated. the proposed current control can achieve the current waveform tracking through the simplification of winding inductances without parameter designing procedure of the feedback controller. the computation time of the microcontroller is reduced via the proposed current control scheme. the processing times of the conventional control and the d-sigma control are compared. moreover, the dc-link voltage can be well regulated by the proposed ocvr. this method can reduce the complexity of the voltage controller design. the merits of these two methods are easy to implement and the parameter designing procedure of the feedback controller is unnecessary. in addition, the system stability and the parameter sensitivity are analyzed and evaluated. some measured waveforms verify the current tracking, torque ripple, dynamic performance and voltage regulation of the spmsg drive. the reduction of the switching losses is verified by the calculation results.

electrical_circuits	this paper discusses diffusion of a pulsed magnetic field into a resistive element fabricated from a low-carbon steel. the developed numerical model shows that the process of the magnetic field diffusion into the steel at the leading edge of the pulse can be conventionally described by three stages: initial stage extending up to saturation of the steel surface layers, stage of saturation when the discharge current diffuses into the bulk of the steel, and stage of conduction when the discharge current is distributed practically uniformly in the steel. approximate analytical relations describing the voltage drop across the resistive element are derived for each of the three stages. these relations are used for estimation of the effect of the ferromagnetic properties of the steel on transients in electrical circuits with the resistive element. experiments prove the validity of the obtained analytical results.
system_identification	underwater gliders are used for deep-water gliding to observe large areas with minimal energy consumption. the pitch angle of the underwater glider is an important control parameter. this study involved designing a fuzzy-pid controller for the pitch angle of an underwater glider based on hydrodynamics analysis. the formula of pitch angle is obtained and a system identification method was used to identify the transfer function based on the time-domain equation and initial experimental data. the fuzzy-pid control algorithm was used to design the controller. lake and sea trials indicated that the minimum overshoot reached 0% and the settling time was about 34s when the change of the angle was 15 degrees. the minimum steady-state error was 0.8 degrees. these advantages could reduce the consumption of energy and improve the accuracy of gliding trajectory. therefore, this control algorithm should be applied to control the pitch of the gliders.

state_space_representation	the subsampling of a linear periodically time-varying system results in a collection of linear time-invariant systems with common poles. this key fact, known as ""lifting"", is used in a two-step realization method. the first step is the realization of the time-invariant dynamics (the lifted system). computationally, this step is a rank-revealing factorization of a block-hankel matrix. the second step derives a state space representation of the periodic time-varying system. it is shown that no extra computations are required in the second step. the computational complexity of the overall method is therefore equal to the complexity for the realization of the lifted system. a modification of the realization method is proposed, which makes the complexity independent of the parameter variation period. replacing the rank-revealing factorization in the realization algorithm by structured low-rank approximation yields a maximum likelihood identification method. existing methods for structured low-rank approximation are used to identify efficiently a linear periodically time-varying system. these methods can deal with missing data.

system_identification	in this study, the authors propose an l(0)-norm penalised shrinkage linear least mean squares (l(0)-sh-lms) algorithm and an l(0)-norm penalised shrinkage widely linear least mean squares (l(0)-sh-wl-lms) algorithm for sparse system identification. the proposed algorithms exploit the priori and the posteriori errors to calculate the varying step-size, thus they can adapt to the time-varying channel. meanwhile, in the cost function they introduce a penalty term that favours sparsity to enable the applicability for sparse condition. moreover, the l(0)-sh-wl-lms algorithm also makes full use of the non-circular properties of the signals of interest to improve the tracking capability and estimation performance. quantitative analysis of the convergence behaviour for the l(0)-sh-wl-lms algorithm verifies the capabilities of the proposed algorithms. simulation results show that compared with the existing least mean squares-type algorithms, the proposed algorithms perform better in the sparse channels with a faster convergence rate and a lower steady-state error. when channel changes suddenly, a filter with the proposed algorithms can adapt to the variation of the channel quickly.
control_engineering	in many control engineering problems, it is desired to analyze the systems at particular frequency intervals of interest. this paper focuses on the development of frequency interval cross gramians for both linear and bilinear systems. new generalized sylvester equations for calculating the frequency interval cross gramians are derived in order to be used to obtain information regarding controllability and observability within a single matrix. the advantage of the proposed method is that it is computationally more efficient compared to existing gramian-based techniques since only half of the number of equations need to be solved in order to obtain information regarding the controllability and observability of a system compared to existing techniques. numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed method which uses frequency interval cross gramians relative to existing methods.

microcontroller	the security of information transmission is of paramount importance in all sectors of society, whether civilian or defence related. in ancient times the encryption of secret messages was mainly realized by physical or chemical means, but this was later supplemented by mathematical techniques. in parallel, the breaking of enemy codes has also been a subject of intense study. to date, the only known absolutely secure means of encryption is through quantum cryptography. however, this still has to be implemented by equipment that is vulnerable to various physical attacks, so it is important to study these methods of attack, both for legitimate users and for the surveillance of criminal activities. today, nearly all transactions have to be realized through the computer and much effort has been devoted to cracking the software. however, little attention has been paid to the hardware, and it has only recently been realized that computer chips themselves can leak sensitive information, from which a code may even be deciphered. by studying the photonic emission and the data dependency of a cryptographic chip during operation, the correspondence between the hamming weight of the operand and the number of photons emitted may be established, based on which a simple and effective method is proposed to crack the advanced encryption standard (aes) cipher chip. an experimental platform has been set up for measuring and analyzing the leaked photonic emission using time-correlated single-photon counting. an at89c52 microcontroller implementing the operation of the aes cipher algorithm is used as a cipher chip. the emitted photons are collected when the first addroundkey and subbytes of the aes encryption arithmetic are executed, and their respective numbers are found to have a linear relationship with the operand hamming weight. the sources of noise affecting the photon emission trace have been analyzed, so that the measurement error and uncertainty can be reduced effectively. with the help of our hamming weight simulation model, by selecting one or several groups of plain text and comparing the corresponding relationship between the hamming weight of the intermediate values and the number of photons emitted by the cipher chip, the key of the aes encryption algorithm has been successfully recovered and cracked. this confirms the effectiveness of this method of attack, which can therefore pose a severe threat to the security of the aes cipher chip. for the next step in the future, our method will be optimized to narrow the search range, and also combined with other photonic emission analysis attacks (such as simple photonic emission analysis and differential photonic emission analysis) to improve the efficiency. a comparison and evaluation of the various methods will be made. at the same time, our current experimental configuration will be improved to obtain a better collection efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio.
state_space_representation	with the increase in the urban population witnessed in all major cities worldwide, efficient urban traffic planning, modeling and control are indispensable. in this paper we propose a novel macro-model for urban networks based on queuing theory and cast in a state-space representation. the model for each junction incorporates a switching mechanism capturing both the nonlinear dynamics of normal traffic conditions and the linear evolution of vehicle queues during junction block-back scenarios. moreover, while competing models suffer a quadratic increase in computational cost with every added junction, our model exhibits only a linear increase in dimensionality and thus significantly lowers its computational demands. the simulation results from the proposed model are validated against a standard micro-modelling simulation package. these results will demonstrate through a monte carlo simulation that given correct model parameters, the proposed macro-model can well capture the complex vehicle dynamics of an urban region, thus paving the way for an accurate analysis of the network and for the development of efficient urban traffic control strategies.

state_space_representation	building energy simulation programs in most cases solve heat conduction through walls by considering one-dimensional heat flows, neglecting thermal bridges. the paper shows a new method for implementing bi-dimensional and three-dimensional heat transfer in dynamic energy simulation software, allowing a great improvement of their capabilities. the new procedure starts from the theory of state space representation of transfer functions, and then introduces simplifications for reducing computational time and the required cpu sources. starting from a first case study, aimed to verify the achievable correspondence of the simplified new method compared to the original one, two common thermal bridges have been deeply analysed, comparing the proposed methodologies and numerical solution based on using finite volume methods. the investigated building structures determine bi-dimensional heat flows because of discontinuities in both materials and geometry. by comparing the achieved outcomes to those derived by much more onerous cfd studies, several cases changing grid refinement, timestep, ambient condition and so on, the proposed method shows its suitability, with maximum errors never higher than 4.5%, also under hourly-variable outdoor temperature and solar radiation.

system_identification	two methods have been compared for the determination of the inertial properties of a small, fixed-wing un-manned aerial vehicle. the first method uses the standard single degree of freedom pendulum method and the second method implements a novel, potentially easier, 3 degrees of freedom pendulum method, which yields the entire inertia tensor from a single swing test. both methods are using system identification of the pendulum motion to estimate the inertial properties. substantial corrections (up to 25%) have to be applied to the experimental results. these corrections are caused by the acceleration of the pendulum being immersed in the surrounding air, also called the added mass effect. it has been found that the methods presented in literature to determine the corrections for full-scale aircraft do not give the correct results for the small-scale un-manned aerial vehicle under consideration. the only feasible, cost-effective method to generate these corrections utilise swing tests with a geometrically similar object of known inertial properties. it has also been found that the corrections are unique with respect to the experimental methods. several benchmarking methods, including the innovative use of static and dynamic wind-tunnel test data, give high confidence in the results.
pid_controller	this study studies the precision motion control of a developed planar motor motion system under the existence of external disturbance, non-linearity, uncertainty, and crosstalk coupling problems those inevitably deteriorate the achievable control object and even make the system unstable. to address these issues, an integrated robust tracking controller consists of feedforward (ff), proportional-integral-derivative (pid), and robust compensator (rc), is developed for the planar motor stage to practically achieve high control performance. specifically, the ff term is designed based on the stage dynamics model to reduce the tracking error, and the pid term is synthesised by pole assignment to stabilise the nominal model. more importantly, rc is particularly designed to suppress the effects of equivalent lumped disturbances including the external disturbances, uncertainties, non-linearities, and crosstalk couplings. the proposed integrated controller possesses robust stability under the uncertain disturbances, and facilitates parameter tuning which is meaningful for practical implementation. finally, comparative experiments are conducted on a developed planar motor of wafer stage, and the results validate the practical effectiveness and high-performance nature of the proposed control strategy.
voltage_law	this paper introduces a novel backward/forward sweep algorithm for both fundamental and harmonics flow calculation in distribution network. in this algorithm, the fundamental and harmonic currents of each branch are calculated by equivalent current injection method. the relationship between branch currents and harmonic currents of each order on a radial feeder can be calculated by summing the injection current from the receiving end toward the sending end of the feeder. after obtaining the branch currents, both the harmonics bus voltage and the fundamental bus voltage can be easily obtained from the sending end to the receiving end based on the kirchhoff 's voltage law. by using this method, the lu decomposition is avoided and it will save huge computational time. base on special hierarchy characteristic of radial network, the branches are sorted by layers. so that the branch power loss and voltage drop can be computed in parallel at each level. the computational time can be further reduced. the test results demonstrate the flexible, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.
pid_controller	in this paper, the considered hybrid power system (hps) is having a wind turbine generator, a diesel engine generator (deg) and a storage device (such as capacitive energy storage). this paper presents a comparative study of frequency and power control for the studied isolated wind-diesel hps with four different classical controllers for the pitch control of wind turbines and the speed governor control of deg the classical controllers considered are integral, proportional-integral, integral-derivative and proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller. a quasi-oppositional harmony search (qohs) algorithm is proposed for the tuning of the controller gains. the comparative dynamic simulation response results indicate that better performance may be achieved with choosing pid controller among the considered classical controllers, when subjected to different perturbation. stability and sensitivity analysis, presented in this paper, reveals that the optimized pid controller gains offered by the proposed qohs algorithm are quite robust and need not be reset for wide changes in system perturbations.

system_identification	recent development of system identification using bayesian models or stochastic filtering provides probabilistic descriptions (i.e., probability density function or statistical parameters like mean and variance) of the identified model parameters (e.g., mass, stiffness, and damping). optimal design of passive controllers for these systems whose parameters are uncertain has remained an open problem. with this in view, the present study aims to develop numerical solution scheme for the optimal design of tuned mass damper (tmd) operating in uncertain environment. deterministic design of tmd in these cases suffers detuning as the system parameters are random. thus, a reliability-based design optimization (rbdo) scheme is presented in this paper for better performance of the tmd when exposed to uncertainties. to solve the rbdo problem, response surface methodology is used along with the moving least squares technique. dual response surfaces are used for separate handling of optimization and reliability analysis. first response surface performs optimization of the design variables of tmd, while the second response surfaces are used for the estimation of the statistical properties like mean and variance to satisfy the constrained conditions. numerical analysis is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for rbdo of single degree of freedom-tmd system as a proof of concept. the proposed meta-model-based algorithm can be applied for the optimal design of controller for large structures where conventional technique may face difficulty to handle both optimization and uncertainty quantification simultaneously. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.

control_engineering	today, manufacturers do not fully leverage the potential of computer aided engineering (cae) for the design of machine tools and production machines. common design tools for drive systems and other machine components build on an algebraic system description. however, dynamic quality criteria that have a significant impact on the achievable accuracy and productivity cannot be evaluated with purely algebraic descriptions. generally, dynamic criteria can be incorporated in signal-oriented models from control engineering, but the modeling process is time-consuming, knowledge-intensive and the reusability of models is limited. this paper presents a methodology to simplify the optimization of machine components, such as feed drives, while taking dynamic quality criteria into account. the method is based on the object-and component-oriented modeling language modelica. for the quick development of models with limited expert-knowledge the models are integrated in an extensible model library. modern mathematical optimization methods support the systematic search for a combination of system components and parameters with regards to the defined quality criteria. therefore different design alternatives can quickly be analyzed and compared.

pid_controller	bobbin tool friction stir welding (btfsw) is a relatively new, solid-state welding technology, but its control is not the same as the conventional friction stir welding (fsw) due to the unique welding tool structure. in this paper, closed-loop control system was developed and the smith predictive proportional-integral-derivative (pid) control method was presented to assist the welding system in producing an appropriate interface temperature response. as it is difficult to accurately detect the temperature in full range of the welding zone, the tool-workpiece interface temperature is detected by thermocouple and wireless transmission technology. initial experiments were conducted to derive a qualitative understanding of bobbin tool friction stir welding processes. ziegler-nichols setting method was adopted to determine parameters of the pid controller. while examining the capabilities of smith predictive pid control in btfsw, this paper focuses on the control effect of hysteretic characteristics of welding temperature during butt welding. a compensation strategy was setting gaps along the welding path, and the gap could affect the distribution of temperature. through our experiments, we demonstrate that temperature control strategy is feasible, and the tensile properties of the weld are uniform along the welding direction.
microcontroller	a new pulsed-flow design of hose-based solar collector is presented, which uses a long hose connected to district-grid water in the same way that the basic hose design does. but on contrary that this last, here the exit is not connected directly to consumption and instead the hot water flow is controlled by a thermostat that purges the hose to an insulated tank every time it reaches the desired temperature. so, this water-pond collector works close its maximum efficiency along the day and minimizes nocturnal cooling effect, improving noticeably the performance of the original hose design. as was demonstrated by thermal modeling, this new pulsed-flow design could satisfy the domestic demand of sanitary hot water even in high-latitude locations and furthermore, its performance could be noticeably improved by adding a smart microcontroller. the economic analysis shows this design could be highly competitive applied to large hot-water demands and relatively good for single family demands.

electric_motor	in recent years a lot of research has been done about electric hybrid vehicles (hv) (including those with internal combustion engine or fuel cell). the main aim of the studies has been the design of an electric system capable of feeding an electric motor, giving the same or similar performance as an internal combustion engine vehicle (icev). this is the first step for substituting the icev for hvs, since the final user will not accept any downgrade. nowadays, cars bring other kind of services that make the vehicle more comfortable. air conditioning is one of them. all the modern vehicles must be prepared to include an air conditioning system (acs), even in the smallest sizes. therefore the acs and its effects over the energy management must be taken into account in the design of a hv. the power consumption of the acs depends directly on the thermal load of the vehicle cabin (latent and sensible), the ambient conditions and the dc/dc converter efficiency between compressor and car power system of the car. the main objective of the research is to analyze the behavior of a fuel cell car under different driving cycles, ambient conditions and passenger load. the fuel consumption data is taken performing the cycles. an increment of hydrogen consumption between 3 and 12.1% was found when the acs is switched on. copyright (c) 2015, hydrogen energy publications, llc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
system_identification	parameter estimation plays an important role in modeling and system identification. however, parameter estimation of chaotic systems has some basic differences with other dynamical systems due to butterfly effect. in this paper, we apply a new cost function for parameter estimation in a very interesting chaotic system, a system with a plane of equilibrium which belongs to a newly introduced category of dynamical systems: systems with hidden attractor. the nonlinear dynamics of this system is described in terms of equilibria and its stability, phase portraits, bifurcation diagram and lyapunov exponents. in order to minimize the proposed cost function and obtain the correct parameters, we use a new efficient optimization method, krill herd algorithm. the results show the success of proposed procedures.
system_identification	in conventional hybrid simulation (hs) and real time hybrid simulation (rths) applications, the information exchanged between the experimental substructure and numerical substructure is typically restricted to the interface boundary conditions (force, displacement, acceleration, etc.). with additional demands being placed on rths and recent advances in recursive system identification techniques, an opportunity arises to improve the fidelity by extracting information from the experimental substructure. online model updating algorithms enable the numerical model of components (herein named the target model), that are similar to the physical specimen to be modified accordingly. this manuscript demonstrates the power of integrating a model updating algorithm into rths (rthsmu) and explores the possible challenges of this approach through a practical simulation. two bouc-wen models with varying levels of complexity are used as target models to validate the concept and evaluate the performance of this approach. the constrained unscented kalman filter (cukf) is selected for using in the model updating algorithm. the accuracy of rthsmu is evaluated through an estimation output error indicator, a model updating output error indicator, and a system identification error indicator. the results illustrate that, under applicable constraints, by integrating model updating into rths, the global response accuracy can be improved when the target model is unknown. a discussion on model updating parameter sensitivity to updating accuracy is also presented to provide guidance for potential users.

system_identification	recent contributions have framed linear system identification as a nonparametric regularized inverse problem. relying on l(2)-type regularization which accounts for the stability and smoothness of the impulse response to be estimated, these approaches have been shown to be competitive w.r.t. classical parametric methods. in this paper, adopting maximum entropy arguments, we derive a new l(2) penalty; to do so we exploit the structure of the hankel matrix, thus controlling at the same time complexity, measured by the mcmillan degree, stability and smoothness of the identified models. as a special case, we recover the nuclear norm penalty on the squared block hankel matrix. in contrast with the previous literature on reweighted nuclear norm penalties, our kernel is described by a small number of hyper-parameters, which are iteratively updated through marginal likelihood maximization; constraining the structure of the kernel acts as a (hyper)regularizer which helps controlling the effective degrees of freedom of our estimator. to optimize the marginal likelihood, we adapt a scaled gradient projection (sgp) algorithm which is proved to be significantly computationally cheaper than other first and second order off-the-shelf optimization methods. the paper also contains an extensive comparison with many state-of-the-art methods on several monte-carlo studies, which confirms the effectiveness of our procedure.

system_identification	system identification of structures is one of the important aspects of structural health monitoring. the accuracy and efficiency of identification results is affected severely by measurement noises, especially when the structure system is large, such as bridge structures, and when online system identification is required. in this paper, the least square estimation (lse) method is used combined with the substructure approach for identifying structural parameters of a cable-stay bridge with large degree of freedoms online. numerical analysis is carried out by first dividing the bridge structure into smaller substructures and then estimates the parameters of each substructure online using lse method. simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of identifying structural parameters, however, the accuracy and efficiency of identification results depend highly on the noise sensitivities of loading region, loading pattern as well as element size.
digital_control	in this paper, we illustrate a proposed method for control that combines the outputs of several individual controllers to improve global control of complex nonlinear plants. in the first part of this paper, we illustrate the proposed method that consists of two levels, where in the top level a fuzzy system represents a superior control that is designed for adjusting the behavior of the individual fuzzy controllers at the lower level. to test the approach, we consider the problem of flight control because it requires several individual controllers. also a comparison is performed, where the hierarchical control strategy is compared with a simple control approach using the t student test. in this paper, we show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional fuzzy control approach. in the optimal design of the proposed control architecture a genetic algorithm was also applied to tune the parameters of the fuzzy systems in an optimal fashion.

system_identification	a set of novel explicit expressions for the identification of stable, unstable and integrating first-order plus dead time process dynamics is presented. in the absence of sensor noise/static load disturbances, an autonomous relay control system with an asymmetrical relay induces a smooth limit cycle at the process output. dynamic model parameters are estimated using the set of proposed expressions which depend on the parameters of limit cycle output and its derivatives. however, in practice, the process output is generally corrupted by the measurement noise, thereby rendering an erroneous identification of process dynamics. furthermore, static load disturbance during an identification test also induces an asymmetrical limit cycle output resulting in inaccurate measurements. hence, a fast fourier transform technique and biased relay feedback methods are implemented to obviate the problem of asymmetries and chattering in the limit cycle output yielding the original limit cycle and its subsequent derivatives. the proposed method has been validated, considering five typical examples from literature. an extensive comparison study with existing approaches based on nyquist plots demonstrate the efficacy of the method presented.

operational_amplifier	this paper presents the development of a wireless flow transmitter using rotameter and operational amplifier based signal conditioning circuit. the rotameter is a linear gravity based flow measuring device. it consists of a display unit which directly displays the flow rate. for industrial applications a new circuitry is required to transmit the measured flow rate to the control unit at remote areas. a ferromagnetic wire attached to the float of rotameter acts as a core of an inductance pickup coil constitutes the flow sensor. the self-inductance of the coil changes according to the change in flow rate. an operational amplifier based circuit is used for the measurement of self-inductance. the voltage corresponding to the flow rate is finally converted into 4-20 ma current. a wireless readout is provided using a microcontroller unit and a bluetooth module. the results show a linear relation between the variation of self-inductance of a pickup coil as well as transmitter output with respect to flow rate. the theoretical equations and the simulation results are added in this paper.
control_engineering	metabolic pathways can be engineered to maximize the synthesis of various products of interest. with the advent of computational systems biology, this endeavour is usually carried out through in silico theoretical studies with the aim to guide and complement further in vitro and in vivo experimental efforts. clearly, what counts is the result in vivo, not only in terms of maximal productivity but also robustness against environmental perturbations. engineering an organism towards an increased production flux, however, often compromises that robustness. in this contribution, we review and investigate how various analytical approaches used in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology are related to concepts developed by systems and control engineering. while trade-offs between production optimality and cellular robustness have already been studied diagnostically and statically, the dynamics also matter. integration of the dynamic design aspects of control engineering with the more diagnostic aspects of metabolic, hierarchical control and regulation analysis is leading to the new, conceptual and operational framework required for the design of robust and productive dynamic pathways.
analog_signal_processing	analog signal processing based radar systems enable reduction in total system power consumption, over conventional digital signal processing based radar systems. in this paper, detection performance degradation of a previously proposed system, based on analog cross-correlation, due to time synchronization is addressed and analog auto-correlation based radar architecture is proposed. by adopting the digital radio frequency memory technique, accurate and tunable delays for autocorrelation process are realized. the probability of detection performance degradation of the previously proposed system, due to mismatch, is evaluated by simulations while varying signal to noise ratios and mismatches at the matched filter. the proposed system 's probability of detection performance will also be simulated versus varying signal to noise ratios, compared to the results of the previously proposed system and analysis of conditions when the proposed system is more beneficial than the previously proposed system will be made.
electric_motor	the expansion of the electric vehicle (ev) market will bring changes in the type of environmental impact generated by the transport sector. this will be partially associated to the introduction of new technologies for energy storage and powertrains, including electric motors technology, which can play a critical role for the ev. to assure its optimal performance, key components and innovative materials are integrated in current motor designs. such is the case of permanent magnets (pm), commonly made of rare-earth elements, which have a history of ecological concerns related to its mining. the goal of the paper is to study novel traction e-motors and to assess the influence of its components, in the environmental performance of the motor and the electric vehicle. in this study, a life cycle assessment (lca) is performed, including the manufacturing, use, and end of life stages of a traction electric motor for ev applications. a comparison is presented, where the rare-earth magnets are replaced by ferrite magnets, under several efficiency scenarios. average european conditions are considered for framing the modeling. a functional unit of 1 km driven by the vehicle is used. twelve impact categories were selected to present the potential environmental impact of the motors. energy consumption during the use stage was identified as a hotspot responsible for an important share of the impact. the amount of energy consumed is highly dependent on the efficiencies of the powertrain, which is why improving efficiency should be regarded as crucial for decreasing the environmental damage produced by the motor. the use of rare-earth magnets during manufacturing does not represent a significant share of the impact, as they only take 2 % of the total mass. other components, including laminations, housing and windings were instead recognized as more significant than the mangets, mainly for climate change, toxicity of humans, soil and water bodies, as well as metal depletion. the use of alternative materials for rare-earth magnets can contribute in the reduction of the potential impact, as long as the overall efficiency of the motor remains the same or increases. based on the study results, it can be concluded that the environmental performance of traction motor is closely tight to its efficiency. selection of materials during design should focus more on preserving or improving the efficiency of the motor, than on materials with low environmental impact during production.

system_identification	the branch of complex system spans over a wide range of areas from physical and technological systems to social and biological systems. as the first step of any complex system analysis, modeling is an important task in scientific studies field. then both the theory and practice of complex system modeling has been considered in recent years. it is well known that system identification is the theory and methods of establishing mathematical models of complex systems. consequently, an identification approach for a class of complex nonlinear system is put forward in this paper. the idea of the identification method employs a system model composed with classical models so as to transform the system structure identification problem into a combinatorial optimization problem initially. then, the artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm is used to synchronously implement the identification on the system 's structure and parameters. finally, in simulation, compared with other algorithm, simulation results show that the proposed scheme is feasible.

state_space_representation	this paper presents research done towards the goal of achieving automatic flight control for commercial airliners in formation flight. the motivation for this research is to ultimately reduce fuel-consumption through a reduction in the drag of the follower aircraft, which is a result of the formation flight. traditional aerodynamic equations for conventional flight of fixed-wing aircraft are expanded to include formation flight interactions. a trim analysis uncovers risks, challenges and feasible trim regions for the formation follower to maintain. these regions include a potentially risky region which is sandwiched between two untrimmable regions, with respect to a maximum aileron setting, and an outside region which has only one untrimmable bound, making it less risky but with lower fuel-consumption benefit. next, a state space representation is constructed, allowing for a linear dynamics analysis. the poles and their movement as a function of the lateral and vertical separation of the follower aircraft relative to the leader aircraft are shown, and indicate greater changes in flight dynamics due to vertical separation than to lateral separation. the results of the trim analysis and linear dynamics analysis form the basis for the design of a formation flight control system.
analog_signal_processing	most forging shops started using natural gas fired furnaces to heat the parts to be forged. with the use of induction heating the parts are heated faster, with more control, semi-automatically, more efficiently, with less decarb and much less scale. induction heating is a much better system to heat billets with less wasted energy. it is possible to use the natural gas to generate electricity and use this electricity to power and operate the induction heating systems. the generating system can range from a few kilowatts to many megawatts with a turbine generating system. we will investigate the cost and payback time for this type of system. with the generation of your own electricity the problem of electrical noise on the electrical line from the induction heating would be eliminated for 3(rd),5(th) and 7(th) harmonics electrical noise. the heat from the generating system can be used for other purposes, this is called cogeneration. the heat could be used to generate steam to run the forging hammers or heat the office buildings or used in an absorption type of cooling system. with fuel cell just around the corner, this will further increase the efficiency of the system and could further reduce the cost.
electricity	this paper presents a novel approach to demand side management (dsm), using an ""individualized"" price policy, where each end user receives a separate electricity pricing scheme designed to incentivize demand management in order to optimally manage flexible demands. these pricing schemes have the objective of reducing the peaks in overall system demand in such a way that the average electricity price each individual user receives is non-discriminatory. it is shown in this paper that this approach has a number of advantages and benefits compared to traditional dsm approaches. the ""demand aware price policy"" approach outlined in this paper exploits the knowledge, or demand-awareness, obtained from advanced metering infrastructure. the presented analysis includes a detailed case study of an existing european distribution network where dsm trial data was available from the residential end-users.
pid_controller	this paper uses a particle swarm optimization (pso) algorithm, an adaptive weighted pso (awpso) algorithm, and a genetic algorithm (ga) to determine the optimal proportional-integral-derivative controller 's parameters of a hydraulic position control system. a typical hydraulic servo system has been selected as an application. the mathematical model of this hydraulic servo system which comprises the most relevant dynamics and nonlinear effects is considered. the model simulates the behavior of a rexroth servo valve and includes the nonlinearities of friction forces, valve dynamics, oil compressibility, and load influence. the performance indices, which have been used in the optimization process, are integral absolute error, integral square error and integral time absolute error. the proposed controller is implemented on the simulation model to identify the best method for tuning the controller. compared with ga and awpso results, the pso method has been found to be more efficient and robust in improving the step response of a position control for hydraulic systems in terms of settling time, maximum overshoot and undershoot.
operational_amplifier	temperature is one of the basic biophysical quantity monitored for various biomedical systems. moreover, the variation of temperature is also an important parameter which can be used for estimating other measurands, such as respiratory airflow. this paper proposes a simple operational amplifier-based astable multivibrator circuit for linearization of the characteristic of a negative temperature coefficient thermistor constituting one of the timing resistors. the circuit has been combined with a lookup table to get the unknown temperature value from multivibrator output. moreover, the same system topology can be used as a linearizer for measurement of respiratory airflow. the performance of the composite system has been verified experimentally. a linearity of approximately +/- 0.75% has been achieved over 30 degrees c-110 degrees c in the case of temperature measurement and +/- 1.2% for airflow of 10-60 lpm. better results can also be achieved with the introduction of interpolation algorithms, but at a higher computational and component cost. the compactness of the complete system makes it a good candidate for embedded sensing applications in biomedical systems, such as point-of-care monitoring or in sleep study.

system_identification	a fuzzy algorithm, the takagi-sugeno model, is implemented to develop a fuzzy inference system for predicting the holding capacity of suction caisson foundations for offshore platforms. the premise parameters of the fuzzy model are optimized by using a subtractive clustering algorithm. the consequent parameters are optimally determined via a weighted least square estimation. the input variables used for training the fuzzy model include the aspect ratio of the caisson, the undrained shear strength of the clay, and the angle that the chain force forms with the horizontal. the output of the proposed fuzzy model is the capacity of the suction caisson anchor. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fuzzy modeling framework, the results of extensive finite element analyses are investigated. comparisons of the trained fuzzy model with the data demonstrate that the proposed modeling framework is an effective method to estimate the holding capacity of offshore suction caisson systems. moreover, the performance of the fuzzy model is robust against higher levels of input data uncertainties. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
electricity	demand response (dr) is a recent effort to improve the efficiency of the electricity market and the stability of the power system. a successful implementation relies on both appropriate policy design and enabling technology. this paper presents a multiagent system to evaluate optimal residential dr implementation in a distribution network, in which the main stakeholders are modeled by heterogeneous home agents (has) and a retailer agent (ra). the ha is able to predict and control electricity load demand. a real-time price prediction model is developed for the ha and the ra. the optimal control of electricity consumption is formulated into a convex programming problem to minimize electricity payment and waiting time under real-time pricing. simulation results show that the peak-to-average power ratio and electricity payments are significantly reduced using the proposed algorithms. the ha, with the proposed optimal control algorithms, can be embedded into a home energy management system to make intelligent decisions on behalf of homeowners responding to dr policies. the proposed agent system can be utilized to evaluate various strategies and emerging technologies that enable the implementation of dr.
analog_signal_processing	this paper describes a dual-stroke acting hydraulic power take-off (pto) system employed in the wave energy converter (wec) with an inverse pendulum. the hydraulic pto converts slow irregular reciprocating wave motions to relatively smooth, fast rotation of an electrical generator. the design of the hydraulic pto system and its control are critical to maximize the generated power. a time domain simulation study and the laboratory experiment of the full-scale beach test are presented. the results of the simulation and laboratory experiments including their comparison at full-scale are also presented, which have validated the rationality of the design and the reliability of some key components of the prototype of the wec with an inverse pendulum with the dual-stroke acting hydraulic pto system.
state_space_representation	this paper presents modeling, design and analysis of a bidirectional half-bridge dc/dc converter suitable for power electronic interface between the main energy storage system and the electric traction drive in hybrid electric vehicles. a hybrid energy storage system composed of a battery unit and an ultracapacitor pack is considered. a parallel dc-linked multi-input converter with a half-bridge bidirectional dc/dc cell topology is chosen to link the battery/ultracapacitor storage unit with the dc-link. the paper focuses on modeling the proposed converter for both dynamic and steady state analysis. averaging and linearization techniques are applied to obtain the averaged state space models and small signal models of the converter in both boost and buck operation modes. a criterion for sizing the converter passive components based on the imposed design specifications and constraints is illustrated. simulation results of the buck-boost converter during normal functioning and under faulty conditions are presented. in particular, short-circuit faults and open-circuit faults of diodes and transistors are analyzed.

digital_control	phase-shift modulation (psm) is a commonly used technique for controlling the active power flow in resonant dc-ac and dc-dc converters. although traditionally developed as an analog modulation scheme, psm is being increasingly implemented digitally in conjunction with advanced multivariable digital controllers and online efficiency optimization algorithms. while analog psm is known not to introduce additional dynamics from a small-signal standpoint, the analysis disclosed in this study indicates that discrete-time, or uniformly sampled, psm introduces a transport delay of small-signal nature. furthermore, and in close analogy with the theory of uniformly sampled pulse width modulators, such delay depends on the modulator carrier type as well as on the converter operating point. this paper first clarifies the modeling procedure for describing the small-signal dynamics of uniformly sampled phase-shift modulators. second, it provides an extension of the traditional phasor modeling to digital phase-controlled converters, allowing to account for the additional modulator dynamics in the design of the closed-loop compensation. theoretical findings are validated via simulation and experimental results.
digital_control	with the advances of stem cell research, development of intelligent biomaterials and three-dimensional biofabrication strategies, highly mimicked tissue or organs can be engineered. among all the biofabrication approaches, bioprinting based on inkjet printing technology has the promises to deliver and create biomimicked tissue with high throughput, digital control, and the capacity of single cell manipulation. therefore, this enabling technology has great potential in regenerative medicine and translational applications. the most current advances in organ and tissue bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in this review, including vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. in addition, the benign side effect of bioprinting to the printed mammalian cells can be utilized for gene or drug delivery, which can be achieved conveniently during precise cell placement for tissue construction. with layer-by-layer assembly, three-dimensional tissues with complex structures can be printed using converted medical images. therefore, bioprinting based on thermal inkjet is so far the most optimal solution to engineer vascular system to the thick and complex tissues. collectively, bioprinting has great potential and broad applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. the future advances of bioprinting include the integration of different printing mechanisms to engineer biphasic or triphasic tissues with optimized scaffolds and further understanding of stem cell biology.
electrical_network	a promising development in the design of datacenters is the hybrid network architecture consisting of both optical and electrical elements, in which end-to-end traffic can be routed through either an electrical path or an optical path. the core optical switch is used to dynamically create optical paths between pairs of electrical edge-switches in such a datacenter network. in this context, the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and vm-placement poses new and different challenges not addressed yet in hybrid datacenter. in particular, we foresee two issues: (i) the number of edge-switches that can be simultaneously reached using optical paths from an edge-switch is limited by the size of the optical switch, (ii) the dynamic creation of optical paths can potentially establish a constrained optical network topology leading to poor performance. in this work, we abstract the requests of tenants as virtual networks, and study the problem of embedding virtual networks on a hybrid datacenter. we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem and analyze its complexity. we develop and analyse three algorithms for embedding dynamically arriving virtual network demands on a hybrid optical-electrical datacenter. through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of not only exploiting the already established optical paths, but also of using electrical network in embedding requests of virtual networks.

operational_amplifier	this paper presents a new family of class-ab operational transconductance amplifier (ota) circuits based on single-stage topologies with non-linear current amplifiers. the proposed variable-mirror amplifier (vma) architecture is mainly characterized by generating all class-ab current in the output transistors only, by exhibiting very low sensitivity to both technology and temperature deviations, and by avoiding the need for any internal frequency-compensation mechanism. hence, this family of otas is well-suited for low-power switched-capacitor circuits and specifically optimized for switched-opamp fast on-off operation and multi-decade load-capacitance specifications. analytical expressions valid in all regions of operation are presented to minimize vma settling time in discrete-time circuits. also, a complete ota design example integrated in 0.18 mu m 1p6m mim 1.8 v cmos technology is supplied with detailed simulation and experimental results. compared to resistor-free state-of-art class-ab opamp and ota literature, the proposed architecture returns the highest measured figure-of-merit value.
analog_signal_processing	a preamplifier based on the source-follower direct injection (sfdi) topology for use in read-out integrated circuits (roic) of quantum-well infrared photodetectors focal plane arrays (qwip-fpa) is demonstrated. the fabricated circuit shows high linearity, high integration time (from hundreds of mu s to few ms) and low current detection capabilities for a wide range of input current (order of few pa). this performance was achieved through the use of a poly1-poly2 capacitor that, although presenting some penalties in area consumption, provides a higher linearity, lower leakage current and higher temperature stability than all others capacitors found in literature. secondary effects such as charge injection and clock feed-through are observed in the experimental results and classical techniques, like the use of dummy transistor, are shown to be effective in minimizing these effects and maximizing the linearity of the response. the overall results indicate that this circuit architecture has a great potential to be practically integrated in larger qwip-fpa roics, showing an improved performance relating to previous works in literature.
electric_motor	this paper proposes a new operation and control strategy for power-assisted wheelchairs (paw) using one brushless dc (bldc) motor. the conventional electrical wheelchairs are too heavy and large for one person to move because they have two electric motor wheels. on the other hand, the proposed paw system has a small volume and is easy to move due to the presence of a single wheel motor. unlike the conventional electric wheelchairs, this structure for a paw does not have a control joystick to reduce its weight and volume. to control the wheelchair without a joystick, a special control system and algorithm are needed for proper operation of the wheelchair. in the proposed paw system uses only one sensor to detect the acceleration and direction of paw 's movement. by using this sensor, speed control can be achieved. with a speed control system, there are three kinds of operations that can be done on the speed of a paw: the increment of paw speed by summing external force, the decrement of paw speed by subtracting external force, and emergency breaking by evaluating the time duration of external force. the validity of the proposed algorithm is verified through experimental results.
state_space_representation	this paper develops a novel approach for estimating latent state variables of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dsge) models that are solved using a second-order accurate approximation. i apply the kalman filter to a state-space representation of the second-order solution based on the 'pruning' scheme of kim et al. (j econ dyn control 32:3397-3414, 2008). by contrast to particle filters, no stochastic simulations are needed for the deterministic filter here; the present method is thus much faster; in terms of estimation accuracy for latent states it is competitive with the standard particle filter. use of the pruning scheme distinguishes the filter here from the deterministic quadratic kalman filter presented by ivashchenko (comput econ, 43:71-82, 2014). the filter here performs well even in models with big shocks and high curvature.
analog_signal_processing	this paper presents a smart sensory platform based on field programmable analog array (fpaa) to support a wide variety of mems sensors applications. a discrete-time (dt) and continuous-time (ct) dual-mode fpaa is proposed to improve the analog signal conditioning flexibility. a gain-programmable low-noise multi-mode sensor readout circuit (roc) is designed for versatile sensor weak signal acquisition, which can sense capacitive, voltage or current signal. a microcontroller (mcu) and a 12-bit sar adc are used for digital signal processing and analog-digital conversion. the platform is implemented in 0.18 mu m m cmos process. the multi-mode sensor readout circuit achieves an input referred noise of 140nv/hz, 200pa/hz and 5af/hz for voltage, current and capacitive signal readout mode, respectively. analog signal processing functions, such as ct pga, dt filter, ct adder and comparator, are realized through the configuration of the dual-mode fpaa. the sar adc shows 10.2bit effective number of bits with 450 mu a power consumption at 1msps sampling rate.
system_identification	there has been little full-scale physical experimentation to support the findings of numerous computational studies regarding the contribution of various substructure components to overall bridge-foundation system behavior. in response to this lack of experimental data, a field testing program was undertaken to investigate the in situ dynamic characteristics of a 27-m-long, three-span, precast-concrete bridge. forced vibration testing and system identification were used to characterize the dominant modal behavior of the bridge-foundation system in each loading direction, leading to identification of the likely force-transfer mechanisms between the structure and the substructure components. it was determined that both the transverse and longitudinal responses of the bridge were dominated by the abutment stiffness, with the passive resistance of the buried settlement slab contributing significantly to the transverse response and the backfill passive resistance dominating the longitudinal response.
electrical_network	the resistance distance between any two vertices of a connected graph is defined as the effective resistance between them in the electrical network constructed from the graph by replacing each edge with a unit resistor. the kirchhoff index of a graph is defined as the sum of all the resistance distances between any pair of vertices of the graph. let g = h[g(1), g(2),., g(k)] be the generalised join graph of g(1), g(2), ..., g(k) determined by h. in this paper, we first give formulae for resistance distances and kirchhoff index of g in terms of parameters of g(i) 's and h. then, we show that computing resistance distances and kirchhoff index of g can be decomposed into simpler ones. finally, we obtain explicit formulae for resistance distances and kirchhoff index of g when g(i) 's and h take some special graphs, such as the complete graph, the path, and the cycle.
analog_signal_processing	floating oscillating-bodies constitute an important class of offshore wave energy converters. the testing of their power take-off equipment (pto) (high-pressure hydraulics, linear electrical generator or other) under realistically simulated sea conditions is usually regarded as a major task. a laboratory rig, consisting of a u-tube enclosing an oscillating column of water driven by a time-varying air-pressure, was devised to simulate the hydrodynamics of an oscillating buoy absorbing energy from sea waves, especially the inertia and the resonant frequency of the oscillating body. the pto force is applied (by means of a piston) on one of the ends of the u-tube oscillating water column, whereas the other end is subject to a controlled time-varying air pressure. this is found to provide a reasonably realistic way of testing the pto system (including its control) at an adequate scale (say about 1:5 to 1:4), which would avoid the use of a much more expensive experimental facility (very large wave tank) or testing in real wind-generated sea-waves. the matching conditions that the u-tube geometry and the driving time-varying air pressure must meet to ensure an adequate simulation are derived. these conditions leave some freedom to the u-tube rig designer and operator, allowing practical and engineering issues to be taken into account.

pid_controller	the aim of this paper is to propose a low cost, automated furnace control system for the heat treatment of steel. we used an open source electronic prototyping platform to control the furnace temperature, thus reducing human interaction during the heat process. the platform can be adapted to non-controlled commercial furnaces, which are often used by small businesses. a proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller was implemented to regulate the furnace temperature based on a defined heat treatment cycle. the embedded system activates the furnace resistors through pulse width modulation (pwm), allowing for control of electrical power supplied to the furnace. hardening and tempering were performed on standard steel samples using a traditional method (visual inspection without temperature control) as well the embedded system with pid feedback control. the results show that the proposed system can reproduce an arbitrary heat treatment curve with accuracy and provide the desired final hardness as inferred through metallographic analysis. in addition, we observed a 6% saving in energy consumption using the proposed control system. furthermore, the estimated cost to implement the system is 42% lower than a commercial controller model implemented in commercial furnaces.

signal-flow_graph	a fast three-dimensional discrete cosine transform algorithm (3d fct) and a fast 3d inverse cosine transform (3d ifct) algorithm are presented, suitable for analysis of 3d data points. many existing algorithms for three-dimensional data points make use of either the 1d cosine transform or both the 2d and 1d cosine transforms. existing algorithms based on the 1d discrete cosine transform (dct) apply the separable 1d transform to the data points in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, while those based on 2d and 1d transforms apply the 2d cosine transform for the x-y planes and then the 1d cosine transform in the z direction. the proposed 3d dct algorithms handle the 3d data points directly and have been shown to be computationally efficient. they involve a 3d decomposition process where a data volume is recursively decomposed in each dimension until unit data cubes are obtained. the algorithms are presented in the form of a signal flow graph which captures the various computations involved. a complexity analysis along with empirical results is included, demonstrating the performance of the proposed direct 3d dct algorithms. as 3d fct and ifct are symmetric and relatively fast, they can be used in any application requiring a real-time symmetric codec, such as video conferencing, online multiparty video games, and three-dimensional graphics rendering.

control_engineering	the optimal control of fractional-order active isolation system is researched based on the optimal control theory, and the effect of fractional-order derivative on passive isolation system is also analyzed. the mechanical model is established where viscoelastic features of isolation materials are described by fractional-order derivative. the viscoelastic property of the fractional-order derivative in dynamical system is studied and the fractional-order derivative could be divided into linear stiffness and linear damping. it is found that both the fractional coefficient and the fractional order could affect not only the resonance amplitude through the equivalent linear damping coefficient but also the resonance frequency by the equivalent linear stiffness. based on optimal control theory, the feedback gain of fractional-order active isolation system under harmonic excitation is obtained, which is changed with the excitation frequency. the statistical responses of the displacement and velocity for passive and active vibration isolation systems subjected to random excitation are also presented, which further verifies the excellent performance of fractional-order derivative in vibration control engineering.

microcontroller	a new device for continuous measurement of fruit or stem growth on the basis of an optoelectronic reflex sensor and a microcontroller board was developed and successfully tested under open field conditions. the principle of the system is based on the detection of alternating narrow white and blacks bars printed on a flexible tape, which is tightened as a loop around the measured object and slides under an infrared reflex sensor in response to the object 's radial growth. the design of this new sensor allows continuous, long term measurements without the need of periodic maintenance or physical adjustments of the measurement device. the new system measures changes of fruit or stem perimeter rather than diameter, thus yielding a more relevant information about the growth of objects which are intrinsically not of perfectly circular cross-sectional shape. the described sensor is very lightweight and does not require any mechanical frame or support structure. the tested prototypes had a measurement resolution of 0.5 mm of perimeter, corresponding to a resolution of about 0.16 mm of diameter for a spherical object. the cost of the sensor is very modest, as it consists of only few and inexpensive components.

electrical_circuits	the observability of a system with respect to its possible outputs is usually evaluated using the rank criterion of the observability matrix or the observability indices. in addition, this paper uses the properties of the differential equations characterizing real-time electrical circuits which base their nonlinearities on the exponential function. interplay between mathematical tools and practical considerations is done through observability coefficients, observability matrices and high order sliding mode observers for the colpitts chaotic system, representative for such nonlinearities.
analog_signal_processing	this paper presents an extension to the classical gradient-based extremum seeking control for the case when the disturbances responsible for changes in the extremum of a selected performance function are available for measurement. based on these additional measurements, an adaptive extremum seeking disturbance feedforward is designed that approximates the unknown, static mapping between the disturbances and the optimal inputs. for this purpose, orthogonal, multivariate tchebyshev polynomials are used. the feedforward enables the extremum seeking to be conducted in the proximity of the extremum thus yielding improvements both in terms of accuracy and increased convergence speed compared to the traditional scheme. simulation results given for a turbine driven electrical generator system demonstrate the benefits of the presented design.
pid_controller	study on rotary valve system (rvs) for automotive engines has been carried out over many years. recent researches have already successfully implemented the idea, but none of design can provide variable valve timing and flow area control simultaneously. therefore, a rvs with variable valve control system is proposed in this paper. the system design and dynamic analysis of the proposed rvs are first presented. moreover, the selection of the proportional, integral and derivative (pid) controller parameters for the valve control based on an emerging artificial intelligent technique, cuckoo search (cs), is also discussed. experimental and simulation results show that the proposed tuning method is better than the traditional ziegler and nichols method, and the proposed variable rotary valve control system is feasible.
analog_signal_processing	the paper presents a simple transresistor attractive for on-chip analog-signal-processing. the proposed circuit offers not only a quite good linearity of dc transfer characteristic but, first of all, a relatively low value of its output resistance. this enables a voltage mode operation even if our circuit is loaded by a not necessarily very high resistor. the obtained rather low value of output resistance in our circuit is due to adding to the transresistor-input-stage a simple rail-to-rail voltage follower. to the author 's knowledge, the proposed solution is original and not published yet in the literature. input stage of the transresistor is built of only 4 mos transistors and creates a simple quasi-linear current-to-voltage convertor. output stage of it is built of 9 mos transistors, plays a role of a very precise and simple rail-to-rail cmos-pair-based nonstandard voltage follower. in respect of simplicity and headroom, our follower is better than conventional oa-based voltage followers. preliminary simulation results are in a good agreement with the theory presented.
state_space_representation	the paper presents a control-oriented modeling approach for multi-zone buildings with mixed-mode cooling, based on the linear state-space representation with varying coefficient matrices. key features are the time-variant thermal resistances, associated with the heat extraction due to airflow, calculated using an airflow network model. this approach was validated with experimental data collected in a two-zone test-building under four operation modes. a forward linear time-variant state-space (ltv-ss) model, developed based on first principles, was then used as a true representation of the building, to identify the parameters of a low-order ltv-ss gray-box model. the low-order model can predict the building thermal dynamics with sufficient accuracy with a root mean square error (rmse) of 0.58 degrees c for the air and 1.08 degrees c for the area-weighted mean surface temperature in the south direct gain zone. furthermore, the study develops a progressive refinement (prore) optimization method, following the multi-level optimization topology and branch and bound decision trimming strategy, to find sequences of binary (open/close) decisions for the motorized windows. due to the significant improvement in computing time, the models and algorithms presented in this paper enable long-term simulation for mpc performance evaluation and implementation of predictive strategies in real controllers.

electricity	the term smart grid refers to a modernization of the electrical network consisting in the integration of various technologies such as dispersed generation, dispatchable loads, communication systems and storage devices which operates in grid-connected and islanded modes. as a result, traditional optimization techniques in new power systems have been seriously influenced during the last decade. one of the most important technical and economical tools in this regard is the optimal power flow (opf). as a fundamental optimization tool in the operation and planning fields, opf has an undeniable role in the power system. this paper reviews and compares the opf approaches mainly related to smart distribution grids. in this work, the main opf approaches are compared in terms of their objective functions, constraints, and methodologies. furthermore, computational performances, case study networks and the publication date of these methods are reported. finally, some basic challenges arising from the new opf methodologies in smart grids are addressed.
operational_amplifier	negative feedback technique employing high dc gain operational amplifier (op-amp) is one of the most important techniques in analog circuit design. however, high dc gain op-amp is difficult to realize in scaled technology due to a decrease of intrinsic gain. in this paper, high dc gain op-amp using common-gate topology with high power efficiency is proposed. to achieve high dc gain, large output impedance is required but input transistors' drain conductance decreases output impedance of conventional topology such as folded cascode topology with complementary input. this is because bias current of the output side transistors is not separated from the bias current of the input transistors. on the other hand, proposed circuit can suppress a degradation of output impedance by inserting common-gate topology between input and output side. this architecture separates bias current of the input transistors from that of the output side, and hence the effect of the drain conductance of input transistors is reduced. as the result, proposed circuit can increase dc gain about 10 db compared with the folded cascode topology with complementary input in 65 nm cmos process. moreover, power consumption can be reduced because input nmos and pmos share bias current. according to the simulation results, for the same power consumption, in the proposed circuit gain-bandwidth product (gbw) is improved by approximately 30% and noise is also reduced in comparison to the conventional topology.
signal-flow_graph	traditional design for testability (dft) is arduous and time-consuming because of the iterative process of testability assessment and design modification. to improve the dft efficiency, a dft process based on test point allocation is proposed. in this process, the set of optimal test points will be automatically allocated according to the signal reachability under the constraints of testability criteria. thus, the iterative dft process will be completed by computer and the test engineers will be released to concentrate on the system design rather than the repetitive modification process. to perform test point allocation, the dependency matrix of signal to potential test point (sp-matrix) is defined based on multi-signal flow graph. then, genetic algorithm (ga) is adopted to search for the optimal test point allocation solution based on the sp-matrix. at last, experiment is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

digital_control	this paper presents a three-dimensional (3-d) space vector pulse width modulation (svpwm) technique via a 4 x 4 orthonormal transformation matrix that has been used as a new approach in controlling a three-phase four-leg voltage source inverter (vsi). a fully optimal digital control scheme for the closed-loop regulation of the three-phase four-leg vsi has been used to synthesize a sinusoidal waveform with the help of the proposed method. discrete-time modelling of each phase has been obtained independently in abc reference frame, and its optimal controller has been designed using a predefined performance index. a dsp-based controlled three-phase four-leg prototype vsi has been designed to verify the proposed discrete time modelling and the control scheme. the simulations and the real-time experiments show that satisfactory results have been obtained for the modelling of the three-phase four-leg vsi in abc reference frame and the 3-d svpwm technique via 4 x 4 orthonormal transformation matrix at 20 khz switching frequency.
digital_control	in grid-connected converter control, grid voltage feedforward is usually introduced to suppress the influence of grid voltage distortion on the converter 's grid-side ac current. however, owing to the time-delay in control systems, the suppression effect of the grid voltage distortion is seriously affected. in this paper, the positive effects of the grid voltage feedforward control are analyzed in detail, and the time-delay caused by the low-pass filter (lpf) in the voltage filtering circuits and digital control are summarized. in order to reduce the time-delay effect on the performance of the feedforward control, a voltage feedforward control strategy with time-delay compensation is proposed, in which, a leading correction of the feedforward voltage is used. the optimal leading step used in this strategy is derived from analyzing the phase-frequency characteristics of a lpf and the implementation of digital control. by using the optimal leading step, the delay in the feedforward path can be further counteracted so that the performance of the feedforward control in terms of suppressing the influence of grid voltage distortion on the converter output current can be improved. the validity of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experiment results.
electrical_network	isolated electrical systems lack electrical interconnection to other networks and are usually placed in geographically isolated areas-mainly islands or locations in developing countries. until recently, only diesel generators were able to assure a safe and reliable supply in exchange for very high costs for fuel transportation and system operation. transmission system operators (tsos) are increasingly seeking to replace traditional energy models based on large groups of conventional generation units with mixed solutions where diesel groups are held as backup generation and important advantages are provided by renewable energy sources. the grid codes determine the technical requirements to be fulfilled by the generators connected in any electrical network, but regulations applied to isolated grids are more demanding. in technical literature it is rather easy to find and compare grid codes for interconnected electrical systems. however, the existing literature is incomplete and sparse regarding isolated grids. this paper aims to review the current state of isolated systems and grid codes applicable to them, specifying points of comparison and defining the guidelines to be followed by the upcoming regulations.
system_identification	a novel adaptive filter combining the affine projection algorithm (apa) and the affine projection sign algorithm (apsa) is proposed using an impulsive noise indicator. this indicator is proposed to use the apa as the component filter in impulsive noise environments, and it is easily obtained with convex combination schemes. from this, the proposed algorithm achieves robustness against impulsive noise regardless of the convergence state. in addition, the proposed algorithm exhibits a fast convergence rate of the apa for various noise environments. simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm adequately combines the advantages of the two component filters for system identification scenarios.

pid_controller	this paper focuses on the quality improvements on clinching joints using a servo press with a radial basis function neural network and a sliding mode (rbfs) control strategy. bottom thickness, which is affected by the press punch position, is usually used to monitor clinching joint quality. traditional clinching presses are driven by pneumatic pistons or motors that provide feedback on punch force or motor position. however, this feedback is indirectly related to the joint bottom thickness. clinching workers who set the control parameters on these presses depend on tests and statistics. thus, this paper presents a servo press system that utilizes punch position feedback to directly control the joint bottom thickness. transmission errors are considered for the movement accuracy of the servo press. a mathematical model of the servo press is established for analyzing. an algorithm, which combines rbf neural network and sliding mode, is proposed and applied for press position tracking. this algorithm adopts an rbf neural network to approximate the nominal model of the press system. the update law of the algorithm is based on the lyapunov function used to prove the stability of a closed-loop system. the sliding mode controller compensates for the neural network error and disturbance. finally, experiments are executed on the servo press with an rbfs controller. to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a fuzzy pid controller is also applied to the press for comparison. the results indicate that the servo clinching press system with rbfs efficiently and accurately control the clinching jointing process.

control_engineering	complex dynamic engineering systems i.e. radar, gimbal, missile, infrared sensors, land vehicles, aircraft, ships, power plants become challenges for classical fault diagnostic system. they are modular consisting of modules or line replaceable units (lru). each module has its own bit circuit that is linked with the system level bit through the bit architecture. the performance characteristic of the diagnostic system i.e. sensitivity and specificity is usually poor. fault diagnostic for these systems are plagued with conditions known as false alarm (fa), missed detection, cannot duplicate (cnd) and retest ok (rtok) that have adverse impacts in performance, reliability, maintainability, availability, safety and affordability. these costly elusive problems may be due to many reasons; some of them are: absence or lack of fault modeling during the threshold design, absence or lack of test verticality, unobservable and uncontrollable modes of state variables in the system state space model. where do signal detection theory techniques (sdtt) fit in the general scheme of classical fault diagnostic i.e. bit threshold design? signal detection theory models lend themselves readily to numerical computations suitable for solution on a computer that is applicable to classical bit testability threshold design. nevertheless, several mathematical strategies must be used before one can apply sdtt into bit detection. since sdtt has been very reliable in many fields, in radar detection application, in medicine diagnostic tests, in biometrics, it can as well be a valuable tool in bit threshold design with a few mathematical manipulations. this paper presents the foundations of sdtt in radar target detection theory in a coherent manner easy to follow and in a way to advance the bit diagnostic threshold design while at the same time emphasizes the underlying physics. these techniques make use of gaussian distribution and bayesian statistics. some of the most important performance measures are sensitivity, specificity, prevalence. this paper addresses as well the test verticality issue and will introduce the unobservable and uncontrollable state variable issues. however, state observability and state controllability are beyond the scope of this paper and should be fully addressed in a control engineering model-based fault diagnostic research task.
electricity	salinity gradient solar ponds act as an integrated thermal solar energy collector and storage system. the temperature difference between the upper convective zone and the lower convective zone of a salinity gradient solar pond can be in the range of 40-60a degrees c. the temperature at the bottom of the pond can reach up to 90a degrees c. low-grade heat (< 100a degrees c) from solar ponds is currently converted into electricity by organic rankine cycle engines. thermoelectric generators can operate at very low temperature differences and can be a good candidate to replace organic rankine cycle engines for power generation from salinity gradient solar ponds. the temperature difference in a solar pond can be used to power thermoelectric generators for electricity production. this paper presents an experimental investigation of a thermoelectric generators heat exchanger system designed to be powered by the hot water from the lower convective zone of a solar pond, and cold water from the upper convective zone of a solar pond. the results obtained have indicated significant prospects of such a system to generate power from low-grade heat for remote area power supply systems.

electric_motor	this paper presents the personalized satellite radio, a novel satellite-based radio concept, capable of providing radio services to vehicular terminals. this paper describes the technical solution proposed, which overcomes the classical streaming approach used for traditional radio. the main concept behind it is that individual audio and multimedia files are broadcast to the mobile users instead of transmitting a number of continuous streams. the received files are stored in a large cache located in the receiver of each mobile terminal and are sequentially played to generate a service similar to traditional radio/entertainment programmes. the resulting file-based radio approach makes, in particular, use of higher-layer coding at the transport layer and smart techniques to build up an audible programme with no interruptions and full audio quality based oil the available files. this paper also presents the results of extensive trials that were conducted with a system prototype developed in the framework of an european space agency funded project. copyright (c) 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.
state_space_representation	although there are many successful applications of neural networks (nns), however, there are still some drawbacks in using neural networks (nns) in any control scheme. in this study an nn-based model is applied for a tension leg platform (tlp) system. a linear differential inclusion (ldi) state-space representation is constructed to represent the dynamics of the nn model. control performance is achieved by using the parallel distributed compensation (pdc) scheme to ensure the stability of tlp systems subjected to an external wave force. in terms of the stability analysis, the linear matrix inequality (lmi) conditions are derived using the lyapunov theory to guarantee the robustness design and stability of the tlp system. a simulation example based on practical data is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed fuzzy control approach. in the end, we discuss a practical application with field data on the wave properties and structural characteristics. the results indicate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed nn based approach.

system_identification	attempts are being made to improve mechanical design by using nonlinearity rather than eliminating it, especially in the area of vibration control and in energy harvesting. in such systems, there is a need to both predict the dynamic behavior and to estimate the system properties from measurements. this paper concerns an experimental investigation of a simple identification method, which is specific to systems in which the behavior is known to be similar to that of a duffing-type system. it involves the measurement of jump-down frequencies and the amplitudes of displacement at these frequencies. the theoretical basis for the method is briefly described as, is an experimental investigation on a beam-shaker system. the results are comparable with those determined by the restoring force surface method. the method described in this article has the advantage that the data can be collected and processed more easily than the restoring force surface method and can be potentially more suitable for the engineering community than existing identification measures.
electricity	residential domestic hot water energy consumption represented 16% of the eu household heating demand in 2013. with the improvement of the building insulation envelope, domestic hot water contribution to energy consumption is expected to increase significantly, with values between 20% and 32% in single family buildings, and between 35% to almost 50% in multifamily buildings. this energy, currently lost to the environment, can be recovered by waste water heat recovery systems inside buildings (in building solutions). while most publications in this field focus on shower heat recovery and on waste water as heat source for heat pumps, the detailed impact of waste water heat recovery at a city scale by aggregating building data has not been addressed yet. furthermore, waste water heat recovery potential and relevance was not yet quantified as a function of the specific inhabitant and household numbers, end-use occurrence, and building type and age. a method to quantify the building-specific energy cost and energy saving potentials, based on pinch analysis, at the urban scale of in-building waste water heat recovery systems is therefore proposed. a complementary method to spatially allocate and characterise grey water streams as to thermal load and temperature levels in function of the building specificities is also developed. these methods are applied in two case studies, first as retrofitting solution in a city in luxembourg and, second, as optimisation measure for high efficiency residential buildings. grey water heat recovery would reduce the residential fuel consumption of the city by 63%. an integrated approach combining grey water heat recovery for hot water preheating and a heat pump yields up to 28% and 41% electricity savings for passive single family houses and multifamily buildings, respectively. with the detailed characterisation of various grey water streams as a function of inhabitant number and end -use occurrence, the quantification of the energy savings and costs through heat recovery is improved. the outcomes of urban energy and cost assessments concerning grey water heat recovery are more specific, as the results at building level are aggregated to the considered geographical scope. the proposed method therefore complements current urban energy and cost assessments with the detailed integration of in -building grey water heat recovery systems.

pid_controller	this study investigates the application of the sliding mode controller (smc) for induction motor drive variable-displacement pressure-compensated pump (vdpc) system powered by an isolated wind/storage unit. the variable-speed wind turbine (wt) is proposed to drive a permanent magnet synchronous generator (pmsg) which, feeds a storing energy unit and stand-alone dynamic load. energy storage systems are required for power balance quality in isolated wind power systems. initially, the holistic model of the entire system is achieved, including the pmsg, the uncontrolled rectifier, the buck converter, the storage system, induction machine and the vdpc pump. the power absorbed by the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed wt and energy storage systems, subject to sliding mode control. the main purposes are to supply 220 v/50 hz through a three-phase inverter and adjust the im speed and vdpc pump flow rate. the performance of the proposed system is compared with the neural network control and the conventional pid control. the simulation results show that the proposed system with the smc and neural network controllers has good performance and good prediction of the electrical parameter waveforms compared with the case of the conventional pid controller.
electric_motor	an x17.2 solar flare occurred on 2003 october 28, accompanied by multi-wavelength emissions and a high flux of relativistic particles observed at 1 au. we present the analytic results of the trace, soho, rhessi, ace, goes, hard x-ray (integral satellite), radio (onderejov radio telescope), and neutron monitor data. it is found that the inferred magnetic reconnection electric field correlates well with the hard x-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron emission at the sun. thus the flare 's magnetic reconnection probably makes a crucial contribution to the prompt relativistic particles, which could be detected at 1 au. since the neutrons were emitted a few minutes before the injection of protons and electrons, we propose a magnetic-field evolution configuration to explain this delay. we do not exclude the effect of cme-driven shock, which probably plays an important role in the delayed gradual phase of solar energetic particles.

electric_motor	a power operated detrasher was developed for removal of green top as well as dry trash from the harvested sugarcane stalks. it consisted of mechanisms for cane feeding, detrashing and delivery. it separates the top from the cane by breaking it from the natural weak point at the joint of immature top with mature cane stalks. it can be transported on three point linkage of the tractor and operated by an electric motor, diesel engine or tractor pto. performance of the equipment was evaluated by feeding different varieties of harvested canes, with their tops first, to the detrashing rollers through the feeding chute. the trash left on the cane after passing through the detrasher varied from 1.5 to 6.6 %. trash removal efficiency varied from 77.5 to 94.5 % depending upon the variety. the output of the detrasher was 2.4 t/h. there was a saving of about 17 % in cost of operation and 84 % in labour requirement using the detrasher as compared to manual method.
pid_controller	for decades, pid (proportional + integral + derivative)-like controllers have been successfully used in academia and industry for many kinds of plants. this is thanks to its simplicity and suitable performance in linear or linearized plants, and under certain conditions, in nonlinear ones. a number of pid controller gains tuning approaches have been proposed in the literature in the last decades; most of them off-line techniques. however, in those cases wherein plants are subject to continuous parametric changes or external disturbances, online gains tuning is a desirable choice. this is the case of modular underwater rovs (remotely operated vehicles) where parameters (weight, buoyancy, added mass, among others) change according to the tool it is fitted with. in practice, some amount of time is dedicated to tune the pid gains of a rov. once the best set of gains has been achieved the rov is ready to work. however, when the vehicle changes its tool or it is subject to ocean currents, its performance deteriorates since the fixed set of gains is no longer valid for the new conditions. thus, an online pid gains tuning algorithm should be implemented to overcome this problem. in this paper, an auto-tune pid-like controller based on neural networks (nn) is proposed. the nn plays the role of automatically estimating the suitable set of pid gains that achieves stability of the system. the nn adjusts online the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error. simulation results are given considering an underactuated 6 dof (degrees of freedom) underwater rov. real time experiments on an underactuated mini rov are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
pid_controller	an improved proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller based on predictive functional control (pfc) is proposed and tested on the chamber pressure in an industrial coke furnace. the proposed design is motivated by the fact that pid controllers for industrial processes with time delay may not achieve the desired control performance because of the unavoidable model/plant mismatches, while model predictive control (mpc) is suitable for such situations. in this paper, pid control and pfc algorithm are combined to form a new pid controller that has the basic characteristic of pfc algorithm and at the same time, the simple structure of traditional pid controller. the proposed controller was tested in terms of set-point tracking and disturbance rejection, where the obtained results showed that the proposed controller had the better ensemble performance compared with traditional pid controllers.

pid_controller	process control courses usually have a section of the course focused on the building of block diagrams for modeling, simulation, and analysis of open and closed loop processes. for this purpose, students are often oriented to build models using simulink or xcos because of the versatility of these powerful tools in the easy construction of mathematical models using the concept of block-oriented programming. in this paper we propose a model library built in the software emso that allows the user to create block diagrams for process control studies. emso is a powerful tool for process modeling, dynamic simulation and optimization, freely available for academic purpose. with the developed library, analysis of systems responses, even for complex processes, can be carried out and pid controller tuning tasks are made easier and less time-consuming to the students, allowing them to advance in the study of more complex control strategies such as ratio, cascade, override, feed forward, among others. students valued the developed tool as a very useful and practical one to favor a control course learning process and between equivalent and advantageous tool when compared with simulink and xcos.

system_identification	reliable and accurate short-term subway passenger flow prediction is important for passengers, transit operators, and public agencies. traditional studies focus on regular demand forecasting and have inherent disadvantages in predicting passenger flows under special events scenarios. these special events may have a disruptive impact on public transportation systems, and should thus be given more attention for proactive management and timely information dissemination. this study proposes a novel multiscale radial basis function (msrbf) network for forecasting the irregular fluctuation of subway passenger flows. this model is simplified using a matching pursuit orthogonal least squares algorithm through the selection of significant model terms to produce a parsimonious msrbf model. combined with transit smart card data, this approach not only exhibits superior predictive performance over prevailing computational intelligence methods for non-regular demand forecasting at least 30 min prior, but also leverages network knowledge to enhance prediction capability and pinpoint vulnerable subway stations for crowd control measures. three empirical studies with special events in beijing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the emergence of passenger flow bursts.

electrical_circuits	in this paper the electronic implementation of fitzhugh-nagumo (f-n) neurons via monolithic microwave integrated circuits (mmic) based upon a resonant tunneling diode (rtd) nonlinear transmission line (nltl) using a coplanar waveguide (cpw) is considered. the goals are twofold. in the framework of electrical equivalent circuit emulating nonlinear active wave propagation effects, it is shown, on one hand, how different physical mechanisms are responsible for the time evolution of given input signals. a key result is that this medium supports stable and stationary pulse propagation that is only determined by the parameters of the rtd-nltl and is independent of the boundary conditions. on the other hand, the influence of specific line elements on the output signal waveform is discussed in a most systematic manner. this leads, for the first time, to a more physical interpretation of the properties of the rtd-nltl and, furthermore, to interesting technical applications at multi-ghz frequencies and on picosecond time scales. as a result, physically based ways are elucidated regarding how the technical design of those compact neuromorphic electrical circuits can be optimized by numerical simulations and performed using standard mmic technologies.
control_engineering	online laboratories are useful and valuable resources in high education, especially in engineering studies. this work presents a methodology to create effective laboratories for learning that interact with a learning management system (lms) to achieve advanced integration. it is based on pedagogical aspects and considers not only the laboratory application itself but also related resources that complement it. the methodology is flexible, covers all possible cases, and it is structured in stages that can be used with any system architecture, standards, or type of online laboratory (virtual, remote, or hybrid) because it abstracts technical aspects at a high level. this methodology facilitates the creation of new online labs so that any teacher, even those without specialized knowledge, can clarify many of the questions that may arise and gain understanding of how to implement an effective online laboratory with lms integration to assist learning. as an example and validation of the methodology, this work describes a laboratory developed as a shared content object reference model (scorm) package which is hosted in the institutional lms at the university of jaen. the laboratory was presented to 338 students taking an industrial automation class, and student evaluations were quite positive.
system_identification	the present paper takes from the original outputonly identification approach named full dynamic compound inverse method (fdcim), recently published on this journal by the authors, and proposes an innovative, much enhanced version, in the description of more general forms of structural damping, including for classically adopted rayleigh damping. this has led to an extended fdcim formulation, which offers superior performance, on all the targeted identification parameters, namely: modal properties, rayleigh damping coefficients, structural features at the element-level and input seismic excitation time history. synthetic earthquake-induced structural response signals are adopted as input channels for the fdcim approach, towards comparison and validation. the identification algorithm is run first on a benchmark 3-storey shear-type frame, and then on a realistic 10-storey frame, also by considering noise added to the response signals. consistency of the identification results is demonstrated, with definite superiority of this latter fdcim proposal.
state_space_representation	the goal of the present study is to show how it is possible to estimate online the individual torques applied at each wheel of an automotive vehicle by using an unknown input observer together with a simple nonlinear state-space model. the necessary measurements are the steering angle, the usual rotation speed of each wheel plus the vertical load at the centre of each wheel. by doing this, this study anticipates the affordability of a new generation of wheel bearing with embedded measurements of transmitted forces. successful simulated experimentations using a realistic simulator are shown. validations are done using classical case studies of longitudinal, lateral and coupled dynamics. the present limits and some possible improvements of the proposed method are also discussed.

operational_amplifier	a simple voltage-to-frequency converter (vfc) with modulated duty cycles is proposed. the proposed vfc is composed of an operational amplifier, a voltage-to-current circuit, a charge and discharge circuit, a comparator, and a schmitt trigger. the 50% duty cycle signal is always obtained at the output of the schmitt trigger and multiple duty cycles can be obtained at the output of the comparator by simply adjusting an external voltage level. due to its simplicity, the proposed vfc circuit can be easily combined with other circuitry to extend its practical application. the errors caused by the circuit non-idealities are investigated to quantify the trade-offs between performance and cost. the proposed vfc, which features modulated duty cycles, is realized in a standard 0.18-m 1p6m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cmos) technology, and an active area of 210mx190m is occupied. experimental results show that the proposed converter is useful for output frequency ranges from 315khz to 2.53mhz with an input voltage range of 0.2-1.6v and a power consumption of 0.8mw.
system_identification	experimental modal analysis aims at identifying the modal properties (e.g., natural frequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes) of a structure using vibration measurements. two basic questions are encountered when operating in the frequency domain: is there a mode near a particular frequency? if so, how much spectral data near the frequency can be included for modal identification without incurring significant modeling error? for data with high signal-to-noise (s/n) ratios these questions can be addressed using empirical tools such as singular value spectrum. otherwise they are generally open and can be challenging, e.g., for modes with low sin ratios or close modes. in this work these questions are addressed using a bayesian approach. the focus is on operational modal analysis, i.e., with 'output-only' ambient data, where identification uncertainty and modeling error can be significant and their control is most demanding. the approach leads to 'evidence ratios' quantifying the relative plausibility of competing sets of modeling assumptions. the latter involves modeling the 'what-if-not' situation, which is non-trivial but is resolved by systematic consideration of alternative models and using maximum entropy principle. synthetic and field data are considered to investigate the behavior of evidence ratios and how they should be interpreted in practical applications.

system_identification	parkinson 's disease (pd) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, and postural instability. rigidity, defined as an increased resistance to passive movement of a joint, progresses faster than other motor signs in pd. rigidity is attributable to both exaggerated neural reflex and altered muscle mechanical properties. however, little is known about the contributions of individual components to rigidity. further, there is no evidence regarding the effects of dopaminergic medication on individual components. objectives of this study were to quantify the contributions of neural reflexes and intrinsic muscle properties to rigidity and investigate the effects of medication on each contributing component. joint torque and muscle activities of the wrist in 14 patients and 14 controls were measured during externally induced movements. each subject with pd was tested in off- and on-medication states. a system identification technique was applied to differentiate and quantify the neural reflex and intrinsic mechanical components. a mixed model of anova was performed to compare the differences between the two components of rigidity for both groups, and to compare between the off- and on-medication states for patients. the results showed that reflex and intrinsic components are comparable (p >0.05), and both are enhanced in subjects with pd than in the controls (p < 0.05). medication decreased the reflex component of rigidity (p < 0.01). it is concluded that both reflex and intrinsic factors are responsible for rigidity. present findings are clinically significant as they may provide guidance in development of effective therapeutic interventions.
electrical_network	the power loss reduction is one of the main targets for any electrical energy distribution company. in this paper the problem of the joint optimization of both topology and network parameters in a real smart grid is faced. a portion of the italian electric distribution network managed by the acea distribuzione s. p. a. located in rome is considered. it includes about 1200 user loads, 70 km of mv lines, 6 feeders, a thyristor voltage regulator and 6 distributed energy sources (5 generator sets and 1 photovoltaic plant). the power factor correction (pfc) is performed tuning the 5 generator sets and setting the state of the breakers in order to perform the distributed feeder reconfiguration (dfr). about the dfr, in this paper we introduce a simplified graph representation of the electrical network and we propose a new algorithm to find all the radial network configurations. the pfc and the dfr optimization is faced by defining and solving a suited multi-objective optimization problem adopting a genetic algorithm. tests have been performed by feeding the simulation environment with real data concerning dissipated and generated active and reactive power values. first results are very interesting, showing that considering all the possible admissible network configurations can help the optimization procedure in finding better solutions.
voltage_law	a new sub-space max-monomial modeling scheme for cmos transistors in sub-micron technologies is proposed to improve the modeling accuracy. major electrical parameters of cmos transistors in each sub-space from the design space are modeled with max-monomials. this approach is demonstrated to have a better accuracy for sub-micron technologies than singlespace models. sub-space modeling based geometric programming power optimization has been successfully applied to three different op-amps in 0.18 mu m technology. hspice simulation results show that sub-space modeling based gp optimization can allow efficient and accurate analog design. computational effort can be managed to an acceptable level when searching sub-spaces for transistors by using practical constraints. an efficient scheme in dealing with non-convex constraint inherent in kirchhoff 's voltage law is suggested in this paper. by using this scheme, the nonconvex constraint, such as posynomial equality, can be relaxed to a convex constraint without affecting the result.
electric_motor	a new topology of single-phase two stage ac to dc sepic converter in step down configuration with high efficiency at extremely low voltage gain is proposed with high input power factor and low input current total harmonic distortion. in this work, proposal has be given to modify conventional two stage ac to dc sepic converter introducing a switched capacitor branch in between the stages. the input current thd is kept low. the input power factor is high with two-loop feedback control. the proposed schemes can be used in the application of battery charging of electric motor vehicles.
digital_control	this paper explores the large-signal and small-signal dynamics of a series-capacitor (sc) buck-type converter and introduces an optimal closed-loop control scheme to accommodate both the steady-state and transient modes. as opposed to a conventional buck converter, where time-optimal control is realized by a single on-off cycle, in the sc-buck topology there is a need to distribute the switching phases to satisfy the charge-balance of the flying capacitor. the new control method hybrids a voltage-mode small-signal controller for steady-state operation and a non-linear, state-plane based transient-mode control scheme for load transients. a detailed principle of operation of the sc-buck converter is provided and explained through an average behavioral model and state-plane analysis. the operation of the controller is experimentally verified on a 12w 12v-to-1.5v converter, demonstrating voltage-mode control operation as well as time-optimal response for load transients.
electrical_circuits	stationary modes and their possible bifurcations in nonautonomous electrical circuits with nonlinear resistive elements, the voltage-current characteristic of which cannot be satisfied to known conditions of convergence, are investigated. the main result of this article is description of current modes in a single and three-phase circuit with asymmetric voltage-current characteristics. the most interesting result of investigation of these transient and steady current modes in nonlinear electrical circuits is the possibility of the quasi-periodical process with low-frequency component, values and significance of which can be modulated by modification of amplitude of external high-frequency three-phase voltage.
electric_motor	this paper aims to carry out an analysis of the way in which the turbulence of the testing explosive mixture, turbulence induced by the high speed rotation movement of the shaft of the motor, as well as the rotation of the interior cooling fan, influences the maximum explosion pressures recorded, when carrying out the type tests of electrical rotating machines, when running. the paper also presents the most important results obtained in the specific laboratory of insemex, during a research project carried out recently. even if electric motors for environments with explosion hazards are designed and manufactured following the same principles as the ones used for other electric machinery, they have certain particularities related to their field of use. from here the required type of protection is resolved, with a series of restrictions imposed to electric motor projects [3]. as widely known, in case of flameproof electric motors as well as in case of most of the technical equipment in general, design and manufacture exceeded long time ago the stage when the manufacturers used to apply their own design methods.
analog_signal_processing	an original analog function synthesizer circuit with increased accuracy will be presented, allowing to implement a multitude of important continuous mathematical functions. the accuracy of the proposed structure is excellent and the range of the input variable is strongly extended as a result of the third-order approximation of the implemented functions. the circuit performance is expected to be stable against process corners as all functions exclusively depend on current ratios. the great advantages of the increased modularity and controllability and of the associated reduced design costs per function represent an immediate consequence of the multiple functions realized by the proposed structure. the function synthesizer circuit is designed for implementing in 0.18 mu m cmos technology and it is supplied at 1.8v. the spice simulations confirm the estimated theoretical results, showing an approximating error smaller than 0.01% for the composing squaring block and smaller than 0.013% for the composing multiplier/divider block.
electric_motor	between may 1995 and june 1999 we equipped 81 barren-ground grizzly bears (ursus arctos) with satellite radio-collars within a study area of 235,000 km(2), centred 400 km northeast of yellowknife, northwest territories. we estimated 71 annual ranges of radio-tracked animals (greater than or equal to 38 locations years) using the 95% fixed kernel technique with least squares cross-validation. annual ranges of males ((x) over bar= 7,245 km(2), se = 1,158, n = 26) were larger than ranges of females ((x) over bar = 2,100 km(2), se = 279, n = 45). ranges increased in size as the proportional amount of exposed bedrock and other marginal habitats in the environment increased. annual ranges are the largest reported for grizzly bears in north america.
electricity	while several studies have examined the effect of renewable portfolio standard laws on renewable generation in states, previous literature has not assessed the potential for spatial dependence in these policies. using recent spatial panel methods, this paper estimates a number of econometric models to examine the impact of rps policies when spatial autocorrelation is taken into account. consistent with previous literature, we find that rps laws do not have a significant impact on renewable generation within a state. however, we find evidence that state rps laws have a significant positive impact on the share of renewable generation in the nerc region as a whole. these findings provide evidence that electricity markets are efficiently finding the lowest-cost locations to serve renewable load in states with more stringent rps laws. in addition, our results suggest that rps laws may be more effective tools for environmental policy than for economic development.
system_identification	this research proposed novel development of a 2-dof h infinity loop shaping structured controller based on particle swarm optimization (pso) that considers the closed-loop dynamic response, robustness, stability, and minimal control input in design criteria to control position of 3-dof pneumatic surgical robot. unlike other conventional h infinity controllers, the proposed controller offers robustness, high performance, but cost-effective simple structure, which has recently received attention from several researchers and preferred in industrial applications. the proposed technique is simulated and experimented on a nonlinear system of a pneumatic 3-dof surgical robot for a minimally invasive surgery (mis). mechanical design, dynamics modeling, and system identification of the surgical robot are conducted. the simulation results verify that the proposed controller can gain a better h infinity sub-optimal solution than the conventional 2-dof h infinity loop shaping controller. also, the experiments confirm that the proposed controller is capable to tolerate the perturbed conditions and can be alternative to the conventional controllers in pneumatic controlled system.

system_identification	the paper presents a general agent-based system identification framework as potential solution for data-driven models of building systems that can be developed and integrated with improved efficiency, flexibility and scalability, compared to centralized approaches. the proposed method introduces building sub-system agents, which are optimized independently, by solving locally a maximum likelihood estimation problem. several models are considered for the sub-system agents and a systematic selection approach is established considering the root mean square error, the parameter sensitivity to output trajectory and the parameter correlation. the final model is integrated from selected models for each agent. two different approaches are developed for the integration; the negotiated-shared parameter model, which is a distributed method, and the free-shared parameter model based on a decentralized method. the results from a case-study for a high performance building indicate that the model prediction accuracy of the new approach is fairly good for implementation in predictive control.
signal-flow_graph	in this paper, a unified algebraic transformation approach is presented for designing parallel recursive and adaptive digital filters and singular value decomposition (svd) algorithms. the approach is based on the explorations of some algebraic properties of the target algorithms' representations. several typical modern digital signal processing examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the technique. they include the cascaded orthogonal recursive digital filter, the givens rotation-based adaptive inverse qr algorithm for channel equalization, and the qr decomposition-based svd algorithms. all three examples exhibit similar throughput constraints. there exist long feedback loops in the algorithms' signal flow graph representation, and the critical path is proportional to the size of the problem, applying the proposed algebraic transformation techniques, parallel architectures are obtained for all three examples, for cascade orthogonal recursive filter, retiming transformation and orthogonal matrix decompositions (or pseudo-commutativity) are applied to obtain parallel filter architectures with critical path of five givens rotations. for adaptive inverse qr algorithm, the commutativity and associativity of the matrix multiplications are applied to obtain parallel architectures with critical path of either four givens rotations or three givens rotations plus two multiply-add operations, whichever turns out to be larger. for svd algorithms, retiming and associativity of the matrix multiplications are applied to derive parallel architectures with critical path of eight givens rotations. the critical paths of all parallel architectures are independent of the problem size as compared with being proportional to the problem size in the original sequential algorithms. parallelism is achieved at the expense of slight increase (or the same for the svd case) in the algorithms' computational complexity.

microcontroller	tropical soils are major players on co2 emissions and c cycling on earth. however, it is in tropical countries where scientists can have the most limited access to analytical tools needed for research on these processes. this paper describes the construction and test of a less than us 50 chamber for monitoring of multiple soil gas emissions. the system consisted on an array of three mq series gas sensors placed into an airtight container, a pic microcontroller and a custom-built software developed for data capture and visualization running on a laptop. a modified multiplexing of sensors was also incorporated in order to allow the parallel analysis in up to eight samples. the chamber, hereafter called senose (short for soil electric nose), was tested in two separate experiments. the first study used the three sensor array system in soil samples from colombia and ecuador, which were separated into two groups in order to study their gas emission patterns in d(+) glucose induced respiration tests. for a second experiment using a multiplexed sensor array in a different set of colombian soil samples, gas emission patterns were obtained from autoclaved soil with reduced microbial activity, which were further contaminated with diesel oil as c source. during the first study, in replicated 22 h continuous runs senose clearly showed differences in soil respiration patterns of these soil samples, and a prominent timing differential increase in gas production after spiking d(+) glucose, a proxy for organic c, as a substrate. results of the second study showed a clearly different pattern of gas emissions in diesel oil contaminated samples, when microbial activity was reduced by soil autoclaving. moreover, two groups of non-autoclaved soil subsamples differing only in diesel oil addition could also be differentiated with basis on their respiration patterns after some hours of gas tracking. based on these results we foresee a great potential from the use of this low cost system in fields such as soil microbiology, fertility, biotechnology and environmental sciences, where processes such as microbial activity, plant nutrient availability or soil pollutant turnover are tracked by monitoring their gas emission patterns.

operational_amplifier	in this paper, a low-power and precise electrical stimulator is introduced in which no operational amplifier (opamp) is used. for electrical stimulations that have low pulse width, an opamp with high slew rate is needed which is power consuming. in this work, the opamp is substituted with a digital circuitry. a 100 khz clock is also used to update the current of the stimulator in the stimulation phases in order to make the stimulator accurate enough. producing such a clock needs only few micro watts. this stimulator is simulated in a 0.18 mu m cmos process, as well. the simulation results shows that this stimulator has only 0.056% charge mismatch in 1 ma stimulation current with a pulse width of 32 mu s.
signal-flow_graph	a system for measuring the dielectric propel-ties of cereal grains from 1 to 350 mhz with a coaxial sample holder is presented. several polar alcohols were used to calibrate and verify permittivity measurements obtained with a signal-flow graph model from the full two-part s-parameter measurements. at the lowest frequencies (1-25 mhz), where the phase measurements are less accurate, a lumped parameter model was used for the dielectric loss factor measurements. the system was calibrated with measurements on air and decanol and verified with measurements on octanol, hexanol, and pentanol. the standard error for the polar alcohols used for verification was 2.3% for the dielectric constant and 7.6% for the dielectric loss factor. although measurements were taken on static samples, the sample holder is designed to accommodate flowing grain. dielectric properties measurements at 25 degrees c were taken on four hard red winter wheat cultivars ranging in moisture content from about 9% to 21% with bulk densities varying from 0.66 to 0.83 g/cm(3). most of the data agreed with measurements reported in the literature.
analog_signal_processing	carbon nanotubes dispersed in polymer matrix have been aligned in the form of fibers and interconnects and cured electrically and by uv light. conductivity and effective semiconductor tunneling against reverse to forward bias field have been designed to have differentiable current-voltage response of each of the fiber/channel. the current-voltage response is a function of the strain applied to the fibers along axial direction. biaxial and shear strains are correlated by differentiating signals from the aligned fibers/channels. using a small doping of magnetic nanoparticles in these composite fibers, magneto-resistance properties are realized which are strong enough to use the resulting magnetostriction as a state variable for signal processing and computing. various basic analog signal processing tasks such as addition, convolution and filtering etc. can be performed. these preliminary study shows promising application of the concept in combined analog-digital computation in carbon nanotube based fibers. various dynamic effects such as relaxation, electric field dependent nonlinearities and hysteresis on the output signals are studied using experimental data and analytical model.

signal-flow_graph	this article presents methods to translate a behavioral-level analog description into a field programmable analog array (fpaa) implementation. the methods consist of several steps that are referred to as function decomposition, macrocell synthesis, placement and routing, and postplacement simulation. the focus of this article is on the first three steps. the function decomposition step deals with decomposing a high-order system function into a set of lower-order functions. we present an efficient procedure for searching for an optimal solution. this procedure is based on first formally demonstrating the equivalence of two previously used optimization criteria. the objective of the macrocell synthesis step is to generate a hardware realization. a modified signal flow graph is introduced to represent fpaa circuits and graph transformations are used to identify the realizations that comply with the fpaa hardware constraints. the modified signal flow graph also allows scaling of capacitor values due to the limited set of allowable values in an fpaa. for the placement and routing step, an efficient method to estimate the circuit performance degradation due to parasitic effects is given. using performance degradation as the cost function, an algorithm for finding an optimal fpaa placement and routing configuration is given. the efficacy of the methods developed is demonstrated by direct measurements on a set of filters.
signal-flow_graph	using the signal-flow graph approach, a general synthesis method for the realisation of high-order voltage transfer functions is presented and a current conveyor filter is obtained. the resulting filter contains a minimum number of capacitors, at most 2n+3 resistors, as well as n+2 current conveyors of plus type, all of which operate in current-mode.
state_space_representation	this article discusses filtering, prediction and simulation in univariate and multivariate noncausal processes. a closed-form functional estimator of the predictive density for noncausal and mixed processes is introduced that provides prediction intervals up to a finite horizon h. a state-space representation of a noncausal and mixed multivariate vector autoregressive process is derived in two ways-by the partial fraction decomposition or from the real jordan canonical form. a recursive bhhh algorithm for the maximization of the approximate log-likelihood function is proposed, which calculates the filtered values of the unobserved causal and noncausal components of the process. the new methods are illustrated by a simulation study involving a univariate noncausal process with infinite variance.
pid_controller	this paper presents fuzzy-pid (fpid) control scheme for a blood glucose control of type 1 diabetic subjects. a new metaheuristic cuckoo search algorithm (csa) is utilized to optimize the gains of fpid controller. csa provides fast convergence and is capable of handling global optimization of continuous nonlinear systems. the proposed controller is an amalgamation of fuzzy logic and optimization which may provide an efficient solution for complex problems like blood glucose control. the task is to maintain normal glucose levels in the shortest possible time with minimum insulin dose. the glucose control is achieved by tuning the pid (proportional integral derivative) and fpid controller with the help of genetic algorithm and csa for comparative analysis. the designed controllers are tested on bergman minimal model to control the blood glucose level in the facets of parameter uncertainties, meal disturbances and sensor noise. the results reveal that the performance of csa-fpid controller is superior as compared to other designed controllers.
signal-flow_graph	this paper presents a systematic development of unified signal flow graph model for an interleaved buck converter system operating in continuous inductor current mode. from this signal flow graph small, large-signal and steady-state models are developed, which are useful to study the converter dynamic and steady-state behaviour. converter performance expressions like steady-state voltage gain, efficiency expressions and other small-signal characteristic transfer functions are derived. development of unified signal flow graph is explained for a 3-cell interleaved converter system. derivation of large, small-signal and steady-state models from the unified signal flow graph is demonstrated by considering a 2-cell interleaved buck converter system. large signal model was programmed in tutsim simulator, and the large-signal responses against supply, load disturbances were predicted. signal flow graph analysis results are validated with psim simulations. further, the mathematical models obtained from the signal flow graph modelling are in agreement with those obtained from the state-space averaging technique. copyright (c) 2003 john wiley sons, ltd.
microcontroller	wearable heaters have been increasingly attracting researchers' great interest due to their efficient utility in maintaining warmth and in thermotherapy. nowadays carbon nanomaterials and metallic nanowires tend to become the mainstream heating elements in wearable heaters considering their excellent electrical and mechanical properties. though considerable progress has been made, there still exist challenging issues that need to be addressed in practical applications, including bad breathability and poor endurance to mechanical deformations. here, we devise a copper nanowire based composite fiber with a unique hierarchical structure. this fiber possesses not only excellent heating performance, but also fantastic tolerance to mechanical impact, such as bending, twisting, and stretching. we further weave these fibers into a wearable heating fabric and realize smart personal heating management through an android phone by integrating with a microcontroller unit. two practical applications are demonstrated including a heating kneepad for articular thermotherapy and a heating coat on an infant model for maintaining warmth.
electrical_network	the emergence of many non-linear loads causes severe disturbances in the present power system. it affects the power quality thereby decreasing the overall efficiency. the important issue among the power quality is harmonics that becomes the major concern in the power system network. this survey mainly discusses the causes and effects of harmonics in the electrical network. it also discusses the various detection techniques that detects and analyzes the presence of harmonics in the system. in addition to this, this survey also discusses the new technique called pan tompkins algorithm to detect the harmonics with the communication protocol as cloud computing.
system_identification	we study the modeling of lagrangian systems with multiple degrees of freedom. based on system dynamics, canonical parametric models require ad hoc derivations and sometimes simplification for a computable solution; on the other hand, due to the lack of prior knowledge in the system 's structure, modern nonparametric models in machine learning face the curse of dimensionality, especially in learning large systems. in this paper, we bridge this gap by unifying the theories of lagrangian systems and vector-valued reproducing kernel hilbert space. we reformulate lagrangian systems with kernels that embed the governing euler-lagrange equation-the lagrangian kernels-and show that these kernels span a subspace capturing the lagrangian 's projection as inverse dynamics. by such property, our model uses only inputs and outputs as in machine learning and inherits the structured form as in system dynamics, thereby removing the need for the mundane derivations for new systems as well as the generalization problem in learning from scratches. in effect, it learns the system 's lagrangian, a simpler task than directly learning the dynamics. to demonstrate, we applied the proposed kernel to identify the robot inverse dynamics in simulations and experiments. our results present a competitive novel approach to identifying lagrangian systems, despite using only inputs and outputs.
state_space_representation	our focus is on realistically modeling and forecasting dynamic networks of face-to-face contacts among individuals. important aspects of such data that lead to problems with current methods include the tendency of the contacts to move between periods of slow and rapid changes, and the dynamic heterogeneity in the actors' connectivity behaviors. motivated by this application, we develop a novel method for locally adaptive dynamic (lady) network inference. the proposed model relies on a dynamic latent space representation in which each actor 's position evolves in time via stochastic differential equations. using a state-space representation for these stochastic processes and polya-gamma data augmentation, we develop an efficient mcmc algorithm for posterior inference along with tractable procedures for online updating and forecasting of future networks. we evaluate performance in simulation studies, and consider an application to face-to-face contacts among individuals in a primary school.
electricity	microgrids assisted by renewable energy resources are complex man made systems of various interconnected components. a number of real life scenarios relating to resource management in microgrids are modeled as multi-objective optimization formulations where multiple objectives may or may not conflict with each other. while considering the type of application, input and output of the problem, the nature of optimization problem changes. to address various types of optimization problems relating to microgid design, planning and operation, there exist a number of optimization solution types. we investigate the existing literature to classify different optimization objectives with respect to designing, planning and operation of microgrids. some mathematical formulations for commonly used objectives relating to resource management in microgrids have been tabulated. we also classified the optimization types being used to address various optimization problems relating to resource management in microgrids. various types of solution approaches along with the relevant simulation tools are also presented. we also reviewed the multicriteria optimization for different application areas of smart grid. the article can serve as a foundation for further research in the area of multicriteria decision making relating to resource management in micrgorids.
microcontroller	in this paper we proposed, designed and evaluated a novel decentralized and self-learning framework to support both high reliability and energy-efficiency for periodic traffic applications in wsns. our autonomous framework comprises three main components: estimation and identification of periodic flows, dynamic wakeup-sleep scheduling and asynchronous channel hopping. with asynchronous channel hopping the frequency hopping pattern is determined by each source node autonomously, and forwarders have to identify and follow the pattern. we also propose a light and efficient controller to eliminate the collision caused by multi-flow overlap at forwarders. we present design and evaluation of our autonomous framework using realistic trace-based simulation. the results show that our asynchronous channel hopping solution improves the packet reception rate compared to the single channel solutions without the need of an expensive signaling and time synchronization overhead. we also show that with this scheme the average energy consumption yields a 50 % lower than the single channel solutions. furthermore, we analyze in detail the energy consumption characteristics of our autonomous framework when operated with a popular transceiver, the chipcon cc2420 and texas instruments msp430 microcontroller. we analyze how much various factors contribute to the overall energy consumption. these insights provide valuable guidance on where to start with any effort geared towards saving energy.
digital_control	fault detection in induction machines is commonly realized through motor current signature analysis. in case of wound-rotor induction machine rotor faults, the amplitude of the inverse sequence harmonic component -sf of the rotor current space-vector is monitored in order to sense its variation. however, motor current signature analysis is limited by some drawbacks. in fact, under transient operating conditions an efficient fast fourier transform cannot be made, since slip or frequency vary, and so the amplitude of the harmonic component -sf. in this paper, a new technique based on the square current space-vector signature analysis (scssa) is proposed for rotor fault detection in wound-rotor induction machines operating under time-varying conditions. the performance of the proposed approach is confirmed by simulation and experimental results. the proposed technique can be easily embedded in the digital control system for modern wind power plants.
microcontroller	continuous monitoring of environmental parameters provides farmers with useful information, which can improve the quality and productivity of crops grown in greenhouses. the objective of this study was to develop a greenhouse environment measurement system using a low-cost microcontroller with open-source software. greenhouse environment parameters measured were air temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide (co2) concentration. the ranges of the temperature, relative humidity, and co2 concentration were -40 to 120 degrees c, 0 to 100%, and 0 to 10,000 ppm, respectively. a 128 x 64 graphic lcd display was used for real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environments. an arduino uno r3 consisted of a usb interface for communicating with a computer, 6 analog inputs, and 14 digital input/output pins. a temperature/relative humidity sensor was connected to digital pins 2 and 3. a co2 sensor was connected to digital pins 12 and 13. the lcd was connected to digital pin 1 (tx). the sketches were programmed with the arduino software (ide). a measurement system including the arduino board, sensors, and accessories was developed (totaling $244). data for the environmental parameters in a venlo-type greenhouse were obtained using this system without any problems. we expect that the low-cost microcontroller using open-source software can be used for monitoring the environments of plastic greenhouses in korea.
pid_controller	in feedback control of mechatronic systems, sensor signals are usually noisy and uncertain because of measurement errors and environmental disturbances. such uncertainty and noise of feedback signals may cause instability of the controlled systems. this paper presents a new model-free discrete-time sliding mode filter for effectively removing noise by balancing the tradeoff between the filtering smoothness and the suppression of delay. the presented filter is an extension of a sliding mode filter (jin et al. real-time quadratic sliding mode filter for removing noise. adv. robot., 2012) by including an adaptive gain, of which value is determined in a similar way to that of a first-order adaptive windowing filter (janabi-sharifi et al. discrete-time adaptive windowing for velocity estimation. ieee trans. control syst. technol., 2000). the effectiveness of the presented filter is validated through numerical examples and experiments.
analog_signal_processing	wing-wave is an ocean, alternative energy system to convert the circular motion of ocean waves as they propagate through the sea into electrical energy. the system consists of planes, called ""wings"". the wings are mounted on the sea floor and move in a radial motion as a result of the passing waves. the mechanical energy is translated into electrical energy by means of an electrical generator. three wing-wave prototype systems were built at florida institute of technology (florida tech) and deployed november 17th, 2010, june 23rd, 2011, and june 6th, 2012, respectively. each deployment provided valuable information that lead to modifications in subsequent versions and deployment techniques, culminating in the demonstration of a fully functioning and feasible alternative, renewable, electrical energy producing subsea system.
analog_signal_processing	a fuzzy sets intersection procedure to select the optimum sizes of analog circuits composed of metal-oxidesemiconductor field-effect-transistors (mosfets), is presented. the cases of study are voltage followers (vfs) and a current-feedback operational amplifier (cfoa), where the width (w) and length (l) of the mosfets are selected from the space of feasible solutions computed by swarm or evolutionary algorithms. the evaluation of three objectives, namely: gain, bandwidth and power consumption; is performed using hspice (tm) with standard integrated circuit (ic) technology of 0.35 mu m for the vfs and 180nm for the cfoa. therefore, the intersection procedure among three fuzzy sets representing ""gain close to unity"", ""high bandwidth"" and ""minimum power consumption"", is presented. the main advantage relies on its usefulness to select feasible w/l sizes automatically but by considering deviation percentages from the desired target specifications. basically, assigning a threshold to each fuzzy set does it. as a result, the proposed approach selects the best feasible sizes solutions to guarantee and to enhance the performances of the ics in analog signal processing applications.

analog_signal_processing	development of new ways to provide clean onboard electric energy is a key feature for the sailing boat industry and sail race teams. this is why marine turbines (mt), are considered to provide onboard energy. these turbines can be used to harness kinetic energy of the water flow related to the ship motion. in this paper we propose to study an unconventional design of such a turbine where the electrical generator is located in the periphery of the blades and where the magnetic gap is water filled. this kind of solution called ""rim driven"" structure allows to increase the compactness and the robustness of the system. due to the strong interaction of the multi physical phenomena, an electromagnetic model and a thermal model of the pm generator are associated with a hydrodynamic model of the blades and of the water flow in the underwater air gap. these models are used in a global coupled design approach in order to optimize, under constraints, the global efficiency of the system. this solution allows to optimize the system design.
electrical_circuits	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to propose a method to reduce the non-linear distortion of a transistor to its input and output ports to aid distortion contribution analysis (dca). this is especially needed when the internal structure of a device model is complex. design/methodology/approach - the non-linear distortion generated by all non-linear sources inside a device model are reduced to transistor i/o ports by lmse fitting techniques. simulations of an ldmos power transistor are used to compare the reduced distortion results with the actual non-linear sources. findings - it is shown, that device models where the current sources are split by intermediate nodes cause superficial results, when distortion contributions are calculated as a superposition of contributions from individual non-linear sources. the proposed iterative fitting technique works. research limitations/implications - some non-quasistatic effects and the transfer functions from external terminals to internal controlling nodes are not covered. practical implications - the analysis is a step toward a generic non-linear distortion contribution simulation tool that would aid the designers to develop more linear analog circuits. originality/value - the concept of dca itself is fairly new. this paper makes a step to represent the distortion sources in a canonical way.
pid_controller	proportional-integral-derivative (pid) control has been widely used in industrial equipment. however, the transient response obtained is poor when the fixed pid controller is used for nonlinear systems. moreover, a hydraulic excavator consists of a nonlinear system with a derivative element. in this case, the system output does not track the reference signal because the integral element in the controller is canceled out by the derivative element in the system. in order to improve the transient response and the tracking performance, a data-driven pid control for tuning and updating pid gains has been proposed. however, the data-driven pid control method could not improve the tracking performance. in this paper, the controller design scheme based on a data-driven approach for the hydraulic excavator is proposed. moreover, the control parameters of the proposed scheme are updated in an off-line manner by using fictitious reference iterative tuning. the effectiveness of this controller is verified by simulating the control behavior of a hydraulic excavator.

signal-flow_graph	this paper reports the design and development of reconfigurable (up to 8192-point), data parallel, constant geometry fast fourier transform (cg-fft) architectures based on network-on-chip (noc) paradigm. twiddle factor multiplications have been realized using pipelined cordic rotators in the proposed architecture in order to ensure its high throughput. mapping of fft functions to cores has been done by considering the proposed signal flow graph (sfg) for cg-fft architecture, which helps in optimizing the design of network components (routers and network interfaces) and reducing the latency of fft computation. the proposed input-size aware architecture can withstand faults in other processing elements (pes) as it can accomplish the entire fft computation using only one pe as well. when mapped onto mesh based noc, the proposed architectures could achieve reduction in latency by 5 x, compared to several existing, fft architectures on noc. hardware realization of the pe and the network components of the proposed architectures have been done using xilinx kintex-7 family field-programmable gate array (fpga) device. the maximum operating frequency of a pe in the proposed architecture has been found to be 184.010 mhz, which meets the timing specifications of several application standards, such as dvb-t/h, dab, 802.11a/n and uwb. in addition to the fpga-prototype, the proposed architectures have also been synthesized in asic design flow to obtain area and power results.

system_identification	background: many healthcare organizations have developed disclosure policies for large-scale adverse events, including the veterans health administration (va). this study evaluated va 's national large-scale disclosure policy and identifies gaps and successes in its implementation. methods: semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with leaders, hospital employees, and patients at nine sites to elicit their perceptions of recent large-scale adverse events notifications and the national disclosure policy. data were coded using the constructs of the consolidated framework for implementation research (cfir). results: we conducted 97 interviews. insights included how to handle the communication of large-scale disclosures through multiple levels of a large healthcare organization and manage ongoing communications about the event with employees. of the 5 cfir constructs and 26 sub-constructs assessed, seven were prominent in interviews. leaders and employees specifically mentioned key problem areas involving 1) networks and communications during disclosure, 2) organizational culture, 3) engagement of external change agents during disclosure, and 4) a need for reflecting on and evaluating the policy implementation and disclosure itself. patients shared 5) preferences for personal outreach by phone in place of the current use of certified letters. all interviewees discussed 6) issues with execution and 7) costs of the disclosure. conclusions: cfir analysis reveals key problem areas that need to be addresses during disclosure, including: timely communication patterns throughout the organization, establishing a supportive culture prior to implementation, using patient-approved, effective communications strategies during disclosures; providing follow-up support for employees and patients, and sharing lessons learned.
electricity	studies on the implications of population density on energy consumption in small and medium-sized cities in low- and middle-income countries are limited. this paper estimates and analyses energy consumption, using a diverse set of methods, to compare two medium-sized cities in thailand with similar urban forms and socioeconomic characteristics but different population densities - namely, the less dense city chaiyaphum and denser city roi et. the results reveal that the annual household electricity consumption per capita of these two cities is similar, showing no implications of density. however, private transport energy consumption per capita in chaiyaphum is 22 per cent higher, supporting the hypothesis that a less dense city will have higher transport energy consumption. the key factor identified is the greater distance travelled by households located in the peri-urban areas in the less dense city. this has important policy implications for urban planning and urban development practices in thailand.

system_identification	a novel adaptive weight online sequential extreme learning machine (awos-elm) is proposed for predicting time series problems based on an online sequential extreme learning machine (os-elm) in this paper. in real-world online applications, the sequentially coming data chunk usually possesses varying confidence coefficients, and the data chunk with a low confidence coefficient tends to mislead the subsequent training process. the proposed awos-elm can improve the training process by accessing the confidence coefficient adaptively and determining the training weight accordingly. experiments on six time series prediction data sets have verified that the awos-elm algorithm performs better in generalization performance, stability, and prediction ability than the os-elm algorithm. in addition, a real-world mechanical system identification problem is considered to test the feasibility and efficacy of the awos-elm algorithm.
state_space_representation	this paper studies the estimation of the frictional torque of the synchromesh during the gear shifting operation in an electric vehicle equipped with a clutchless automated manual transmission (amt). the clutchless drivetrain of the electric vehicle is discussed and the dynamical model of the powertrain from the electric traction motor to the synchromesh system of a two-speed amt is developed. in order to estimate the frictional torque of the synchromesh, which is indeed an unknown input to the dynamical system, it is assumed to be generated by a fictitious autonomous system. thereafter, the augmented state- space representation of the actual and fictitious state variables, which forms the basis for the observer design, is provided and the observability of this augmented system is discussed. a deterministic luenberger observer and a stochastic kalman-bucy filter are designed in order to estimate the frictional torque of the synchromesh. the estimation is based on the measuring angular velocities of the electric motor and synchro ring together with the known electromagnetic torque of the traction motor. the performance of the observers is assessed experimentally by means of a test rig. the results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the stochastic observer when the system encounters process and measurement noise which are likely to happen in practice.
analog_signal_processing	the first fully integrated 2d cmos imaging sensor with on-chip signal processing for applications in laser doppler blood flow (ldbf) imaging has been designed and tested. to obtain a space efficient design over 64 x 64 pixels means that standard processing electronics used off-chip cannot be implemented. therefore the analog signal processing at each pixel is a tailored design for ldbf signals with balanced optimization for signal-to-noise ratio and silicon area. this custom made sensor offers key advantages over conventional sensors, viz. the analog signal processing at the pixel level carries out signal normalization; the ac amplification in combination with an anti-aliasing filter allows analog-to-digital conversion with a low number of bits; low resource implementation of the digital processor enables on-chip processing and the data bottleneck that exists between the detector and processing electronics has been overcome. the sensor demonstrates good agreement with simulation at each design stage. the measured optical performance of the sensor is demonstrated using modulated light signals and in vivo blood flow experiments. images showing blood flow changes with arterial occlusion and an inflammatory response to a histamine skin-prick demonstrate that the sensor array is capable of detecting blood flow signals from tissue.
electric_motor	this paper focuses on the variability in vibration from electromagnetic origin for an electric motor. the multiphysics modeling is introduced by the magnetic force density computation and by the coupling of the 2d electromagnetic and 3d structural dynamic finite element models. the modal stability procedure (msp) and the monte carlo simulation (mcs) are associated for the variability calculation of natural frequencies and frequency response functions (frfs) of finite element systems with material random parameters. the msp formulations are developed for 8-node solid hexahedron element modeling the electric stator. the mcs-msp approach only requires a single finite element analysis, leading to a fast monte carlo simulation using msp formulation. the validation of mcs-msp is investigated, the uncertainty propagation is discussed and the computational costs of mcs-msp are presented. this non intrusive method provides an evaluation of frequencies and frfs variability for industrial-size models with a large number of degrees of freedom, a large number of random variables and a low or moderate variability level.

signal-flow_graph	this paper presents a generalized mixed-radix decimation-in-time (dit) fast algorithm for computing the modified discrete cosine transform (mdct) of the composite lengths n=2 x q(m), m >= 2, where q is an odd positive integer. the proposed algorithm not only has the merits of parallelism and numerical stability, but also needs less multiplications than that of type-iv discrete cosine transform (dct-iv) and type-ii discrete cosine transform (dct-ii) based mdct algorithms due to the optimized efficient length-(n/q) modules. the computation of mdct for composite lengths n=q(m) x 2(n), m >= 2, n >= 2, can then be realized by combining the proposed algorithm with fast radix-2 mdct algorithm developed for n=2(n). the combined algorithm can be used for the computation of length-12/36 mdct used in mpeg-1/-2 layer iii audio coding as well as the recently established wideband speech and audio coding standards such as g.729.1, where length-640 mdct is used. the realization of the inverse mdct (imdct) can be obtained by transposing the signal flow graph of the mdct.

system_identification	this paper studies the stochastic behavior of the signed variants of the lms algorithm for a system identification framework when the input signal is a cyclostationary white gaussian process. three algorithms are studied: the signed regressor, the signed error, and the sign-sign algorithms. the input cyclostationary signal is modeled by a white gaussian random process with periodically time-varying power. the system parameters vary according to a random-walk. mathematical models are derived for the mean and mean-square-deviation behavior of the adaptive weights with the input cyclostationarity. these models are used to derive new results concerning the performance of the algorithms. some of these results are surprising. monte carlo simulations of the three algorithms provide strong support for the theory.
control_engineering	the manufacturing industry currently faces the big challenges of global competition dealing with the increasing costs of energy and raw materials on the one hand, and with the increasing quality requirements for high product technology and innovation expectations of the customer on the other hand. in the next decade, the overall progress of the technology will demand new strategies to increase the international acceptance and positive management of the increasing competition in the global market. this paper is a proposal to establish a strategic approach of an advanced, intelligent and networked measurement technique with automated measurement and evaluation processes as well as the highest accuracy and the smallest uncertainty of the measurement processes for both research, higher education and at the same time for the manufacturing industry. using an example application, the development of modeling, construction and implementation of the experiments in an inter-university network are demonstrated. thereby, the cooperation and implementation of the working steps in two remote research laboratories, namely the nanotechnology laboratory aum at the vienna university of technology in austria and the control engineering laboratory utn-frba in argentina are described.
system_identification	process measurements are of vital importance for monitoring and control of industrial plants. when we consider offshore oil production platforms, wells that require gas-lift technology to yield oil production from low pressure oil reservoirs can become unstable under some conditions. this undesirable phenomenon is usually called slugging flow, and can be identified by an oscillatory behavior of the downhole pressure measurement. given the importance of this measurement and the unreliability of the related sensor, this work aims at designing data-driven soft-sensors for downhole pressure estimation in two contexts: one for speeding up first-principle model simulation of a vertical riser model; and another for estimating the downhole pressure using real-world data from an oil well from petrobras based only on topside platform measurements. both tasks are tackled by employing echo state networks (esn) as an efficient technique for training recurrent neural networks. we show that a single esn is capable of robustly modeling both the slugging flow behavior and a steady state based only on a square wave input signal representing the production choke opening in the vertical riser. besides, we compare the performance of a standard network to the performance of a multiple timescale hierarchical architecture in the second task and show that the latter architecture performs better in modeling both large irregular transients and more commonly occurring small oscillations.

electric_motor	satellite radio posed a new question for canadian policy-makers: how to take advantage of a transnational radio service while ensuring cultural identity was not lost within channel offerings that are predominately american. comparing the initial licensing of satellite radio in canada (2005) to the merger of the services (2011) and the post-merger license renewal (2012) highlights a shift in the spatial understanding of satellite radio, from being determined by a satellite 's footprint to that of what i call 'cultural lifelines,' the various mobile devices and services that enable one to maintain connection to cultural content. alongside shifting spatial considerations of satellite radio, canadian content has increasingly been packaged as a brand or genre, catering to fragmented taste preferences and individual, mobile listening practices.
electrical_circuits	this article deals with chua 's circuit characterization from the point of view of a filter based on the concept of piecewise linear functions. furthermore, experiments are developed for teaching electronic systems that can be used for novel filtering concepts. the frequency range in which they are tested is from 20 hz to 20 khz, due to the audio spectrum comprised in this frequency range. the node associated with the capacitor and chua 's diode is used as input, and the node for another capacitor and the coil is used as output, thereby establishing one input-output relationship for each system case given by the piecewise linear functions. the experimental result shows that chua 's circuit behaves as a bandpass filter-amplifier, with a maximum frequency around 3 khz and bandwidth between 1.5 khz and 5.5 khz. the results presented in this paper can motivate engineering students to pursue applications of novel electrical circuits based on topics that are of potential interest in their future research studies.
electric_motor	population sizes of ice-associated pinnipeds have often been estimated with visual or photographic aerial surveys, but these methods require relatively slow speeds and low altitudes, limiting the area they can cover. recent developments in infrared imagery and its integration with digital photography could allow substantially larger areas to be surveyed and more accurate enumeration of individuals, thereby solving major problems with previous survey methods. we conducted a trial survey in april 2003 to estimate the number of pacific walruses (odobenus rosmarus divergens) hauled out on sea ice around st. lawrence island, alaska. the survey used high altitude infrared imagery to detect groups of walruses on strip transects. low altitude digital photography was used to determine the number of walruses in a sample of detected groups and calibrate the infrared imagery for estimating the total number of walruses. we propose a survey design incorporating this approach with satellite radio telemetry to estimate the proportion of the population in the water and additional low-level flights to estimate the proportion of the hauled-out population in groups too small to be detected in the infrared imagery. we believe that this approach offers the potential for obtaining reliable population estimates for walruses and other ice-associated pinnipeds.
electric_motor	cycling induced by automatic control of functional electrical stimulation provides a means of therapeutic exercise and functional restoration for people affected by paralysis. during cycling induced by functional electrical stimulation, various muscle groups are stimulated according to the cycle crank angle; however, because of kinematic constraints on the cycle-rider system, stimulation is typically only applied in a subsection of the crank cycle. therefore, these systems can be considered as switched control systems with autonomous, state-dependent switching with potentially unstable modes. previous studies have included an electric motor in the system to provide additional control authority, but no studies have considered the effects of switched control in the stability analysis of the motorized functional electrical stimulation cycling system. in this paper, a model of the motorized cycle-rider system with functional electrical stimulation is developed that includes the effects of a switched control input. a novel switching strategy for the electric motor is designed to only provide assistance in the regions of the crank cycle where the kinematic effectiveness of the rider 's muscles is low. a switched sliding-mode controller is designed, and global, exponentially stable tracking of a desired crank trajectory is guaranteed via lyapunov methods for switched systems, despite parametric uncertainty in the nonlinear model and unknown, time-varying disturbances. experimental results from five able-bodied, passive riders are presented to validate the control design, and the developed control system achieves an average cadence tracking error of revolutions per minute for a desired trajectory of 50 revolutions per minute. note to practitioners-autonomous systems designed for rehabilitation and functional assistance for people with disabilities such as paralysis have the potential to maximize rehabilitative outcomes and improve the quality of life for millions of people. disorders such as paralysis drastically reduce a person 's ability to complete tasks due to a loss of neuromuscular control. functional electrical stimulation can activate paralyzed muscles, restoring functional ability through automated application of electric current to the neuromuscular system, and, when applied to a task such as cycling, is both rehabilitative and empowering. however, cycling induced by functional electrical stimulation is limited by the capability of the rider 's muscles, so an electric motor is typically added to accommodate the rider 's ability and to support stability. the response by muscle to electrical stimulation is uncertain, time-varying, and nonlinear, and switching the control input across multiple muscle groups and between the rider and an electric motor make guaranteeing stability and performance challenging. this paper presents a novel approach to the challenge of controlling motorized cycling systems with functional electrical stimulation that considers the switching effects and guarantees exponentially stable tracking of a desired crank trajectory, and experimental results indicate how the control system may be applied to a rehabilitative cycling task. directions for future research are aimed at implementation of the developed control system in patient populations with paralysis to quantify its impact on therapeutic outcomes such as muscle function and neuroplasticity.
digital_control	repetitive control strategies have been commonly applied in pulse-width-modulated (pwm) voltage source inverters (vsis) for many industrial applications. this paper presents a repetitive controller for voltage harmonic mitigation of vsi-based islanded microgrids. the phase delay in the overall control system, e.g., the delay caused by the digital duty cycle calculation, pwm generation, and repetitive controller, has to be compensated by elaborately designed phase lead filters in order to prevent control performance deterioration and system instability. nevertheless, quantificational analysis and practical design of the time advance unit in such filters are hardly found in existing literature works. in view of this, this paper proposes an explicit analysis of the phase lead filters and a novel design method of the time advance unit in repetitive controllers to ensure system stability. moreover, with the help of the proposed method, the overall system stability margin is predictable and improved controller performance is achieved as well. the proposed method is implemented experimentally to show the accurate stability margin calculation as well as the excellent steady state and dynamic performances of the repetitive control scheme.
electric_motor	this work focuses on a development of an accurate finite element method (fem) model to predict the reed critical frequency (rcf) of an electric motor and a study of the influence of the fixation base on the deviations from the numerical to the experimental results. ideally, the base for experimental tests needs to be sized in a way to avoid any deflection or displacement in the attachment position of the motor. in order to evaluate the fem model and the influence of the base characteristics in the rcf results, three testing bases were used to test the same electric motor. the relation of the masses of the bases to the mass of the motor are nearly eight times, twenty seven times and ninety eight times, respectively.
electric_motor	a new model of power-assisted bicycle has been designed, set up and tested. the main innovative solutions for the pedelec prototype are described in the present paper: the electric motor position; the new mechanical transmission; the low cost measurement system of the driving torque; the special test rig. differently from a common approach, in which the electric motor is located on one of the three hubs of the bicycle, the idea of the pedelec prototype consists of an electrical motor in the central position that, by means of a bevel gear, transmits the torque on the central hub. the other innovative solution is represented by the motion transmission from the motor to the pedal shaft, achieved by two different gearboxes: the first one is a planetary gearbox and the second one is a simple bevel gear. the pedelec prototype contains also a new low cost measurement system of the driving torque based on a strain gauge load cell located on one side of the rear wheel, between the hub and the frame. moreover, a commercial cycling simulator has been suitably modified in order to properly install the different sensors for the measurement of the performance of the pedelec. the test rig is able to reproduce an aforethought route or paths acquired during road tests, to measure the performance of the e-bike in terms of instantaneous power and speed. the experimental test rig can simulate the resistant torque of a predetermined track and it aims to test and to optimize the control strategy available on the electronic control unit. the authors have also conducted an environmental analysis of the developed pedelec, in particular comparing the e-bike with a thermal moped, in terms of environmental impact.

control_engineering	the paper presents an extended structure for a minimum variance adaptive control system of an induction generator, which aims to improve its operating behavior under electrical short-circuit conditions. the basic design idea is to limit the control to physically achievable values, and thus increasing the robustness of the control system and avoiding an instability regime. a control limiting block is proposed and used for this purpose. moreover, a short-circuit detector enables an on-line setting of the control penalty factor, improving the quality of the controlled output. all these additional customizations of the control system, implemented to keep the plant operational under and after a short-time short-circuit fault (acting as an abnormal perturbation), must also provide good performance in the normal operating mode.
electrical_network	frequency response analysis (fra) is a technique used to diagnose the mechanical integrity of a transformer winding; such diagnostic tools can be of enormous value since power transformers are a critical asset within any electrical network. to minimize the probability of an unexpected outage, or prevent a catastrophic failure, maintenance and monitoring of power transformers is essential for utilities. over the past couple of decades, fra has been utilized as an off-line diagnosis method. however, with the recent development in smart grid systems, there is now a growing interest in the development of on-line fra techniques. this paper proposes a technique for in-service monitoring of power transformer winding deformation, which uses a broad frequency sine wave voltage excitation signal and high frequency current transformers (ct) in conjunction with the bushings test taps. experiments using this system were conducted and then validated on a single-phase 22kv/110v voltage transformer.
electricity	the light emitting diode (led) based visible light communication (vlc) system can provide lighting and communication simultaneously. it has attracted much attenuation recently. as the photovoltaic cell (also known as solar cell) is physically flexible, low cost, and easily available, it could be a good choice for the vlc receiver (rx). furthermore, besides acting as the vlc rx, the solar cell can convert vlc signal into electricity for charging up the rx devices. hence, it could be a promising candidate for the future internet-of-thing (iot) networks. however, using solar cell as vlc rx is challenging, since the response of the solar cell is highly limited and it will limit the vlc data rate. in this work, we propose and demonstrate for the first time using pre-distortion manchester coding (mc) signal to enhance the signal performance of solar cell rx based vlc. the proposed scheme can significantly mitigate the slow response, as well as the direct-current (dc) wandering effect of the solar cell; hence 50 times increase in data rate can be experimentally achieved.
operational_amplifier	three novel differential amplifier topologies using double gate a-igzo tfts on flexible substrate are presented in this paper. the designs exploit positive feedback and a load with self-biased top gate to achieve the highest static gain in single stage a-igzo amplifiers reported to date. after fabrication, the three amplifiers exhibit respectively a static gain of 14 db, 21.5 db, and 30 db, with a bandwidth of 2 khz, 400 hz, and 150 hz. also, for each circuit the input referred noise has been measured to be 420 mu v-rms, 195 mu v-rms, and 146 mu v-rms, respectively. based on these results, the a-igzo amplifier providing the highest gain is suitable as front-end for heart rate measurements and, with some further optimization verified in simulation, can also be used for other bio-potential applications, like electro hysterogram and electro cardiogram.
electricity	this paper addresses electricity transmission planning under the new industry and institutional structure of the mexican electricity market, which has engaged in a deep reform process after decades of a state-owned vertically -integrated-non-competitive-closed industry. under this new structure, characterized by a nodal pricing system and an independent system operator (iso), we analyze welfare-optimal network expansion with two modeling strategies. in a first model, we propose the use of an incentive price-cap mechanism to promote the expansion of mexican networks. in a second model, we study centrally-planned grid expansion in mexico by an iso within a power-flow model. we carry out comparisons of these models which provide us with hints to evaluate the actual transmission planning process proposed by mexican authorities (prodesen). we obtain that the prodesen plan appears to be a convergent welfare-optimal planning process.
electric_motor	the problem of vehicle lateral stability control for fully electric vehicles is addressed in this paper using two different approaches. one of them is a novel integrated lateral stability control (ilsc) system and the second one is a regenerative braking based lateral stability control system (rb-lsc). the proposed ilsc system is based on corrective yaw moment calculation, braking torque distribution and electric motor torque reduction. the proposed second method - rb-lsc - is a simpler method than the ilsc system. in this method, electric motor torque is regulated according to the vehicle side slip error and/or the vehicle yaw rate error. the performances of the proposed methods are evaluated under severe road conditions and extreme maneuvers using the commercially available carsim vehicle dynamics software. the results show that the proposed control systems improve vehicle lateral stability significantly.
electrical_circuits	the accurate and reliable identification of damage in modern engineered structures is essential for timely corrective measures. vibration-based damage prediction has been studied extensively by virtue of its global damage detection ability and simplicity in practical implementation. however, due to noise and damping effects, the accuracy of this method is inhibited when direct peak detection (dpd) is utilized to determine resonant frequency shifts. this research investigates an alternative method to detect frequency shifts caused by structural damage based on the utilization of strongly nonlinear bifurcation phenomena in bistable electrical circuits coupled with piezoelectric transducers integrated with the structure. it is shown that frequency shift predictions by the proposed approach are significantly less susceptible to error than dpd when realistic noise and damping levels distort the shifting resonance peaks. as implemented alongside adaptive piezoelectric circuitry with tunable inductance, the new method yields damage location and severity identification that is significantly more robust and accurate than results obtained following the dpd approach.
state_space_representation	this paper presents an optimal method to tune the proportional, integral and derivative (pid) controller for a hydraulic turbine coupled with the corresponding transient droop compensator (tdc). the proposed methodology is based on the desired time response specification (dtrs) of the input guide vane servomotor that includes typical rate limiters and gain saturation in power plants. therefore, the problem consists of adjusting both the parameters of the controller and compensator such as the time response remains close to the specified one. to avoid suboptimal solutions at local minimum points, it is necessary to solve the resulting non linear problem in two steps: (i) firstly, solve a linear programming (lp) to determine the values of pid&tdc block using state space representation to match the input and output time responses specifications and (ii) determine the final values of the pid and tdc parameters using the previous results in a new non linear programming. the proposed methodology has presented the advantage of tuning the pid coordinated with the tdc spending low computational time. the results show that the performance of the method covers a wide range of operating conditions of the system. comparisons were also made with existing methods in the literature to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

operational_amplifier	a constant-gm, rail-to-rail operational amplifier circuit topology is presented in this paper. the amplifier input stage is realized using single nmos pair at 0.13 mu m bulk-cmos process technology. the overall gain variation is within the range of +/- 2.338% for the rail-to-rail common mode input range. the proposed design is able to reject the common mode input response with 115db of common mode rejection ratio (cmrr). high slew rate is achieved and the simulated value is +19/-43 (v/mu s) of an unity gain buffer op-amp at 5pf of cl. the variation in overall gm and gain are also simulated at different corner temperatures. the circuit simulation is done in tanner eda at 1.8v of power supply which dissipates the power of 6.1mw.
state_space_representation	high-frequency (hf) models of electrical motors and power converters are greatly important for electromagnetic compatibility characterization of electrical drives and for electromagnetic interference (emi) filter design. in this paper, an accurate and effective method for the characterization and tuning of hf models (150 khz-30 mhz) for induction motors has been proposed based on experimental measurements of the motor impedance. impedance measurements have been taken in three different configurations: between all the six winding terminals which are shorted and grounded; between the three input terminals which are shorted and grounded (common mode); and between one input terminal and the other two which are shorted (differential mode). once an hf motor model structure has been chosen and modeled using a state-space representation, its parameters have been tuned using genetic algorithm to match the real impedance in each corresponding configuration. comparison between the experimental impedance measurements and the model impedance estimate are shown for all the tested configurations, in order to validate the model within the frequency range of interest for emi.
electrical_network	more and more maritime applications as marine vessels and offshore platforms need an adaptive protection power system. however, the adaptive protection is yet to be implemented in the maritime sector. usually, the adaptive protection implies the existence of a central control unit that monitors the entire electrical network and changes the relay settings accordingly, but this approach is not adequate for the maritime power systems. this paper propose a decentralized adaptive protection method, where each protection relay is able to identify by itself the network status without the need of a central control unit. the new adaptive protection method is based on communication between the overcurrent relays and the equipment that could affect the protection system, such as circuit breakers and generators. using pscad, the proposed method is implemented in a test medium voltage maritime power system that possess some of the characteristics of the maritime applications, as variable generation and network reconfiguration.
analog_signal_processing	the paper aims to perform a comparative analysis regarding the testing results achieved on an experimental model of counter rotating wind turbine with a rated power of 1 kw for a wind velocity of 10 m/s. the experimental model is consisted of a system of two rotors which rotate in opposite directions - one rotor is rotating in clockwise direction and the other in counter-clockwise direction - and one unique electrical generator, which adds-up the rotation of both wind rotors. the ratio between the two diameters is 1.08, the up-wind rotor being slightly larger than the down-wind one. the experimental model is provided with a three-phase synchronous electric generator with counter rotating armatures, having the power of 1.6 kw, 3x24 v, at 750 rpm. this type of generator is characterized by a reduced size, increased rotational speed and no losses due to movement transmission. the experiments on the wind turbine system have been performed both in a wind tunnel as well as in situ, in a location nearby iasi city, romania, where the turbine has been installed. the paper focuses on investigating the operation of the system both in controlled test conditions and in real conditions, when wind changes its velocity and direction. in order to determine the effect of these variations, the wind turbine system has been tested at different wind velocities, up to 10.5 m/s in the wind tunnel and up to 8.7 m/s in free air stream. the in situ testing has been performed also in order to validate the results obtained on the experimental model of counter rotating wind turbine system within the wind tunnel. there has been noticed a good consistency between the two sets of experiments, resulting that the procedure is suitable to be further applied in designing a 10 kw wind turbine prototype.
state_space_representation	the adequate representation of states in the construction of intelligent agents is fundamental for allowing them to achieve a satisfactory performance, principally for those that actuate in a competitive environment that possesses a high state space. one particular type of representation that is very appropriate for these situations is the netfeaturemap, which describes by means of features the relevant aspects that are inherent to the environment where the agent actuates. in renowned intelligent agents, such features are manually selected, which certainly leads to inadequate choices. in this way, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a new approach, based on association rules, that automatically selects these features. under the intent of investigating the efficacy of such a proposal, the authors utilize the domain of checkers player agents as their study laboratory. the best performance of the association rules-based agents proves the efficacy of the present proposal.
electricity	compressed air energy storage technologies can improve the supply capacity and stability of the electricity grid, particularly when fluctuating renewable energies are massively connected. while incorporating the combined cooling, heating and power systems into compressed air energy storage could achieve stable operation as well as efficient energy utilization. in this paper, a novel combined cooling, heating and power based compressed air energy storage system is proposed. the system combines a gas engine, supplemental heat exchangers and an ammonia-water absorption refrigeration system. the design tradeoff between the thermodynamic and economic objectives, i.e., the overall exergy efficiency and the total specific cost of product, is investigated by an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm for the proposed combined system. it is found that, with an increase in the exergy efficiency, the total product unit cost is less affected in the beginning, while rises substantially afterwards. the best trade-off solution is selected with an overall exergy efficiency of 53.04% and a total product unit cost of 20.54 cent/kwh, respectively. the variation of decision variables with the exergy efficiency indicates that the compressor, turbine and heat exchanger preheating the inlet air of turbine are the key equipment to cost-effectively pursuit a higher exergy efficiency. it is also revealed by an exergoeconomic analysis that, for the best trade-off solution, the investment costs of the compressor and the two heat exchangers recovering compression heat and heating up compressed air for expansion should be reduced (particularly the latter), while the thermodynamic performance of the gas engine need to be improved significantly.

pid_controller	in order to ensure that a robotic hand can successfully grasp objects without damaging them, an active compliance control can be a very useful technique to provide a safe grasping. in particular, this paper establishes a direct force control for a 3-finger adaptive robot gripper by using a pid control. a modified fsr force sensor where a plastic cover is used to ensure the contacted force during grasping can be measured and recorded. a series of grasping tests were performed to observe the performance of pid control. the experimental results show that the pid control can be a simple and reliable control scheme to provide an active compliance control through direct force control. in addition, different compliance level is feasible particularly for a stiff spongy ball.
analog_signal_processing	the potential of electric power generation from marine tidal currents is enormous. tidal currents are being recognized as a resource to be exploited for the sustainable generation of electrical power. the high load factors resulting from the fluid properties and the predictable resource characteristics make marine currents particularly attractive for power generation and advantageous when compared to other renewable energies. moreover, international treaties related to climate control have triggered resurgence in development of renewable ocean energy technology. therefore, several demonstration projects in tidal power are scheduled to capture the tidal generated coastal currents. regarding this emerging and promising area of research, this paper reviews marine tidal power fundamental concepts and main projects around the world. it also report issues regarding electrical generator topologies associated to tidal turbines. moreover, attempts are made to highlight future issues so as to index some emerging technologies mainly according to relevant works that have been carried out on wind turbines and on ship propellers.

pid_controller	this paper concerns the dynamical decoupling and feed-forward control of magnetically-levitated planar actuators (mlpas) with moving coils when the moving stage 's center-of-mass (cm) deviates from the geometric center (gc). based on the direct wrench-current decoupling, the factors that affect the continuity of current are emphatically analyzed for a more stable current control, and the propulsion works at cm is converted at gc with newton-euler dynamic equation. by inverting the system dynamics, 6 degrees-of-freedom (dof) individual control is realized and the system is simplified from mimo to siso. based on the decoupling, an acceleration feed-forward controller with pid control is designed. by studying the coupling parameter relating to feed-forward inputs and white noise, the acceleration amplification coefficient is achieved and the pid parameters will be optimized based on comparing the actual variance with the minimum achievable variance. last, the simulation results indicate that the feed-forward compound controller applying to mlpas system has a better performance than the general pid controller.

electricity	utility sector reform spread across the developing world in the 1980s and 1990s. in egypt, as in many cases, the pace and nature of reform has been challenged by a state-owned national incumbent. however, in the egyptian telecommunications sector, rapid growth in the cellular market has overtaken the archaic fixed-line system. hence, the national monopoly provider, telecom egypt (te), has been stripped of its market power as the market diversified. the implemented public sector reform and privatization placed efficiency pressures on te resulting in improved outcomes for a range of stakeholders, consumers, workers, and the government, including reduced prices, increased access, and improved service quality. this experience offers lessons for policy makers and researchers about liberalization in the face of entrenched state interests. however, there are nuances in the findings relating to market type, that is, fixed-line versus cellular, residential versus non-residential, and national versus international. despite attempted improvements, direct competition in its retail market has led to deterioration in te 's financial performance, although this has been partially offset by its monopoly supply of an essential input and a degree of protection provided by the regulator sympathetic to te. the evidence from this case study supports the concept of a staggered introduction of competition. however, protecting inefficient market insiders, be it firms or workers, is always at the expense of potentially more efficient outsiders.

electricity	to find a balance between food and energy security, this research presents the design of an energy self-sufficient farm in electricity, heat and bioethanol, which is produced by energy crops and agricultural residues. the farm proposed is evaluated by two models: land optimization and cost optimization. due to the food-fuel debate over land and the detriment of food security, this research proposes utilizing the current abandoned land and increasing the food self-sufficiency ratio (fssr) of the crops analyzed (rice, wheat and maize). the farm is optimized for several food and fuel demands, with a maximum farm unit size of 100 ha. the result is a myriad of farms of different sizes, each optimized for a certain demand. subsequently, the amount and variety of such farms are optimized maximizing the food and fuel produced for each city of the case study (miyagi prefecture, japan). the results suggest that the establishment of energy self-sufficient farms in the abandoned land can stimulate the biofuel industry and increase food security simultaneously. the fssr of maize and wheat can be improved in approximately 10-25 and 7-9 %, respectively. the estimated bioethanol potential is 3.2-3.8 ml. additionally, a surplus of electricity and heat, approximately 61-65 gwh and 60-165 mj, respectively, is obtained. as the land optimization model proposed is sensitive to crop yields, a simultaneous evaluation is recommended. the results also suggest that the farms must be larger than 8 ha to achieve self-sufficiency; therefore, the policies involved need further evaluation.
operational_amplifier	in this paper, a new pulse width modulation (pwm) converter is proposed. this structure converts the analog input signal to a pwm waveform using only inverters/charge-pumps in combination with passive elements. thus, the proposed pwm converter does not need any operational amplifier. the added feedback path current can be used to adjust the required duty-cycle of the pwm conversion based on the dynamic range of the input signal. the behavior of the proposed pwm converter is formulated and simulated in a 0.13 mu m cmos technology. from the simulation results, the proposed pwm converter achieves 74db linearity and draws only 1.0ma at 500mhz from 1.0v supply in a 0.13 mu m process.
electrical_circuits	this paper proposes a new method of decoupling and subdividing electrical circuits, containing power-electronics devices, in order to achieve fast and accurate real-time simulation. in this technique, each state variable can be discretized using different discretization methods. combining implicit and explicit ode solvers, state-space equations are decoupled while remaining accurate and stable. unlike most traditional decoupling techniques previously proposed, the proposed one does not require artificial delay or supplementary states to be added in order to decouple the system. furthermore, this technique is meant to be implemented with commercially available simulation software. by doing so, a large and complex circuit containing several hundreds of state variables can be easily and accurately simulated with minor modification to the existing models. finally, stability and accuracy of the proposed technique are thoroughly demonstrated in a numerical example during steady state and under faulty conditions.

microcontroller	by the deployment of internet of things, embedded systems using microcontroller are nowadays under threats through the network and incorporating security measure to the systems is highly required. unfortunately, microcontrollers are not so powerful enough to execute standard security programs and need light-weight, high-speed and secure cryptographic libraries. in this paper, we port nacl cryptographic library to arm cortex-m0(m0+) microcontroller, where we put much effort in fast and secure implementation. through the evaluation we show that the implementation achieves about 3 times faster than avr nacl result and reduce half of the code size.
analog_signal_processing	direct drive wave energy converters are characterized by a direct conversion of the wave energy into electricity with no intermediate mechanical conversion system. for this reason, optimization methods for maximizing the absorbed power have to be designed for acting on the electrical generator. besides, this type of system requires power electronics to be connected to the grid. this paper evaluates three different current control strategies applied to a boost-rectifier in the ac-dc stage as part of an optimization method. the system is implemented and simulated in matlab/simulink with real random waves. in direct drive wave energy conversion, unlike the original application of these controllers, the input electrical power is highly variable, both in amplitude and frequency. the controllers are assessed under these conditions and their advantages and disadvantages are presented.
lorentz_force_law	we consider the nonlinear klein-gordon-maxwell system derived from the lagrangian integral(-1/4 f(mu nu)f(mu nu) + 1/2- nu(phi) - ea(mu)j(mu)(b)) on four-dimensional minkowski space-time, where phi is a complex scalar field and f(mu nu) = partial derivative(mu)a(nu) - partial derivative(nu)a(mu) is the electromagnetic field. for appropriate nonlinear potentials nu, the system admits soliton solutions which are gauge invariant generalizations of the non-topological solitons introduced and studied by lee and collaborators for pure complex scalar fields. in this article, we develop a rigorous dynamical perturbation theory for these solitons in the small e limit, where e is the electromagnetic coupling constant. the main theorems assert the long time stability of the solitons with respect to perturbation by an external electromagnetic field produced by the background current j(b), and compute their effective dynamics to o(e). the effective dynamical equation is the equation of motion for a relativistic particle acted on by the lorentz force law familiar from classical electrodynamics. the theorems are valid in a scaling regime in which the external electromagnetic fields are o(1), but vary slowly over space-time scales of o(1/delta), and delta = e(1-k) for k is an element of (0, 1/2) as e ->0. we work entirely in the energy norm, and the approximation is controlled in this norm for times of o(1/e).
system_identification	the objective of structural model updating is to reduce inherent modeling errors in finite element (fe) models due to simplifications, idealized connections, and uncertainties of material properties. updated fe models, which have less discrepancies with real structures, give more precise predictions of dynamic behaviors for future analyses. however, model updating becomes more difficult when applied to civil structures with a large number of structural components and complicated connections. in this paper, a full-scale fe model of a major long-span bridge has been updated for improved consistency with real measured data. two methods are applied to improve the model updating process. the first method focuses on improving the agreement of the updated mode shapes with the measured data. a nonlinear inequality constraint equation is used to an optimization procedure, providing the capability to regulate updated mode shapes to remain within reasonable agreements with those observed. an interior point algorithm deals with nonlinearity in the objective function and constraints. the second method finds very efficient updating parameters in a more systematic way. the selection of updating parameters in fe models is essential to have a successful updating result because the parameters are directly related to the modal properties of dynamic systems. an in-depth sensitivity analysis is carried out in an effort to precisely understand the effects of physical parameters in the fe model on natural frequencies. based on the sensitivity analysis, cluster analysis is conducted to find a very efficient set of updating parameters.

pid_controller	in this paper, a novel hybrid many optimizing liaisons (mol) and teaching-learning based optimization(tlbo) i.e. mol-tlbo based optimization of integrated hybrid renewable energy sources (ihres) is proposed for techno-economic-socio analysis. ihres consists of pv, wind turbine, battery storage banks and diesel generator. the methodology was constructed by using meteorological data from renewable energy laboratory of electrical engineering department, manit, bhopal situated in madhya pradesh, india. optimal sizing of ihres is done on the basis of solar irradiation, wind speed, demand load, reliability index, loss of load probability (lolp) and co2 emission through diesel generator. three different crystalline silicon pv modules are considered: ase-300(mi-si based efg), kyocera-120(mc-si based wafer) and astro-power ap-120(thin-film si). results show that ap-120 gives better result as compared with other two for pv-wind-battery-dg combination. annual cost of the system (acs) is evaluated by using the proposed hybrid mol and tlbo (mol-tlbo) algorithm. supremacy of the suggested mol-tlbo hybrid method for optimal sizing of hybrid system is proved by comparing the results with other optimization techniques i.e. tlbo, itlbo, pso, mol and sga. finally it is seen that mol-tlbo based techno-economicsocio analysis for ihres exhibit superior performance and fast as compared to sga, pso, tlbo, itlbo and mol.

pid_controller	this paper focuses on the stabilization problem for the floated inertial platform experimental system. based on the moment analysis of the platform and the mode of the main moment, the dynamic equation of the stabilized platform rotating around its center is derived in consideration of some disturbances. to solve the system model uncertainty, measurement noise, three-axial coupling and unmodeled disturbances, the auto disturbances rejection controller (adrc) is proposed. in addition, the time delay problem, caused by system wireless transmission, is addressed using an improved adrc controller. three-axial stabilized control system model of floated inertial platform experimental system is built by matlab/simulink. simulations indicate that the adrc controller is better than the traditional pid controller. this controller can stabilize the platform more quickly, more accurately, more robustly and without overshoot. improved smith predicting adrc controller can eliminate the influence of transmission time delay of the system to realize the stability control real-timely. by virtue of this improved controller, this platform can provide an effective inertial reference for the vehicle.

digital_control	this paper introduces a new voltage regulator module (vrm) that merges a highly efficient switched-inductor converter as the main unit with a load-side switched-capacitor-based converter to assist during load transient events. the resulting hybrid-vrm exhibits improved dynamic performance for both loading and unloading transient events, while maintaining a compact design with reduced output capacitance and lower components stress. the hybrid controller that has been developed allows operation that is based on output voltage measurement alone, further reducing the circuit complexity. a power processing efficiency analysis that has been carried out shows efficiency improvement in favor of the hybrid-vrm when compared to time-optimal control under varying load conditions. the operation of the vrm is verified on a 20-w, 12v-to-1.5-v prototype with peak power conversion efficiency of 93%, demonstrating near-ideal transient recovery.
control_engineering	millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing impairment. noise exposure can cause several risks for the safety and health of workers, however the condition can be prevented by preventive measures. in many countries hearing loss prevention programmes (hlpps) are mandatory, which are considered an effective means to prevent noise induced hearing loss. the awareness of the industry to keep noise control engineering programs, training programs inserted into an effective hearing conservation program is essential to protect the worker. the objective of this work is search about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions about hearing education programs, hearing protection devices and workers noise perception. this paper presents the systematic review about this topic, was reports in order to identify papers published in constant journals on databases with appropriate keywords combinations. it was conclude that studies about conservation program evaluation have been used in relatively few studies, mainly the relation with the effects of these programs on employees' health and safety.
digital_control	while digital control has achieved success in various power electronic applications, data conversion remains a primary challenge and limitation compared to conventional analog methods. in particular, tradeoffs among resolution, switching frequency, and power consumption of digital pulse-width modulation (dpwm) blocks limit performance, particularly in high conversion-ratio applications. analog-digital conversion is also challenging when line-voltage feedforward techniques are applied as it requires high speed, accuracy, and in some cases exposure to voltages exceeding the rating of deep-submicron cmos technologies. this work explores tradeoffs in power consumption of counter/delay-line dpwm circuits, implemented in cmos, and derives an optimization method to segment the bit allocation among the counter and delay line components. a method for line-voltage feedforward is also presented that can instrument and quantize transients on the supply voltage without direct exposure of low voltage devices to the supply. an automotive 48v:7v application is considered.
signal-flow_graph	star-delta transformations are popular in electrical engineering. of late they have also been tried in reliability analysis. techniques are presented here to transform a star (delta) to a delta (star) in a signal flow graph. this allows us to simplify some non-series-parallel graphs using a series parallel framework. unlike the case of electrical circuits, these transformations are not always possible. it is shown that a star-to-delta transformation is always possible. but a delta can be transformed into a star if and only if a certain loop condition is satisfied. an important advantage of these techniques is that they can be used even when there are directed loops, whereas this is not the case with standard series parallel techniques.
electrical_network	distribution systems are naturally unbalanced as a consequence of unbalanced loads and the electrical network itself, where the use of single-phase or two-phase sections is not uncommon. in addition, a detailed representation of a typical distribution system can have tens of thousands of nodes, depending on the area selected for study and whether a three-phase representation is employed. this contrasts with transmission systems, where typical sizes in terms of number of nodes are much smaller and where a balanced (single-phase) representation is sufficient in most situations. thus, transmission and distribution systems have traditionally been studied separately, but this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate for various reasons. this paper then proposes a methodology that integrates transmission and distribution systems into a common electrical model. at the core of the methodology there are 1) single-and three-phase models for each component (branches, transformers, loads, etc.) and 2) interchangeable balanced and unbalanced network equivalents that allow for analyzing specific areas of a given complete network. potential gains brought about by the proposed methodology are illustrated through its application in a real-world electric system.
analog_signal_processing	the thermo-acoustic generators offer a unique means of converting thermal energy into mechanical energy without any moving parts and without fluid circulation. they are comparable to the stirling engine with the advantage of much greater simplicity. they are therefore natural candidates for special uses where interventions are limited. the problem to solve is transforming the mechanical energy into electrical energy. mhd generators offer excellent opportunities in this area, particularly by using the mechanisms of induction. the work concerns the combination of a thermo-acoustic generator with an induction generator of a new concept for obtaining electric current with adjustable voltage and current strength, delivered at the thermo-acoustic wave frequency. the system has been subjected to numerical simulation. however, an experimental program is being studied in collaboration with industrial and academic partners. the exploitation of the process by using a solar collector (parabolic or cylindrically-parabolic) is envisaged with the aim to produce electricity, for example, in isolate villages (c) 2010 published by elsevier ltd. selection and/or peer-review under responsibility of [name organizer]
microcontroller	monitoring vital signs, which include breathing, is often used both in clinical practice and at home. the paper presents a novel low power system that can be used to control breathing frequency and detect apnea, which uses a condenser-type humidity sensor supplied with input bias current of an operational amplifier. the new configuration of the sensor, which compensates for the amplifier saturation state during the exhalation phase, increases breath detection effectiveness. the presented system is energy efficient, consumes approx. 50 mu a and operates over a wide range of supply voltages, 1.8 divided by 18 v dc. it enables to detect even very weak breathing. the concept of the integrated system has also been presented. this system can work directly with digital circuits without converting the electric signal. the presented system is characterized by a very simple construction and offers a new solution both in the field of sensor technology and for the use of operational amplifiers.

control_engineering	absolute stability attracted much attention in the 1960s. several stability conditions for loops with slope restricted nonlinearities were developed. results such as the circle criterion and the popov criterion form part of the core curriculum for students of control. moreover, the equivalence of results obtained by different techniques, specifically lyapunov and popov 's stability theories, led to one of the most important results in control engineering: the kyp lemma. for luryel systems this work culminated in the class of multipliers proposed by o'shea in 1966 and formalized by zames and falb in 1968. the superiority of this class was quickly and widely accepted. nevertheless the result was ahead of its time as graphical techniques were preferred in the absence of readily available computer optimization. its first systematic use as a stability criterion came 20 years after the initial proposal of the class. a further 20 years have been required to develop a proper understanding of the different techniques that can be used. in this long gestation some significant knowledge has been overlooked or forgotten. most significantly, o'shea 's contribution and insight is no longer acknowledged; his papers are barely cited despite his original parameterization of the class. this tutorial paper aims to provide a clear and comprehensive introduction to the topic from a user 's viewpoint. we review the main results: the stability theory, the properties of the multipliers (including their phase properties, phase-equivalence results and the issues associated with causality), and convex searches. for clarity of exposition we restrict our attention to continuous time multipliers for single-input single-output results. nevertheless we include several recent significant developments by the authors and others. we illustrate all these topics using an example proposed by o'shea himself.

analog_signal_processing	a novel topology suitable for emulating fractional-order capacitors and inductors using current excitation is achieved using a fractional-order differentiator/integrator block and appropriately configured operational transconductance amplifiers. the scheme is capable of emulating both fractional-order capacitors and fractional-order inductors without any modifications to its structure. this implementation allows for electronic tuning of the order, capacitance/inductance, and bandwidth of operation by modification of only the bias current. post-layout simulation results of the impedance magnitude and phase confirm the correct emulated behavior of both fractional-order capacitors and inductors. two examples highlight the applications of this topology in i) realizing a fractional-order bandpass filter and ii) emulating a cole impedance model for biological applications. for both examples the characteristics of each circuit are validated in simulation.

state_space_representation	this note addresses parameterization issues of nonlinear observer-based fault detection (fd) systems which are composed of a residual generator, a residual evaluator and a threshold. our study consists of two steps. in the first step, with the aid of nonlinear factorization and input-output operator techniques, we prove that any stable residual generator can be parameterized by a cascade connection of the process kernel representation and a post-filter that represents the parameter system. in the second step, based on the state-space representation of the parameterized residual generators, we investigate the so-called l-infinity- and l-2-classes of observer-based fd systems. this leads to the parameterization of the threshold settings for both classes of fd systems and, associated with them, to the characterization of the existence conditions.
digital_control	the development of a non-human primate (nhp) model of spinal cord injury (sci) based on mechanical and computational modeling is described. we scaled up from a rodent model to a larger primate model using a highly controllable, friction-free, electronically-driven actuator to generate unilateral c6-c7 spinal cord injuries. graded contusion lesions with varying degrees of functional recovery, depending upon pre-set impact parameters, were produced in nine nhps. protocols and pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (mri) were used to optimize the predictability of outcomes by matching impact protocols to the size of each animal 's spinal canal, cord, and cerebrospinal fluid space. post-operative mri confirmed lesion placement and provided information on lesion volume and spread for comparison with histological measures. we evaluated the relationships between impact parameters, lesion measures, and behavioral outcomes, and confirmed that these relationships were consistent with our previous studies in the rat. in addition to providing multiple univariate outcome measures, we also developed an integrated outcome metric describing the multivariate cervical sci syndrome. impacts at the higher ranges of peak force produced highly lateralized and enduring deficits in multiple measures of forelimb and hand function, while lower energy impacts produced early weakness followed by substantial recovery but enduring deficits in fine digital control (e.g., pincer grasp). this model provides a clinically relevant system in which to evaluate the safety and, potentially, the efficacy of candidate translational therapies.

analog_signal_processing	this paper proposes a spiral-shaped dispersive delay structure (spiral-dds) composed of vertically stacked spiral coils and vertical vias. this all-pass network architecture can produce a large group delay peak at a certain frequency in a few ghz range. basic performance of the spiral-dds are studied theoretically, and the group delay with more than 6 ns was successfully generated by a compact multilayered architecture with dimensions of 6.0 x 6.0 x 1.18 mm (3). this paper also reports that the most of losses occurred in dds comes from conductor loss, not from dielectric loss.
electrical_circuits	the paper deals with a technique for the simulation of higher-order electrical circuits with parameters varying randomly. the principle consists in the utilization of the theory of stochastic differential equations (sde), namely the vector form of the ordinary sdes. random changes of both excitation voltage and some parameters of passive circuit elements are considered, and circuit responses are analyzed. the voltage and/or current responses are computed and represented in the form of the sample means accompanied by their confidence intervals to provide reliable estimates. the method is applied to analyze responses of the circuit models of optional orders, specially those consisting of a cascade connection of the rlgc networks. to develop the model equations the state-variable method is used, afterwards a corresponding vector sde is formulated and a stochastic euler numerical method applied. to verify the results the deterministic responses are also computed by the help of the pspice simulator or the numerical inverse laplace transforms (nilt) procedure in matlab (r), while removing random terms from the circuit model.
analog_signal_processing	the majority of wind turbines currently in operation have the conventional danish concept design-that is, the three-bladed rotor of such turbines is indirectly coupled with an electrical generator via a gearbox. recent technological developments have enabled direct drive wind turbines to become economically feasible. potentially, direct drive wind turbines may enjoy higher levels of availability due to the removal of the gearbox from the design. however, this is only a theory: so far not substantiated by detailed analytic calculation. by providing such a calculation, this paper enables us to quantitatively evaluate technical and economic merits of direct drive and gearbox-driven wind turbines.
pid_controller	a control method for improving tracking performance with respect to a reference trajectory has been developed. the proposed control system has an inner/outer control structure. the inner control system is the existing control system based on a conventional pid controller, which is designed in advance and is independent of the outer control system. in order to improve tracking performance, the outer control system is designed based on optimal preview control theory and is added to the outside of the inner control system. a polynomial trajectory is used as the reference trajectory and is fed to the outer control system. the reference trajectory is modified online to minimize tracking error. the modified reference trajectory is derived as a control input signal from the outer control system and is fed to the inner control system. the effectiveness of the proposed control method is confirmed using numerical simulations in a benchmark problem for hard disk drives (hdds).
pid_controller	being complex, non-linear and coupled system, the robotic manipulator cannot be effectively controlled using classical proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller. to enhance the effectiveness of the conventional pid controller for the nonlinear and uncertain systems, gains of the pid controller should be conservatively tuned and should adapt to the process parameter variations. in this work, a mix locally recurrent neural network (mlrnn) architecture is investigated to mimic a conventional pid controller which consists of at most three hidden nodes which act as proportional, integral and derivative node. the gains of the mix locally recurrent neural network based pid (mlrnnpid) controller scheme are initialized with a newly developed cuckoo search algorithm (csa) based optimization method rather than assuming randomly. a sequential learning based least square algorithm is then investigated for the online adaptation of the gains of mlrnnpid controller. the performance of the proposed controller scheme is tested against the plant parameters uncertainties and external disturbances for both links of the two link robotic manipulator with variable payload (tl-rmwvp). the stability of the proposed controller is analyzed using lyapunov stability criteria. a performance comparison is carried out among mlrnnpid controller, csa optimized nnpid (optnnpid) controller and csa optimized conventional pid (optpid) controller in order to establish the effectiveness of the mlrnnpid controller.

system_identification	recently, online input selection has gained an increasing attention in evolving fuzzy models. in this paper, we proposed a new evolving fuzzy system referred to as evolving heterogeneous fuzzy inference system (ehfis), which can simultaneously perform local input selection and system identification in an evolving and integrative manner. the introduced ehfis is structured by some fuzzy rules with different effective input variables. this was achieved through inclusion of some parameters (local input selectors) in the structure of the takagi-sugeno system. an online learning algorithm is proposed to identify the ehfis, where 1) the premise parameter learning and rule evolution take place with the usage of an incremental and evolving clustering for partitioning the data space; 2) a local input selection strategy based on switching to a neighboring model is adopted, and then, all fuzzy rules with the same input structure form a new category; and 3) for each category, the parameters of linear models, in consequent parts, are updated by weighted recursive fuzzily weighted least-squares estimator. the performance of the proposed ehfis is evaluated and compared through several simulations on hand made as well as real-life datasets.

signal-flow_graph	in this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for computing the 2-d discrete cosine transform (dct). first, we arrange the input data matrix in a certain order. second, we formulate the output data matrix to a block-structured matrix-vector multiplication, and show that the block-structured matrix has the same properties as the 1-d dct kernel matrix. therefore, the 2-d dct problem is reduced to the 1-d dct problem. we thus can provide a procedure for computing the 2-d dct which is similar to that of the 1-d dct. the primary appeal of this algorithm lies not only in its low computational cost but also in its regular structure as the transform size increases.

microcontroller	gait analysis using wearable wireless sensors can be an economical, convenient and effective way to provide diagnostic and clinical information for various health-related issues. in this work, our custom designed low-cost wireless gait analysis sensor that contains a basic inertial measurement unit (imu) was used to collect the gait data for four patients diagnosed with balance disorders and additionally three normal subjects, each performing the dynamic gait index (dgi) tests while wearing the custom wireless gait analysis sensor (wgas). the small wgas includes a tri-axial accelerometer integrated circuit (ic), two gyroscopes ics and a texas instruments (ti) msp430 microcontroller and is worn by each subject at the t4 position during the dgi tests. the raw gait data are wirelessly transmitted from the wgas to a near-by pc for real-time gait data collection and analysis. in order to perform successful classification of patients vs. normal subjects, we used several different classification algorithms, such as the back propagation artificial neural network (bp-ann), support vector machine (svm), k-nearest neighbors (knn) and binary decision trees (bdt), based on features extracted from the raw gait data of the gyroscopes and accelerometers. when the range was used as the input feature, the overall classification accuracy obtained is 100% with bp-ann, 98% with svm, 96% with knn and 94% using bdt. similar high classification accuracy results were also achieved when the standard deviation or other values were used as input features to these classifiers. these results show that gait data collected from our very low-cost wearable wireless gait sensor can effectively differentiate patients with balance disorders from normal subjects in real time using various classifiers, the success of which may eventually lead to accurate and objective diagnosis of abnormal human gaits and their underlying etiologies in the future, as more patient data are being collected.

electricity	in order to attain emissions reduction targets to improve air quality and reduce global warming, electric vehicles (evs) arise as alternatives to conventional vehicles fueled by fossil fuels. in this context, this work presents a comparative study between an ev and its conventional version, a medium-duty, diesel engine powered vehicle, from road tests following a standard cycle in urban driving conditions. the performance parameters evaluated are ev electric energy consumption and carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from electricity generation and, for the conventional vehicle, exhaust co2 emissions and energy consumption calculated from fuel consumption and heating value. five scenarios were built to conduct an economic viability study in terms of payback and net present value (npv). considering the conditions applied, the results from the environmental analysis showed that co2 emissions from the ev was 4.6 times lower in comparison with the diesel vehicle. on the other hand, the economic analysis revealed that the viability of the ev is compromised, mainly due to the imported parts with unfavorably high exchange rates. in the best scenario and not considering revenue from commercial application, the calculated payback period of the ev is 13 years of operation.

voltage_law	this letter presents an improved backward/forward sweep algorithm for three-phase load-flow analysis of radial distribution systems. in the backward sweep, kirchhoff 's current law and kirchhoff 's voltage law are used to calculate the upstream bus voltage of each line or a transformer branch. then, the linear proportional principle is adopted to find the ratios of the real and imaginary components of the specified voltage to those of the calculated voltage at the substation bus. in the forward sweep, the voltage at each downstream bus is then updated by the real and imaginary components of the calculated bus voltage multiplying with the corresponding ratio. the procedure stops after the mismatch of the calculated and the specified voltages at the substation is less than a convergence tolerance. the proposed algorithm is tested with three ieee benchmark distribution systems. results show that the algorithm is accurate and computationally efficient in comparing with two other commonly used methods.

voltage_law	planar nanoscopic contacts are observed to undergo early electrical breakdown. the authors show that the cause is high field emission capable of triggering electromigration. the phenomenon is well described by an empirical current-voltage law, well different from that usually found in nonflat field emitters; this is attributed to the particular geometry of the contacts. although the mathematical form of the law is always the same, the intensity of breakdown current changes from sample to sample, ranging over several orders of magnitude; this is explained by the nanoscopic roughness of the emitting surfaces. they also show that the occurrence of breakdown may be dependent on the polarity of the applied voltage.
digital_control	digital stabilization of unstable equilibria of linear systems may lead to small amplitude stochastic-like oscillations. we show that these vibrations can be related to a deterministic chaotic dynamics induced by sampling and quantization. a detailed analytical proof of chaos is presented for the case of a pd controlled oscillator: it is shown that there exists a finite attracting domain in the phase-space, the largest lyapunov exponent is positive and the existence of a smale horseshoe is also pointed out. the corresponding two-dimensional micro-chaos map is a multi-baker map, i.e. it consists of a finite series of baker 's maps.
control_engineering	conventional integer order proportional integral derivative (iopid) are the workhorse for the control of almost 90% of the industrial processes due to its structural simplicity. with the application of fractional calculus in the field of control engineering, fractional order (fo) pid controllers are gaining popularity since it requires a slight modification of the integer order pid controller. tuning of the integer order pid controller parameters are by well known techniques like ziegler nichols method, cohen coon method, etc mostly time domain based and few frequency techniques are also available. in the present research work, an attempt has been made to tune the fopi controller using frequency domain specifications. frequency domain specifications considered for the design includes the phase margin specification, gain crossover frequency specification and robustness to gain variations. the proposed control schemes are applied to three interacting tank process represented as third order system and verified under servo, regulatory, servo-regulatory response and robustness conditions. comparison of the time domain performance indices are performed to guarantee the superiority of the proposed scheme
electric_motor	this paper discusses the development of an energy management and supervisory control system (ems) for a hybrid electric vehicle (hev). it is built on national instruments' compactrio embedded controller and labview real-time software platform. the ems functions as the primary vehicle controller whose objective is to achieve optimal operation of the hybrid propulsion system-reduced fuel consumption and selfsustaining energy storage, since the vehicle is a non-plug-in hybrid. the hev derives its propulsion power from two sources -an internal combustion engine (ice) and an electric motor. the ems receives inputs of throttle position, vehicle speed, engine rpm and battery state of charge (soc). based on a certain control algorithm, it then determines the two sources' operation status and power distribution, and charging of battery pack. a graphical driver interface is implemented on a tablet pc with a tcp/ip connection to the ems controller. a labview-based interface appears on a dynamically-controllable html page hosted by the web server function of the compactrio, enabling the driver to monitor and override control of the hybrid vehicle.

system_identification	complexity pursuit (cp) has recently been proposed as an elegant and simple solution to blindly (i.e. without measuring the inputs) separate the modal contributions in the vibration responses of a structure. this potentially finds considerable interest in operational modal analysis and related applications. this paper analyses the theoretical ins and outs of the method. it also revises its physical interpretation in the modal analysis context. cp is found to separate components which are the least dispersive (i.e. invariant under linear filtering), a property that well characterizes the modal responses of lightly damped systems. however, it is also found to suffer from the same limitations as other blind source separation methods used in the state-ofthe-art, namely the difficulty to separate strongly coupled modes and to identify complex mode shapes. finally a generalization of cp is proposed which intends to widen its applicability. interestingly, the generalized crep happens to include the well-known sobi algorithm as a particular case.
electricity	recent forecasts suggest that african countries must triple their current electricity generation by 2030. our multicriteria assessment of wind and solar potential for large regions of africa shows how economically competitive and low-environmental-impact renewable resources can significantly contribute to meeting this demand. we created the multicriteria analysis for planning renewable energy (mapre) framework to map and characterize solar and wind energy zones in 21 countries in the southern african power pool (sapp) and the eastern africa power pool (eapp) and find that potential is several times greater than demand in many countries. significant fractions of demand can be quickly served with ""no-regrets"" options-or zones that are low-cost, low-environmental impact, and highly accessible. because no-regrets options are spatially heterogeneous, international interconnections are necessary to help achieve low-carbon development for the region as a whole, and interconnections that support the best renewable options may differ from those planned for hydropower expansion. additionally, interconnections and selecting wind sites to match demand reduce the need for sapp-wide conventional generation capacity by 9.5% in a high-wind scenario, resulting in a 6-20% cost savings, depending on the avoided conventional technology. strategic selection of low-impact and accessible zones is more cost effective with interconnections compared with solutions without interconnections. overall results are robust to multiple load growth scenarios. together, results show that multicriteria site selection and deliberate planning of interconnections may significantly increase the economic and environmental competitiveness of renewable alternatives relative to conventional generation.
analog_signal_processing	the paper presents a detailed numerical model of the dynamic behaviour of a francis turbine installed in a hydroelectric plant. the model considers in detail the francis turbine with all the electromechanical subsystems, such as the main speed governor, the controller and the servo actuator of the turbine distributor, and the electrical generator. in particular, it reproduces the effects of pipeline elasticity in the penstock, the water inertia and the water compressibility on the turbine behaviour. the dynamics of the surge tank on low frequency pressure waves is also modelled together with the main governor speed loop and the position controllers of the distributor actuator and of the hydraulic electrovalve. model validation has been made by means of experimental data of a 75 mw-470 m hydraulic head-francis turbine acquired during some starting tests after a partial revamping, which also involved the control system of the distributor.

electrical_network	this paper introduces a simultaneous state and topology estimation method able to process both conventional (scada) and synchrophasor measurements. it is devised to extract from the analog measurements not only estimates for the state variables, but also information concerning the underlying network topology. this can be accomplished by representing selected parts of the electrical network at bus section level, and by using a specialized, multiobjective optimization framework to formulate the joint estimation problem. the multiobjective criterion comprises both the familiar weighted least squares term and an additional least absolute value component that models switching branch statuses. the proposed approach can be seen as a validation step for the outcome produced by network processors, thereby preventing the occurrence of topology errors. the results presented in this paper show that the joint estimation approach can be extended to allow phasor measurement processing capability, and that the whole scheme can draw significant benefits from such an extension.
digital_control	it is shown that the problem of evaluation of states both object and controller arises at digital control. in multi-circuit embedded systems time intervals of residence of system in any state depends on both time complexity of control algorithm and dispatching discipline. two simplest disciplines, of most common use are investigated: the cyclic dispatching and foreground (quasi-stochastic) one. with use the semi-markov process as fundamental theory, models of functioning of control programs under investigated dispatching disciplines are worked out. mathematical relationships for time of return to any state of semi-markov process and time between switches are obtained. the parameters obtained are essential for working out of efficient regimes of data processing in embedded systems.
microcontroller	visual techniques for qualitative assessment of roads, which rank the roads either good or not, have been widely used by the international confederation of transport. although there are quantitative techniques, such as iri (international index roughness), the use of these techniques involves a higher cost technique compared to the visual one due to the fact that there is a need of special and quite expensive equipment. in this work we developed a new quantitative indicator of roads able to evaluate and compare them in terms of its surface quality without relying on visual analysis. a low-cost acquisition system based on an analog 3-axis accelerometer and a microcontroller was developed. also, it was developed an algorithm able to evaluate and rank the road on a scale ranging from 0 to 5. two roads visually rated as good and bad were used as references. it was tested 3 different types of roads, with or without holes. both tests were conducted with a vehicle running at 40, 50 and 60 km/h. the results showed that the greater the amount of holes or unevenness the worst the quality indicator and that this depends on the speed of the vehicle. it was concluded that a quantitative analysis of road might be automatically done by using a low cost measuring system.
electric_motor	this paper presents a method of friction compensation for a linear electric motor in a model in the loop suspension test rig. the suspension consists of a numerically modeled spring and damper, with inputs of suspension motion. the linear motor is force controlled using a force sensor to track the output of the numerical model. the method uses a coulomb friction model and applies a feedforward step signal when velocity zero crossing occurs. velocity zero crossing estimation is achieved using an algorithm based on measured feedback velocity and force. experimental results indicate reduction of force tracking error caused by coulomb friction leading to improved test rig accuracy.
pid_controller	in this paper, an enhanced genetic algorithm (ega) based proportional integral-derivative (pid) controller is presented for control of nonlinear dynamic process. in ega, the crossover and elite offspring are optimized using ant colony optimization (aco) which improves the convergence characteristics and optimization capabilities of traditional genetic algorithm (ga).the proposed algorithm is implemented for closed loop control of continuous stirred tank reactor (cstr) process. the performance of the proposed scheme is validated through the simulation results and by comparing with the conventional counterparts. the integral performance criteria viz., integral square error (ise), integral absolute error (iae), integral time weighted absolute error (itae) of the ega implemented cstr system revealed a reduction of ise equal to 1.5704e-4 at 50-150 sampling interval when compared to conventional ga. the results show that, ega based nonlinear pid is more suitable for servo and regulatory operations.
electrical_circuits	smart textiles have become a dominant trend in future textiles development, especially wearable electronics. however, electronic garment designs often look more 'technical' than 'textile', which is reflected in the slow growth of the market. therefore, a design approach is proposed to design the conductive paths of electric stimulation garments in three steps: modelling, division and conquer, and pattern refinement to enhance the aesthetics. a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens) knitwear garment with a refined conductive network was developed and evaluated. the output waveforms and spectrums of the resulting tens knitwear are similar to those of tens signals. the resistance variations are smaller than 16 per cent after optimization, which is largely due to truncation and deformation. this method could provide a feasible and systematic approach to the design of electric stimulation textiles by using conductive fabrics to meet the requirements of both functionality and aesthetics.
operational_amplifier	background: electroencephalography (eeg) is still a widely used imaging tool that combines high temporal resolution with a relatively low cost. ag/agcl metal electrodes have been the gold standard for non-invasively monitoring electrical brain activity. although reliable, these electrodes have multiple drawbacks: they suffer from noise, such as offset potential drift, and usability issues, for example, difficult skin preparation and cross-coupling of adjacent electrodes. new method: in order to tackle these issues a prototype electric potential sensor (eps) device based on an auto-zero operational amplifier was developed and evaluated. the eps is a novel active ultrahigh impedance capacitively coupled sensor. the absence of 1/f noise makes the eps ideal for use with signal frequencies of similar to 10 hz or less. a comprehensive study was undertaken to compare neural signals recorded by the eps with a standard commercial eeg system. results: quantitatively, highly similar signals were observed between the eps and eeg sensors for both free running and evoked brain activity with cross correlations of higher than 0.9 between the eps and a standard benchmark eeg system. comparison with existing method(s): these studies comprised measurements of both free running eeg and event related potentials (erps) from a commercial eeg system and eps. conclusions: the eps provides a promising alternative with many added benefits compared to standard eeg sensors, including reduced setup time and elimination of sensor cross-coupling. in the future the scalability of the eps will allow the implementation of a whole head ultra-dense eps array.

microcontroller	background: neuroscience research on non-human primates usually requires the animals to sit in a chair. to do this, typically monkeys are fitted with collars and trained to enter the chairs using either a pole, leash and jump cage. animals may initially show resistance and risk injury. we have developed an automated chair-training method that minimizes restraints to ease the animals into their chairs. new method: we developed a method to automatically train animals to enter a primate chair and stick out their heads for neckplate placement. to do this, we fitted the chairs with arduino microcontrollers coupled to a water-reward system and touch-and proximity sensors. results and comparison with existing methods: we found that the animals responded well to the chair, partially entering the chair within hours, sitting inside the chair within days and allowing us to manually introduce a door and neck plate, all within 14-21 sessions. although each session could last many hours, automation meant that actual training person-hours could be as little as half an hour per day. the biggest advantage was that animals showed little resistance to entering the chair, compared to monkeys trained by leash pulling. conclusions: this automated chair-training method can take longer than the standard collar-and-leash approach, but multiple macaques can be trained in parallel with fewer person-hours. it is also a promising method for animal-use refinement and in our case, it was the only effective training approach for an animal suffering from a behavioral pathology.

electricity	conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to electricity using fuel cell technologies is a promising but challenging research topic for sustainable electricity production. this is because that lignocellulosic biomass generally cannot be directly used as a fuel for electricity generation in a conventional fuel cell with high efficiency. typical fuel cells that can convert lignocellulosic biomass to electricity under mild conditions (< 100 degrees c) include microbial fuel cells (mfc) and novel direct biomass fuel cells (dbfc) such as that mediated by polyoxo-metalates (poms) developed recently. however, the efficiency and power output for these low-temperature fuel cells still need to be improved for practical applications. in this review, we focus on the research advances of electricity generation in fuel cells that can be operated at low temperatures. more specifically, we discussed the progress, challenge and perspectives of biomass-fueled mfcs. recent interesting researches on dbfc were also highlighted in terms of the efficiency, principles, and technological obstacles. as concluded in this work, lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock for fuel cells because it is renewable, carbon neutral, and sustainable. however, the power density of lignocelluose-fueled mfc are usually far below that required for commercial applications. improving fermentable sugar release from lignocellulosic biomass and increasing the cell output power are the main research points. dbfc can obtain a high theoretical exergy recovery; however, it is still in its early stage of development with low efficiency. more research should be focused on the electrode development, cell design, parameter optimization, process integration, as well as understanding fundamental process mechanisms.

analog_signal_processing	recovery of waste heat from the electrical generator into the water preheating circuit of the steam thermal power plants (stpp) is a method frequently used to increase electricity production without additional consumption of primary energy. however, the manufacturers of turbine-generator sets do not explicitly indicate the effect of the method on their performances. using numerical modeling of steam cycle, the paper presents the method 's effects on the stpp performances. it also shows a method, simple, fast, and enough accurate, for estimating these effects, that could be applied when it is not possible to recalculate the whole cycle.
digital_control	this study presents a k-band differential voltage-controlled oscillator (vco) with robust start-up. a hybrid technique that combines open-loop digitally controlled tail current with switchable auxiliary cross-coupled pairs (accps) is proposed to ensure robust start-up for wideband operation. compared with prior closed-loop current controlling method, the proposed technique does not suffer from phase-noise degradation. furthermore, by evenly distributing the accps, transistors with smaller size are allowed to achieve the same start-up condition, which leads to frequency boost and phase-noise improvement. implemented in 0.18 m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, the vco achieves a wide-frequency tuning range of 21.4-26.29 ghz (20.5%) and a low phase noise of -108.8 dbc/hz at 1 mhz offset from 25.8 ghz carrier frequency. at 1.1 v power supply, the power consumption of the core circuit is 7.9-11.4 mw across the entire output frequency range.
electric_motor	the risk of epidemics and emerging or re-emerging diseases such as avian flit, tuberculosis, malaria and other vector-borne diseases, is rising. these risks can be contained with prevention, early warning, and prompt management. despite progress in information technology, communication is still a bottleneck for health early warning and response systems in post-disaster situations. this paper presents satellites for epidemiology (safe), a component-based interoperable architecture for health early warning that employs satellite, radio, and wireless networks, geographic information systems, integration technology, and data mining to promptly identify, and respond to a disease outbreak. in a post-disaster situation, a mobile health emergency coordination center is established and integrated to public health services for health monitoring. the added-value of safe for post-disaster health management will he demonstrated as part of an earthquake readiness exercise regarding a typhoid fever epidemic, in the island of crete. advanced communication and data mining techniques in safe offer new tools to the ""epidemic intelligence"" and contribute to advanced preparedness and prompt response by lifting communication barriers, promoting collaboration, and reducing the isolation of affected areas.
operational_amplifier	this paper presents a chopper instrumentation amplifier designed in 28nm cmos technology. the operational amplifier has a rail-to-rail folded cascode input stage, which ensures a constant gm over the available common-mode range. it is characterized by a nested miller compensation. all transistors operate in sub-threshold region; thus the opamp has been designed through a specific procedure for sub-threshold operation. the chopper technique is exploited to reduce the input referred offset and noise. the circuit operates with 0.9v supply voltage and exhibits a simulated 106db dc gain and 329khz gbw. montecarlo simulations demonstrate an offset distribution with 2.2 mu v standard deviation. the input noise spectral density is equal to 27nv/hz, giving a noise efficiency factor of 8.
electricity	risk analysis is essential for attracting investment to solar projects. this paper measures risk as the variability in internal rate of return (irr) and estimates it from the uncertainty in (i) future systems prices, (ii) operations costs and (iii) revenues based on energy yield, irradiance and electricity prices. we quantify these risks for photovoltaic (pv) and concentrated photovoltaic (cpv) projects starting in 2016, 18 and 20 for customers selling solar-generated electricity under a fixed feed-in tariff (fit) and for large business customers displacing electricity loads that they would pay for according to variable market rates. an international comparison of results is provided. uncertainty in future systems prices causes on average 45% (pv) and 93% (cpv) variation in irr, which is important to a developer 's planning process but is resolvable with negotiated system prices from suppliers. uncertainty in future operations costs impacts the irr by on average 17% (pv) and 20% (cpv). uncertainty in revenues impacts the irr by at most 3.6%. furthermore, the analysis shows that overall percentage variability in a project 's irr is much less than the percentage variability in operations costs and revenues, which are the two factors at play once the system is operating.

electric_motor	internal combustion engines inherently demand startup assistance to perform its autonomous functioning. nevertheless, the common solution over more than one century has been the electric starter motor, for both otto and diesel cycles. the dynamic coupling system defined herein as the mechanical connection between the internal combustion engine and the starter motor has not evolved considerably since the intermittent pinion-ring gear interface has been adopted. this paper reviews the conceptual design behind the starting systems developed so far, focusing on their functional analysis, and proposes an innovative concept. preliminary study on dynamic simulation using lumped parameters model, implemented in amesim, is also discussed as potential aid for the proposed design. based on decision matrix method, it is possible to evaluate the proposed design against state-of-the-art and promising alternatives to find a real cost-effective alternative to the existing concepts to couple the electric motor and the internal combustion engine. the patented dynamic coupling system proposed herein demonstrates potential to evolve as a cost-effective solution to implement start-stop systems worldwide, contributing to reduction of pollution caused by automotive vehicle emissions.

pid_controller	fiber laser can be used for fiber optic communications, laser cutting, industrial manufacture, defense security and many other fields because of its advantages of narrow output linewidth, good reproducibility, etc. however, due to nonlinear and thermal effects, only a limited output power of a single fiber can be obtained with a sharp attenuation of the output beam quality, which obstructs the applications of fiber lasers. therefore, the research of expanding the power of a fiber laser source while maintaining its beam quality by combining coherent beam has become a hot subject at present. in this field, the performance of phase control of coherent laser beams is a key factor to influence the efficiency of combination. the phase-controlling methods mainly include stochastic parallel gradient descent control algorithm, dithering, and heterodyne detection. in this paper, based on the active phase lock technology, the traditional heterodyne detection method is improved by the use of a fiber electro-optic phase modulator (eom) rather than an acousto-optic frequency shifter (aofs) to avoid the complex designs of the rf driver and circuit, which makes the overall experimental setup simple and stable. moreover, in order to achieve a stable and wide correction range of phase locking, two servo paths are designed by use of piezoelectric transducer (pzt) and eom1 to correct the optical phase differences. firstly, a single-frequency narrow-width fiber laser with its central wavelength of 1531 nm is split by a beam splitter to generate a signal and a reference beam, respectively. the reference beam is phase modulated by another eom2 with a 15 mhz signal. the phase error signal is obtained by demodulating the detected heterodyne signal at the modulation frequency. after that the error signal is divided into two parts, and sent to two pid servos to control pzt and eom1, respectively. the pzt, used in the slow feedback loop, eliminates the laser phase error induced by the ambient temperature drift, while the eom1, in the quick feedback loop, can eliminate the influence of high frequency noise. two pid servos are carefully designed according to the measurements of the dynamic response of the pzt and eom1. a stable feedback loop with a bandwidth of 220 khz (limited by the bandwidth of pid controller) is obtained according to the measurement of its phase error signal spectrum, thus a tight lock is expected. as a consequence, the error of phase locking is less than 0.88 degrees, which indicates that the phase control accuracy is lambda/400. the long-term stability of the system is assessed by a 2 hour monitoring of the lock error signal. according to the analysis of allan deviation, the best phase lock value of 0.006 degrees can be obtained for an integration time of 160 s. the overall phase lock experimental setup is simple and easy to operate; moreover the phase lock can be further improved by optimizing the parameters of the pid controller.

microcontroller	this paper further develops the concept of very large size flash-memory-based pulsewidth-modulated (pwm) algorithms for three-phase inverters. such algorithms differ from the conventional counter-based implementation, and they follow a preprogrammed optimal pwm pattern that is read from a very large size memory with magnitude and phase as coordinates. any sequence of states is thus possible within a pwm sampling interval. a novel digital structure has been built around the newly released flash memory integrated circuits. the paper demonstrates the feasibility of operation at any pwm sampling frequency up to 20 khz when using gigabit-size flash memory integrated circuits along any low-cost microcontroller with an spi peripheral. to empower the concept, a multioptimal pwm has been proposed and implemented on a 2-gbit memory table. the harmonics of the phase currents are reduced by more than 40% while a constant pwm sampling frequency is maintained in order to comply with the conventional vector control methods for grid or motor applications.

analog_signal_processing	we present a viewpoint showing that analog signal processing approaches are becoming configurable and programmable like their digital counterparts, while retaining a huge computational efficiency, for a given power budget, compared to their digital counterparts. we present recent results in programmable and configurable analog signal processing describing the widespread potential of these approaches. we discuss issues with configurable systems, including size, power, and computational tradeoffs, as well as address the computational efficiency of these approaches. analog circuits and systems research and education can significantly benefit from the computational flexibility provided by large-scale fpaas. the component density of these devices is sufficient to synthesize large systems in a short period of time. however, this level of reconfigurable and programmable complexity requires a development platform and cad tools to demonstrate the capabilities of large-scale fpaas before they will be widely accepted. to address this need, a self-contained fpaa setup has been developed along with an integrated software design flow. with only an ethernet connection and an ac power outlet, a researcher or student can explore the numerous analog circuit possibilities provided by large-scale fpaas.

microcontroller	transcranial magnetic stimulation devices has been used mainly for diagnostic purposes by measuring the functions of the nervous system rather than for treatment purposes, and has a problem of considerable energy fluctuations per repeated pulse. the majority of strokes are caused by ischemia and result in brain tissue damage, leading to problems of the central nervous system including hemiparesis, dysfunction of language and consciousness, and dysfunction of perception. control is difficult and the size is large due to the difficulty of digitalizing the energy stored in a capacitor, and there are many heavy devices. in addition, there are many constraints when it is used for a range of purposes such as head and neck diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of nerve palsy, muscle strengthening, treatment of urinary incontinence etc. output stabilization and minimization of the energy variation rate are required as the level of the transcranial magnetic stimulation device is dramatically improved and the demand for therapeutic purposes increases. this study developed a compact, low cost transcranial magnetic stimulation device with minimal energy variation of a high repeated pulse and output stabilization using a real time capacitor charge discharge voltage. ischemia was induced in male sd rats by closing off the common carotid artery for 5 minutes, after which the blood was re-perfused. in the cerebrum, the number of parp reactive cells after 24 hours significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the tms group compared to the gi group. as a result, tms showed the greatest effect on necrosis-related parp immuno-reactive cells 24 hours after ischemia, indicating necrosis inhibition, blocking of neural cell death, and protection of neural cells.
pid_controller	previous studies have shown that mimicking a human hand can be very challenging due to the fact that the structure of the human hand was delicate and complex. for a robotic hand, a simple task such as holding a pen requires a greater understanding of various topics such as hand mechanics and design, forward and inverse kinematics, tactile and force sensors, actuators and control. in this paper a new design of a multifingered robot hand known as a red hand is proposed. the model of the red is developed by using solidworks and simechanics. the red hand consists of 5 fingers, 16 degrees of freedom and actuated by the brushless dc motor. a pid controller is employed to show the effectiveness of the red hand grasping control. the simulation result showed that the pid controller was satisfactorily controlled each joint of the red hand. in addition, the red hand is able to grasp less than 2 seconds without overshoot and producing very small steady state error.

signal-flow_graph	multi-loop feedback control has attracted considerable attention due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. 1 in order to simplify the cumbersome analysis of a multiloop circuit, the signal flow graph representation should be used rather than our familiar nodal analysis methods. this paper presents a criterion from the well-established mason 's formula for multi-loop oscillator in terms of signal flow graphs. the multi-loop oscillator circuit based on two operational transresistance amplifiers (otras) is used as an example.
digital_control	event-triggered control aims at reducing the resource utilization, especially the communication over the feedback link, while guaranteeing a certain control performance. although setpoint tracking problems are common in practice, the majority of the proposed approaches in literature focus on regulation problems. therefore, an event-triggered pi control design strategy with guaranteed performance is proposed in this paper, where both the event-triggering condition and the pi controller are implemented periodically. based on a quadratic cost function, the pi control design problem is introduced and formulated as an lmi optimization problem. comparisons with other approaches in the literature are made by simulation and by experimental studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

analog_signal_processing	this paper presents the optimal design of an electromagnetic vibration-based generator using the simulated annealing method (sa). to optimally extract the vibrational energy of a system vibrating at a specific frequency, the selected mass and spring stiffness of a resonant vibration is required. the relationship between induced energy and the generator 's structure, its permanent magnet height and diameter, number of turns, and wire diameter in a single air coil are discussed. also, a prototype of the vibration-based electrical generator is built and tested via a shaker excited at resonance frequency and input amplitude of 0.06mm. consequently, results reveal that the design parameters (permanent magnet height and diameter, number of turns, and wire diameter) play essential roles in maximizing electrical power.
analog_signal_processing	wave energy is currently an untapped resource, but has the potential to make a significant contribution to the energy mix. in order to use conventional electrical generators mechanical interfaces are used, such as hydraulic systems and air-turbines. with the electrical generator these interfaces are known as the electrical power take-off and the type used depends upon the wave energy device. a brief description of the different power take offs is provided to show how conventional rotary generators are used in wave devices. both advantages and disadvantages are highlighted in the paper. direct drive systems can overcome some of the disadvantages, but there are additional engineering challenges to overcome, in particular physical size and mass. current and more novel direct machine topologies are discussed in the context of these challenges.
electrical_circuits	electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry techniques were employed to study borohydride oxidation on a polycrystalline pt electrode in an aqueous alkaline media containing 0.05 m nabh4 and 1 m naoh. determined current density changes were interpreted in combination with eis measurements. the regions of decreasing anodic current leading to negative polarization resistance, r-p, were supposed to be appreciably related to increasing availability of oxygen-containing species (ohad and pt oxides) on the pt surface in the presence of the accumulated borohydride species. possible borohydride oxidation processes and electrical circuits were discussed regarding the potential applied.
microcontroller	this paper presents a handheld robust battery-operated contact-based ovality meter suitable for the measurement of ovality in pipeline in a plant site or in any industrial establishment. the ovality meter is mainly composed of a specially designed inductor with ferrite core. this inductor constitutes the part of an lc-type logic gate oscillator (lgo). a change in the sensor position during the measurement of pipe diameter causes a small change in inductance, which in turn changes the pulse frequency of the lgo when it is powered by 5 v dc. thus, frequency, the output of the instrument that is displayed on the liquid crystal display of the embedded processor, is a function of displacement. by measuring the diameter of pipe specimen at different locations, the ovality is computed. in the present design, the range of position measurement is about 25 mm. the sensitivity in position measurement up to 10 mm is similar to 850 hz/mm, which further reduces in higher range (>10 to 25 mm). such a sensitivity in the position measurement seems to be quite suitable for ovality measurement.

signal-flow_graph	the structure of dynamic neural networks and their on-line learning algorithm are two important factors for naicss (nonlinear adaptive inverse control system). recurrent neural networks are effective identifiers for nonlinear plant. however, they have complex architecture. in order to simplify the structure of dynamic neural networks, this paper proposed an improved dafnn (dynamic activation function neural network) by changing the neurons' structure. the modified dfann with the same simple feedforward architecture as the origin one had better dynamic ability. gradient. vectors calculation becomes the chief bottleneck for learning algorithms of dafnns due to its complex chain rule expansions. a new on-line learning algorithm was proposed to simplify the proceeding of gradient calculation for dafnns in this paper according to signal flow graph theory. the new algorithm had adaptive learning rates to guarantee its convergence. the algorithm was used as the learning algorithms of identifier and controller in naicss. simulation results show it is an efficient algorithm for naicss.
electricity	smart meters play vital roles in the aspects of the management and operation of smart grids such as demand response, energy efficiency improvement, and electricity pricing. massive amounts of data are being collected owing to the popularity of smart meters. two main issues should be addressed in this context. one is the communication and storage of big data from smart meters at reduced cost. the other is the effective extraction of useful information from this massive dataset. in this paper, the k-svd sparse representation technique, which includes two phases (dictionary learning and sparse coding), is used to decompose load profiles into linear combinations of several partial usage patterns (pups), which allows the smart meter data to be compressed and hidden electricity consumption patterns to be extracted. then, a linear support vector machine (svm) based method is used to classify the load profiles into two groups, residential customers and small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), based on the extracted patterns. comprehensive comparisons with the results of k-means clustering, the discrete wavelet transform (dwt), principal component analysis (pca), and piecewise aggregate approximation (paa) are conducted on real datasets in ireland. the results show that our proposed technique outperforms these methods in both compression ratio and classification accuracy.

pid_controller	the objective of the proposed work is to investigate the performance of hybrid self tuned fuzzy proportional integral derivative (stfpid) controller for brushless dc (bldc) motor drive. the proposed hybrid stfpid controller includes a proportional integral derivative (pid) controller at steady state, a pid type self tuned fuzzy logic (fl) controller (stflc) at transient state thereby combining the merits of both the controllers. the switching function incorporated in the controller ensures desired control response at various operating conditions by appropriately switching between pid and stfpid based on speed error. a detailed simulation study and performance comparison with other control approaches is performed to highlight the merits of the proposed work. the simulation results indicate that the proposed controller is robust with fast tracking capability and less steady state error. the experimental results are provided to validate the simulation study.
state_space_representation	a new system model based on state space representation of the received signal for narrow-band interference suppression in direct sequence-spread spectrum (ds-ss) system is given. this model recursively estimates the interfering signal in the presence of desired information and white gaussian noise. to further improve the performance, we employ mmse criteria to estimate the transmitted symbols. the mmse estimate requires low computational complexity than code-aided techniques. our simulation results demonstrate that this technique provides better sinr improvement over to nonlinear predictor, linear predictor, kalman-bucy predictor for -65 db to -5 db input sinr and up to 10 db awgn power. for high interfering signal and noise power, our results clearly show that our sinr improvement performance exceeds the sinr improvement upper-bound calculated for the prediction based techniques. besides reducing the effect of interfering signal, our technique also reduces awgn noise. our model also provides better ber performance than nonlinear predictor.
analog_signal_processing	modern electronic systems claim for analog-to-digital (a/d) interfaces with strong requirements in terms of resolution and frequency. among several a/d architectures that intent to achieve these hard specifications, time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters (tiadc) arises as a competitive candidate. tiadc offer a higher sampling frequency with suitable moderate power consumption. however, their architecture introduces mismatch errors that affect the resolution of data conversion. calibration methods permit to reduce significantly the impact of these errors. a possible solution is the insertion of an additional circuitry in the a/d conversion system: a built-in self-calibration (bisc). a bisc system aims to compensate imperfections from the tiadc, such as offset, gain and timing errors. despite the benefits carried by the bisc, this system also introduces errors in the overall data conversion system. this paper proposes a case study of a mixed-signal bisc tiadc, highlighting the strengths and the weakness of using built-in calibration circuits. supplementary calibration methods will be explored to mitigate the impact of the bisc and to improve the a/d conversion performance. the debate is open: how calibration systems must be calibrated ?
electric_motor	electric propulsion has emerged as one of the most efficient propulsion arrangements for several vessel types over the last decades. even though examples can be found in the history at the end of 19th century, and further into the 20th century, the modern use of electric propulsion started in the 1980s along with the development of semiconductor switching devices to be used in high power drives (dc drives and later ac-to-ac drives). this development opened up for full rpm control of propellers and thrusters, and thereby enabling a simplification of the mechanical structure. however, the main reason for using electric propulsion in commercial ship applications is the potential for fuel savings compared to equivalent mechanical alternatives, except for icebreakers where the performance of an electric powered propeller is superior to a combustion engine powered propeller. the fuel saving potential lies within the fact that the applicable vessels have a highly varying operation profile and are seldom run at full power. this favors the power plant principle in which electric power can be produced at any time with optimum running of prime movers, e.g., diesel engines, by turning on and off units depending on the power demand for propulsion and other vessel loads. icebreakers were among the first vessels to take advantage of this technology later followed by cruise vessel, and the offshore drilling vessels operating with dynamic positioning (dp). the converter technology was rapidly developing and soon the dc drives were replaced with ac drives. in the same period electric propulsion emerged as basic standard for large cruise liners, and dp operated drilling vessels, but also found its way into other segments as shuttle tankers, ferries, and other special vessels. at the same time podded propulsion were introduced, where the electric motor was mounted directly on the propeller shaft in a submerged 360 degrees steerable pod, adding better efficiency, improved maneuvering, and reduced installation space/cost to the benefits of electric propulsion. the future trends are now focusing on further optimization of efficiency by allowing multiple energy sources, independent operation of individual power producers, and energy storage for various applications, such as power back up, peak shaving, or emission free operation (short voyages).
system_identification	we present an iterative algorithm, called the symmetric tensor eigen-rank-one iterative decomposition (steroid), for decomposing a symmetric tensor into a real linear combination of symmetric rank-1 unit-norm outer factors using only eigendecompositions and least-squares fitting. originally designed for a symmetric tensor with an order being a power of two, steroid is shown to be applicable to any order through an innovative tensor embedding technique. numerical examples demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme even for large scale problems. furthermore, we show how steroid readily solves a problem in nonlinear block-structured system identification and nonlinear state-space identification.

electrical_circuits	there is a lack of system-level finite element (fe) model which can directly predict the performance of a piezoelectric energy harvester connected with interface circuits and electric load. this work developed a system-level model of piezoelectric strain energy harvesting system by directly coupling the finite element and electrical circuits. the strain energy harvester (seh) is a macro fibber composite adhesively bonded to a composite beam. simulations were performed with the seh connected with three circuits individually (i) a load resistor, (ii) a rectifier terminated with a load resistor and (iii) a rectifier terminated with a smoothing capacitor and a load resistor. experimental tests were carried out to validate the simulation results. good agreements were observed between the simulated and measured results. the developed model is able to predict the performance of the energy harvesting system when different circuit was connected. the validated system-level model can be used for the design and optimization of piezoelectric energy harvesting system by investigating the interactions between energy harvester and electrical circuits.
electrical_network	in this paper, a new solution is proposed for the remote monitoring and control of distributed generators (dgs) and energy storage systems (esss) connected to low-voltage distribution networks. the proposed system fulfills the in-force standard requirements for the connection of dgs to the utility grid. moreover, it allows implementing some enhanced functions for the remote control of inverters of dgs and esss, not only in terms of disconnection but also in terms of voltage regulation and power shuttering. the proposed solution is based on a new interface protection system and a dedicated secondary substation concentrator, which allows the communication between the distributed system operator and the inverters of dgs or esss. the proposed system was tested on field in the electrical network of the island of ustica. an experimental characterization was carried out to find the best communication conditions, i.e., the frequency band with the lowest noise and attenuation, considering the signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio constraints, as well as the desired transmission data rate and transfer time.

state_space_representation	lap time simulation is one of the most powerful tools for evaluating design proposals in motorsport engineering. in particular, transient simulations play an important role as the ultimate and more accurate approach than other static or quasi-steady-state methodologies. in this paper, first, the method to transform the differential equations of a system into a formally linear continuous and then discrete state-space representation, particularised for a seven-degree-of-freedom suspension and a transient cornering model, is proposed. the use of time-variant coefficients in the matrices of the model will allow the non-linear and time-variant characteristics of these systems to be described. second, in the case of the transient cornering model, this representation is translated into a transfer function in order to apply a discrete control strategy such as a finite-time strategy or a predictive strategy for an adaptive ideal driver. it was found that the calculation methodology described above can be successfully applied with a more than acceptable degree of accuracy according to comparison with the results using other mechanical or numerical software (adams or simulink). it was also observed that the use of the curvature of the track as a reference in the control closed loop is sufficiently accurate to force the car to follow the target path closely. furthermore, both predictive control and finite-time control (including integration) provide excellent results with a smooth response of the steering input. many lap time simulators are language specific; however, the methodology proposed in this paper will run in most programming languages.
pid_controller	this paper proposes an approach of forming the average performance by grey modeling, and use an average performance as reference model for performing evolutionary computation with error type control performance index. the idea of the approach is to construct the reference model based on the performance of unknown systems when users apply evolutionary computation to fine-tune the control systems with error type performance index. we apply this approach to particle swarm optimization for searching the optimal gains of baseline pi controller of wind turbines operating at the certain set point in region 3. in the numerical simulation part, the corresponding results demonstrate the effectiveness of grey modeling.

pid_controller	today, the buildings' energy consumption is considerable amount of whole. therefore, optimizing energy in buildings leads to a noticeable decrease in total energy consumption of the world. energy-efficient buildings have developed by carrying out great research effort. the control procedures serve as a privileged method to help new buildings to comply with the most optimal system as an energy consumer and thus meet 'nearly zero-energy'. the purpose of this paper is to present a method of controlling the building temperature and simultaneously reducing the cost of providing the hybrid heating systems with sufficient energy. investigating a room in tehran city on a day as an example, methods of (a) model predictive control (mpc) with economic optimization (mpc consecutively with on-off), (b) mpc without economic optimization, (c) proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller optimized by genetic algorithm (ga) in presence of gas thermal source, (d) pid controller optimized with ga in presence of electric thermal source and (e) pid controller optimized with multi-objective ga in the presence of two gas and electric thermal sources have been designed and implemented in this research. furthermore, the effect of each of these methods on cost reduction and temperature regulation of inside of the room has been studied. eventually it has been specified that using mpc method with economical optimization has the highest influence on cost reduction and keeps the temperature of inside of the room in the predefined range. this method achieved cost saving of 50% compared to the mpc and ga. but the main targets of this study are both of regulating inside temperature and cost optimization. according to the main targets of this study, using mpc methods without economical optimization and multi-objective genetic algorithm would be more effective.

pid_controller	features like high power to weight ratio, self lubrication, heat dissipation and fast control make hydraulic systems superior to mechanical and electric systems. such systems are used in aircraft, motion simulators, metal-cutting, universal-testing machines and material handling for heavy industries. for a precision operation, it is usual to employ electrohydraulic servo systems that are more sophisticated than systems with proportional valve. due to larger deadband and higher flow nonlinearities, the low-cost rugged proportional valves together with standard pid controllers result in poor response for tracking demand. a controller has been designed through a novel state estimation algorithm and the usual pole placement (pp) technique by carefully choosing the operating points. one high friction cylinder and another industrial grade cylinder have been driven separately by using the same proportional control valve. the designed controller has yielded better performance compare to the pid controller.

pid_controller	this paper presents a novel control scheme based on auto-tuning pid controller to suppress wing rock phenomena. due to having a complex dynamic, wing rock motion identification is not a simple task, and this complexity can adversely affect the performance of pid controller. employing a wavelet neural network based identifier, this paper develops an auto tuning adaptive pid controller to tackle the problem. since having an acceptable control performance inevitably involves having a meticulously trained identifier, the training performance is of utmost importance. aiming at boosting the training efficacy, a two-phase algorithm encompassing bees algorithm and back-propagation (bp) is proposed by this paper to train the proposed identifier respectively in off-line and on-line modes. due to its inherent capability in sifting the global minima, bees algorithm is employed to find initial values of weights around which it is then possible to conduct a local search by means of bp based online training. therefore, the identifier can precisely furnish the proposed pid controller with the system sensitivity in on-line mode. the adaption of pid controller can thus be performed in each time step. the performance of this method has been presented in simulation results and the comparison section confirms the effectiveness of proposed scheme.

electric_motor	induction motors fail due to many reasons, and many are rewound two or more times during their lifetimes. it is generally assumed that a rewound motor is not as efficient as the original motor. precise estimation of efficiency of a refurbished motor or any existing motor is crucial in industries for energy savings, auditing, and management. full-load and partial-load efficiency can be measured by using the dynamometer. this paper presents a novel technique for estimating refurbished induction motors' full-load and partial-load efficiencies from only no-load tests. the technique can be applied in any electric motor workshop and eliminates the need for the dynamometer procedure. it also eliminates the need for the locked-rotor test. experimental and field results of testing eight induction motors are presented, and the degree of accuracy is shown by comparing the estimated efficiencies against the measured values. to provide the necessary credits to the proposed technique, an error analysis is conducted to investigate the level of uncertainty through testing three induction motors, and the results of uncertainty of the direct measurements and no-load measurements using the proposed technique are presented.
microcontroller	plant irradiation during the germination period, by using environmental low level microwave radiation (known as electrosmog) alters the plant germination and the growing process. in order to analyze if such a subtle effect is generated only by the microwave irradiation, the environmental parameters (light, temperature, and humidity) must be kept identical for the reference and the irradiated lot. this is a difficult task because the humidity and temperature are interrelated. in order to study the plant behavior under microwaves low power irradiation, the paper describes the design, manufacturing and operating process and device performances on plant growth. to this end, a low power microwave field (average microwaves power density of 3.8 mw/m(2)) under controlled environmental parameters is used. the device consists of a reference chamber (r) and a microwave irradiation chamber (i), of 0.5 m(3) volume each one, equipped with access doors. the irradiation chamber ensures microwave field distribution with programmable power, frequency and bandwidth in the most commonly used standards for network communication such as: global system for mobile communications (gsm900/1800), code division multiple access (cdma), the third generation of mobile telecommunications technology (3g) or 2.4/5 ghz wireless local area network (wlan). both chambers provide a radiofrequency (rf) shielding (at least -60 db) against and toward outside, so the electrosmog is shielded and does not interfere with the inner environment. both chambers are equipped with performing temperature/humidity sensors and controlled led lighting system (maximum 400 mu mol cm(-2) s(-1)) with a uniformity of +/- 5 mu mol cm(-2) s(-1) measured at the bottom level of the chamber. an embedded system (microcontroller) measures the temperature and humidity and proceeds continuously to match the humidity into the chambers pair with less than +/- 1.5% relative humidity (rh) difference, by using a low flux exhaust ventilation process through a simple innovative method. the accuracy of the temperature measurement is better than +/- 0.2 degrees c. humidity and temperature data set are logged (with programmable acquisition rate) during the whole experiment and can be read later by a personal computer. to identify the influence of microwave treatment on bean seeds and plants development, three growing experiments were settled, based on 122 bean seeds each. the number of germinated seeds (determined each day during 8 days of experiment), the germination energy (ge [%]) of the seeds, the length of stems (sl) and roots (rl), the germination (g) [%], the seedling vigor index (svi) and dry matter content (dm%) have been measured and computed. the obtained data showed significant increase for all parameters on microwave irradiation condition.

pid_controller	proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controllers are the most popular control systems equipped in industries due to their simplicity, effectiveness, and functionality. in this article, an adaptive differential evolution (de) algorithm is presented to tune controller parameters of pid systems. the proposed algorithm uses shift based parameter control and pseudo population reduction procedures. all algorithmic parameters of de are adapted and no additional parameter is introduced. a set of three typical control instances is taken to study the performance of the proposed algorithm. four recently reported de algorithms are chosen as baselines. through numerical experiment, it turns out that the proposed algorithm yields better performance than the four baseline de algorithms. moreover, the proposed algorithm has a better scalability and reliability than other test algorithms.
control_engineering	the transition time between states plays an important role in designing quantum devices as they are very sensitive to environmental influences. decoherence phenomenon is responsible for possible destructions of the entanglement that is a fundamental requirement to implement quantum information processing systems. if the time between states is minimized, the decoherence effects can be reduced, thus, it is advantageous to the designer to develop expressions for time performance measures. quantum speed limit (qsl) problem has been studied from the theoretical point of view, providing general results. considering the implementation of quantum control systems, as the decoherence phenomenon is unavoidable, it is important to apply these general results to particular cases, developing expressions and performance measures, to assist control engineering designers. here, a minimum time performance measure is defined for quantum control problems, for time-independent or time-dependent hamiltonians, and applied to some practical examples, providing hints that may be useful for researchers pursuing optimization strategies for quantum control systems.
voltage_law	today 's power systems become more prone to cyber-attacks due to the high integration of information technologies. in this paper, we demonstrate that the outages of some lines can be masked by injecting false data into a set of measurements. the success of the topology attack can be guaranteed by making that: 1) the injected false data obeys kirchhoff current law and kirchhoff voltage law to avoid being detected by the bad data detection program in the state estimation and 2) the residual in the line outage detection is increased such that the line outage cannot be detected by phasor measurement unit data. a bilevel optimization problem is set up to determine the optimal attack vector that can maximize the residual of the outaged line. the ieee 39-bus and 118-bus systems are used to demonstrate the masking scheme.
electric_motor	to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in hybrid electric vehicles (hevs), it is important to develop a well-organized energy management system (ems). this paper proposes a torque control strategy coupled with optimization for a parallel hev. a torque control strategy is developed first. in particular, a function to control the driving condition, called the internal combustion engine (ice) torque control function, is introduced. this function controls the driving conditions (electric motor (em) driving, ice driving, and ice driving assisted by em) for reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. this function depends on several design variables that should be optimized. numerical simulation of hev using matlab/simulink is so computationally intensive that a sequential approximate optimization (sao) using a radial basis function network (rbf) is adopted to determine the optimal values of these design variables. as the result, the optimal ice torque control function is determined with a small number of simulation runs. in this paper, co2 and nox emissions are minimized simultaneously for reducing the fuel consumption and exhaust emission. through numerical simulations using typical driving cycles, the trade-off between co2 and nox emissions is clarified and the validity of the proposed torque control strategy coupled with the proposed optimization is examined.
electrical_network	power quality (pq) disturbances are becoming increasingly important concerns of the network operators and customers during the delivery of power. voltage dip is one of the pq disturbances which is caused by different factors but mainly by the unpredictable faults occurring at different parts of the electrical network. dips originating at some parts of the network may propagate to other parts of the network causing huge financial losses to industrial and commercial customers. knowing the maximal fault impedance beyond which dips are not detected by the monitoring equipment is very helpful for the grid operator. this paper mainly focuses on the influence of critical impedance or distance, which is measured from a point of common coupling (pcc) at the main busbar next to the ilv/mv transformer to the fault point, to the monitoring of dips. a typical dutch mv network is analyzed and mathematical models are developed with different fault types. taking the different grounding techniques into account, simulations are performed using matlab. for industrial customers connected to the same pcc, the critical distances corresponding to each fault types are evaluated and compared. based on computer simulations, the dips missed by the monitoring device placed at the most appropriate location are thoroughly discussed. the influence of different system groundings on the phase and line voltage dips are also explained in this paper. moreover, the transfer of dips from mv to lv network and the impact of the critical distance with each fault to the transfer of dips are briefly explained.
electrical_circuits	electrode performances of iro2-ta2o5/ti and pbo2/ti anodes were investigated by electrochemical measurements and phenol oxidation. the cyclic voltammetry (cv), polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis) conducted in phenol solution indicate the oxidation ability of pbo2/ti anode is higher than that of iro2-ta2o5/ti electrode because it can reduce oxygen evolution and thus increase effective current. a novel parameter, gamma, associated with anode materials was proposed to quantitatively describe the effective current applied to main reactions and its value could be achieved through eis fitted data of the components in equivalent electrical circuits (eec). the suitability of the used eec was checked by consistency of the exchange current density between tafel plots and eis data. with involvement of the novel parameter (gamma) into organics oxidation, a universal kinetics was thereafter presented to predict variations of chemical oxygen demand, average current efficiency and power consumption. the results of regression analysis and f-test show higher agreement between the experimental and model estimation during phenol oxidation, verifying necessity of the parameter gamma in characterizing effective current for anodic reactions and rationality of the kinetics in describing organics oxidation by different electrodes.

system_identification	the acquisition of information from parallel sensory pathways is a hallmark of coordinated movement in animals. insect flight, for example, relies on both mechanosensory and visual pathways. our challenge is to disentangle the relative contribution of each modality to the control of behavior. toward this end, we show an experimental and analytical framework leveraging sensory conflict, a means for independently exciting and modeling separate sensory pathways within a multisensory behavior. as a model, we examine the hovering flower-feeding behavior in the hawkmoth manduca sexta. in the laboratory, moths feed from a robotically actuated two-part artificial flower that allows independent presentation of visual and mechanosensory cues. freely flying moths track lateral flower motion stimuli in an assay spanning both coupled motion, in which visual and mechanosensory cues follow the same motion trajectory, and sensory conflict, in which the two sensory modalities encode different motion stimuli. applying a frequency-domain system identification analysis, we find that the tracking behavior is, in fact, multisensory and arises from a linear summation of visual and mechanosensory pathways. the response dynamics are highly preserved across individuals, providing a model for predicting the response to novel multimodal stimuli. surprisingly, we find that each pathway in and of itself is sufficient for driving tracking behavior. when multiple sensory pathways elicit strong behavioral responses, this parallel architecture furnishes robustness via redundancy.
electric_motor	multi-rotors vehicles have become a consolidated reality in modern aeronautical field. these small helicopters consist in a fuselage ""hanged"" under a set of fixed pitch propellers each powered by an electric motor. these vehicles have great potentials and research in this topic is increasing aimed to reduce the structure weight to maximize flight time, range and payload. multi rotor components represent a key challenge for 3d modeling, optimization and additive manufacturing: they mainly consist in complex shapes where the most important feature are robustness and lightweight. usually produced in small series, for example, eight parts for a single prototype, they almost need to be able to interface different materials. the work here presented shows the advanced research conducted in cooperation between altair engineering and politecnico di torino to develop vital components for the structure of a multi-rotor: they represent a challenge because the main need is to interface arms, consisting in carbon fiber tubes, with motor or frame, both made in 7075 alloy. the use of topology optimization techniques plays a key role to minimize the weight of the components and to improve the productivity of the machines. moreover, additive manufacturing (fdm with sharebot ng) allows producing more parts in less time improving the cost effectiveness of the project. the process will be described from a simple characterization of the anisotropic properties of 3-d printed specimens to fem analysis of the preliminary design of the component and to the optimization phase performed with altair optistruct code. an important role is played from the altair tool used for the preliminary design: inspire. this tool is conceived to generate structural efficient concepts quickly and easily to obtain lighter designs and eliminate structural design problems and finally provide input files for 3-d printers.

electric_motor	crocodilians are by their very nature difficult animals to study. however, research on wild animals is essential for the development of reliable long-term management. here, we describe methods for the acquisition and monitoring of behavioural and physiological variables from free-ranging crocodilians through the use of archival tags (data-loggers) and via satellite, radio and acoustic telemetry. specifically, the attachment or implantation of electronic tags is described and examples provided of the type of data that can be collected. our research group has used a combination of approaches to monitor the movements, diving activity, body temperatures and heart rates of crocodilians, including studies on the australian freshwater crocodile (crocodylus johnstoni), the estuarine crocodile (crocodylus porosus) and the caiman (caiman latirostris). each approach or method presents unique challenges and problems, chiefly as a consequence of differences in body morphology and size of the crocodilian species, their behaviours and the habitats they occupy.
analog_signal_processing	the well known built-in voltage potential for some select semiconductor p-n junctions and various rectifying devices is proposed to be favorable for generating dc electricity at ""zero bias"" (with no dc bias voltage applied) in the presence of johnson noise or 1/f noise which originates from the quantum vacuum (koch et at., 1982). the 1982 koch discovery that certain solid state devices exhibit measurable quantum noise has also recently been labeled a finding of dark energy in the lab (beck and mackey, 2004). tunnel diodes are a class of rectifiers that are qualified and some have been credited with conducting only because of quantum fluctuations. microwave diodes are also good choices since many are designed for zero bias operation. a completely passive, unamplified zero bias diode converter/detector for millimeter (ghz) waves was developed by hrl labs in 2006 under a darpa contract, utilizing a sb-based ""backward tunnel diode"" (btd). it is reported to be a ""true zero-bias diode"". it was developed for a ""field radiometer"" to ""collect thermally radiated power"" (in other words, 'night vision'). the diode array mounting allows a feed from horn antenna, which functions as a passive concentrating amplifier. an important clue is the ""noise equivalent power"" of 1.1 pw per root hertz and the ""noise equivalent temperature difference"" of 10 degrees k, which indicate sensitivity to johnson noise (lynch, et al., 2006). there also have been other inventions such as ""single electron transistors"" that also have ""the highest signal to noise ratio"" near zero bias. furthermore, ""ultrasensitive"" devices that convert radio frequencies have been invented that operate at outer space temperatures (3 degrees above zero point: 3 degrees k). these devices are tiny nanotech devices which are suitable for assembly in parallel circuits (such as a 2-d array) to possibly produce zero point energy direct current electricity with significant power density (brenning el al., 2006). photovoltaic p-n junction cells are also considered for possible higher frequency zpe transduction. diode arrays of self-assembled molecular rectifiers or preferably, nano-sized cylindrical diodes are shown to reasonably provide for rectification of electron fluctuations from thermal and non-thermal zpe sources to create an alternative energy dc electrical generator in the picowatt per diode range.

analog_signal_processing	in hybrid electric vehicle (hev) drive-trains an electrical generator is coupled onto the shaft of an internal-combustion engine (ice) in order to process either the entire or a given fraction of the traction power required by the vehicle wheels. as such an ice-driven generator is being confined within the vehicle hood and is exposed to heating resulting from ice operation, high compactness, totally-enclosed construction and suitable machine cooling arrangement become challenging targets the generator design must deal with. due to unique characteristics such as higher torque per volume and higher efficiency compared to other machine topologies, the axial-field permanent magnet machine (afpm) topology was selected for the development of a 15 kw @ 4500 rev/min rated generator prototype that would be utilized in a demonstrator of hev drive train. this paper describes the original solutions adopted for the design of such a hev generator and reports experimental results taken from the prototype machine.
pid_controller	sharma et al. have investigated the performance of two-layered fractional order fuzzy logic controller (tl-foflc) for a 2-link rigid planer robotic manipulator with payload. in this work, the performance of tl-foflc has been compared with two-layered flc (tl-flc), single-layered flc (sl-flc) and the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controllers, for trajectory tracking, model uncertainties and disturbance rejection. in this comment, it is pointed out that this work has several missing essential parameters, and therefore, it is not possible for the reader to validate all the claimed results of sharma et al. (2016). six numerical values, three gains for each of the used two pid controllers are found to be unreported in addition to the six gains for each of the used two sl-flcs. since the performances of the pids and the sl-flcs are highly dependent on their tuned gains it is concluded that the reported performances of these controllers cannot be validated.

control_engineering	the reuse of some industrial by-products in the construction industry saves natural resources and energy, while at the same time reduces environmental problems related to their surface disposal. mine tailings are currently among the largest industrial by-products in the world, and yet, only limited studies have been conducted to evaluate their reuse potential. moreover, abandoned base-metal tailings are increasingly used in some developing countries for the manufacture of mortars without any control, engineering basis or environmental concern. in this study, an experimental program using mechanical tests, mineralogical investigations and leaching tests is presented to assess the use of low sulfide base-metal tailings, with varying properties, as fine aggregates for rendering and masonry mortars. an authentic case study illustrating their use in moroccan construction is additionally presented. overall, it was observed that the main properties affecting the performances of these tailings-based mortars are the residual pb-zn concentrations and the fine content of each tailing. the pb-zn fraction, when using the appropriate substitution level, may serve as an active set retardant improving mortars setting time. the leaching of metals was also successfully stabilized in mortars.

electric_motor	appropriate structure is the first key issue that a designer of an efficient hybrid vehicle should pay attention to. this paper presents three different structures for the concept of series-parallel structure in hybrid electric vehicles (hevs) and compares them with each other for the application of toyota prius 2004 as a well-known case study. the first structure consisting of one electric motor, one electric generator, and one power split device is the conventional structure as one existing in toyota prius 2004 and called ths-ii in the literature. the second and third structures are based on two special electric machines named transmotor-based structure (tbs) and dual-mechanical-port (dmp) machine-based structure (dmpbs), respectively. the three structures are compared by considering different aspects such as weight, occupied volume, and overall efficiency. a surface-mounted fractional-slot concentrated winding dmp machine is designed, and the design is verified by applying the finite-element analysis. simulation results have been presented to support the accomplished comparison of the structures under study. simulation results show that all structures have approximately equal weight, volume, and efficiency, but dmpbs is a compact, efficient, and simple way to convert the existing fossil-fuel cars into an hev. one dmp machine prototype has been implemented, and experimental results have been included.

microcontroller	moisture measurement in ppm level is always challenging and costly. among different technologies available for moisture measurement, the thin film capacitive sensor-based dew point meter offers a low-cost solution. still, the cost of the dew point meter is high and it suffers from high response time. there is a need of wireless moisture measurement in ppm level that is not available with the commercial meter according to our knowledge. this paper deals with development of a low-cost passive wireless tag for capacitive type sensors. the tag can be energized by any 13.56-mhz commercial tag reader from a distance of 1 cm (approx). the tag is capable of transmitting sensor data at 2.4-ghz ism band up to a distance of 12 m. an efficient algorithm has been developed to reduce the power consumption. the prototype system has been tested with two custom designed capacitive sensors to measure humidity over a wide range. both sensors, having a highly stable hygroscopic film of al2o3, are fabricated in the lab. finally, a low-cost (approximately u.s. $250) digital hygrometer to measure trace moisture has been developed. the performances of the digital hygrometer have been compared with the commercial dew point meter, and accuracy is found to be nearly 1% in the range of 6.5-127-ppm moisture. the system can be employed for contactless measurement with any capacitive sensor in the range of 50-3200 pf.
electrical_circuits	the advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (aster) is one of the five sensors on the nasa 's terra satellite on orbit since december 1999. aster consists of three radiometers, the visible and near infrared (vnir), the short-wave infrared (swir) and thermal infrared (tir) whose spatial resolutions are 15 m, 30 m and 90 m, respectively. unfortunately the swir image data are saturated since april 2008 due to the offset rise caused by the cooler temperature rise, but the vnir and the tir are taking earth images of good quality. the vnir and the tir experienced responsivity degradation while the swir showed little change. from the lamp calibration, band 1 decreased the most among three vnir bands and 31 % in thirteen years. the vnir has the electrical calibration mode to check the healthiness of the electrical circuits through the charge coupled device (ccd). four voltage levels from line 1 to line 4, which are from 2.78 v to 3.10 v, are input to the ccd in the onboard calibration sequence and the output digital numbers (dns) are detected in the images. these input voltages are monitored as telemetry data and have been stable up to now. from the electrical calibration we can check stabilities of the offset, gain ratio and gain stability of the electric circuit. the output level of the line1 input is close to the offset level which is measured while observing the earth at night. the trend of the line 1 output is compared to the offset level. they are similar but are not exactly the same. the trend of the even pixel and odd pixel is the same so the saturated offset levels of the odd pixel is corrected by using the even pixel trend. the gain ratio trend shows that the ratio is stable. but the ratio values are different from those measured before launch. the difference comes up to 10 % for the band 2. the correct gain ratio should be applied to the vicarious calibration result because the onboard calibration is measured with the normal gain whereas the vicarious calibration often measures with the high gain. the cause of the vnir responsivity degradation is not known but one of the causes might be the change of the electric circuit. the band 3 gain shows 16 % decrease whereas the gain changes of the band 1 and band 2 are 5 % to 8 %. the responsivity decrease after 1000 days since launch might be controlled by the electric circuit change.
operational_amplifier	the control systems course is taught in educational electric engineering programs all over the world. the method used for teaching this course is mainly by mathematical representation and software simulation of systems' behavior. in this work the author presents a different approach, which is based on making hands-on experimental applications. the solution presented in this article is based on decomposing and re-arranging the transfer function representation of a dynamic system in order to implement it using electronic circuits. combining the presented method with a popular simulation software leads to the implementation of practical and effective laboratory classes for this course.
electricity	as one of the most successfully commercialized distributed energy resources, the long-term effects of microturbines (mts) on the distribution network has not been fully investigated due to the complex thermo-fluid-mechanical energy conversion processes. this is further complicated by the fact that the parameter and internal data of mts are not always available to the electric utility, due to different ownerships and confidentiality concerns. to address this issue, a general modeling approach for mts is proposed in this paper, which allows for the long-term simulation of the distribution network with multiple mts. first, the feasibility of deriving a simplified mt model for long-term dynamic analysis of the distribution network is discussed, based on the physical understanding of dynamic processes that occurred within mts. then a three-stage identification method is developed in order to obtain a piecewise mt model and predict electro-mechanical system behaviors with saturation. next, assisted with the electric power flow calculation tool, a fast simulation methodology is proposed to evaluate the long-term impact of multiple mts on the distribution network. finally, the model is verified by using capstone 00 micro turbine experiments, and further applied to the dynamic simulation of a modified ieee 37-node test feeder with promising results.

system_identification	the paper develops a methodology that uses the thermoeconomic functional diagram applied for allocating cost of products obtained by the plant and afterwards demonstrates how it is possible to calculate the marginal cost in us$/kw h of the production. the methodology which was adopted includes the plant exergetic analysis development, the function system identification through physical diagram of the plant, construction of the thermoeconomic functional diagram and the determination of the expressions for the plant 's exergetic functions. the methodology also includes the determination of some parameters such as, investments, maintenance, operation, raw materials (canola oil, catalysts, methanol, glycerine and natural gas) and utility costs (electricity and steam water). as a result, it can be said that the simultaneously production of biodiesel and hydrogen is a suitable technology to minimize biodiesel production cost. about 6% of the thermoeconomic cost of biodiesel production was diminished when compared to the values previolisly published in the present literature. in relation to the hydrogen production thermoeconomic costs, the values are closer when they are compared to the ones which were identified in the literature. as a contribution to the scientific knowledge, it can be said that the obtained results shows the high performance of simultaneous biodiesel and hydrogen production, especially when glycerine is further processed into valuable energetic matter, in other words, considering economic aspects associated with the exergy conception, in order to develop a tool to assist the equipment operation, as well as to optimize the biodiesel plant design. also shows that in a biodiesel production plant the hydrogen technology is more sustainable than the traditional one. the paper aims to innovate the production process of biodiesel by incorporating the hydrogen production process through glycerine steam reforming.

electrical_circuits	at a singular point of a dae, the ivp fails to have a unique solution. hence, numerical integration methods cannot provide reasonable results. unfortunately, common error control strategies do not always detect these circumstances and arbitrary solutions may be given to the user without warnings of any kind. automatic (or algorithmic) differentiation (ad) opens new possibilities to realize an analysis of daes and to monitor assumptions required for the existence and uniqueness of ivps. we show how the diagnosis of singular points can be performed for structured quasi-linear daes up to index 2. our approach uses the projector based analysis for daes employing ad. the resulting method is illustrated by several examples, with particular emphasis on simple electrical circuits containing controlled sources.
digital_control	our aim of the project is to demonstrate all the protections and interlocks available in the critical equipments of power station such as boiler, turbine, the alternator, and how these critical equipments are protected from abnormal conditions and parameters. the failure of any one of these equipments will lead to loss of power generation. the cost of these equipments is huge. boiler has got protection against abnormal drum level, abnormal live steam pressure, abnormal live steam temperature, abnormal furnace pressure. turbine has got protection against abnormal condenser vacuum, abnormal lubricating oil pressure, abnormal axial shiftand abnormal turbine speed. similarly the generator has also got the following protections 1.10.5kv earth fault, 220kv earth fault, differential protection, incomplete phase condition, rotor earth fault, stator inter turn fault, over current protection, stator overvoltage, rotor overvoltage. these protections are classified as class a, class b and class c protections. distributed digital controls and numerical protections relays play vital role in providing protections to critical equipments to demonstrate these protections in real sense in our project kit. however an effort has been made to demonstrate the functioning of these protections with the aid of a programmable logic controller. also a few suggestions to improve the existing system are also discussed.
pid_controller	a novel closed-loop process is demonstrated to control deposition microstructure during laser additive manufacturing (lam) in real-time. an infrared imaging system is developed to monitor surface temperatures during the process as feedback signals. cooling rates and melt pool temperatures are recorded in real-time to provide adequate information regarding thermal gradients, and thus control the deposition microstructure affected by cooling rates during lam. using correlations between the cooling rate, traveling speed, and the clad microstructure, a novel feedback pid controller is established to control the cooling rate. the controller is designed to maintain the cooling rate around a desired point by tuning the traveling speed. the performance of the controller is examined on several single-track and multi-track closed-loop claddings in order to achieve desired microstructures with specific properties. results indicate that the closed-loop controller is capable of generating a consistent controlled microstructure during the lam process in real-time.
digital_control	direct model predictive power control (dmppc) has emerged as a viable alternative for grid-tied active front end (afe) power converters. however, its one-switching-vectorper-sampling-interval character leads to big ripples in its control variables. this work proposes a performance-enhanced direct multiple-vector model predictive power control (dmv-mppc) solution for grid-tied afes directly implementable on an fpga. the proposed control scheme is compared with the classical dmppc. the presented experimental results illustrate that the control performance can be significantly improved by the proposed dmv-mppc scheme.
state_space_representation	in this study, the stabilization problem for nonlinear multiple time-delay large-scale systems is considered. first, a neural-network (nn) model is employed to approximate each interconnected subsystem. then, a linear differential inclusion (ldi) state-space representation is established for the dynamics of the nn model. based on this ldi state-space representation, a robust fuzzy control design is proposed to overcome the effect of modeling errors between the nonlinear multiple time-delay large-scale systems and the nn models. next, in terms of lyapunov 's direct method, a delay-dependent criterion is derived in order to guarantee the stability ([tub) of nonlinear multiple time-delay large-scale systems. subsequently, the stability conditions of this criterion are reformulated into linear matrix inequalities (lmis). based on the lmis and the decentralized control scheme, a set of fuzzy controllers is then synthesized to stabilize the nonlinear large-scale system and the h-infinity control performance is achieved at the same time. if the designed fuzzy controllers cannot stabilize the nonlinear large-scale system, a batch of dithers (as the auxiliaries of fuzzy controllers) is simultaneously introduced to stabilize the nonlinear large-scale system. the injection of high-frequency signals, commonly called dithers, into nonlinear systems may improve their performance. if the frequencies of the dithers are high enough, the outputs of the dithered large-scale system and those of its corresponding mathematical model-the relaxed large-scale system can be made as close as desired. this makes it possible to obtain a rigorous prediction of the stability of the dithered large-scale system by establishing that of the relaxed large-scale system. finally, a numerical example with simulations is provided to illustrate the feasibility of our approach.
electric_motor	the paper presents a measurement campaign (electrical, thermal and user comfort) for the performance characterization of energy storage systems in real-world electric bicycles. specific sensors were added to characterize three vehicles which differ for electric motor, energy storage system size and control strategies. the controller can implement energy recovery strategies when braking and change the level of electric assistance depending on the desired trade-off between the comfort of the driver and the battery duration. experimental results show that a control strategy aiming at preserving the soc (state-of-charge), together with regenerative braking, can ensure very long battery duration with no need of recharge. the soc is kept at about 50% for a long period. instead, control strategies optimizing the full comfort of the driver by maximizing the level of assistance can ensure real-world e-bicycle missions of about 2 h and 40 km, when the soc of the battery drops down from 95% to 5%.
microcontroller	localization and tracking of resources on construction jobsites are an emerging area where the location of materials, labor, and equipment is used to estimate productivity, measure project 's progress and/or enhance jobsite safety. gps has been widely used for outdoor tracking of construction operations. however, gps is not suitable for indoor applications due to the lack of signal coverage; particularly inside tunnels or buildings. several indoor localization research studies had been attempted, however such developments rely heavily on extensive external communication network infrastructures. these developments also are susceptible to electromagnetic interference in noisy construction jobsites. this paper presents indoor localization system using a microcontroller equipped with an inertial measurement unit (imu). the imu contains a cluster of sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. the microcontroller uses a direct cosine matrix algorithm to fuse sensors data and calculate non-gravitational acceleration using nine-degrees-of-freedom motion equations. current position is calculated based on measured acceleration and heading, while accounting for growing error in speed estimation utilizing jerk integration algorithm. experimental results are presented to illustrate the relative effectiveness of the developed system, which is able to operate independently of any external aids and visibility conditions.

microcontroller	in this paper, we present a hardware/software coattack to hijack a program flow on microcontrollers. the basic idea is to skip a few instructions using multiple fault injection in microcontrollers in cooperation with a software attack. we focus on buffer overflow (bof) attacks together with such multiple fault injection. the proposed attack can be applied to a program code with a typical software countermeasure against bof attacks. the attack manipulates the program control flowby skipping specific instructions related to the countermeasure, and thus, the subsequent bof attack code is successfully executed on the microcontroller. we show the effectiveness of our proposed attack through experiments using an 8-bit avr atmega163 microcontroller and a 32-bit arm cortex-m0+ microcontroller, where the target software was equipped with a countermeasure limiting the size of user input against bof attacks. the result showed that our attack can overwrite a return address stored in a stack and call an arbitrary malicious function. we also propose a software countermeasure against our attack and prove its validity by examining all the possible instruction skips.
digital_control	a monolithic integrated low-voltage deep brain stimulator with wireless power and data transmission is presented. data and power are transmitted to the stimulator by mutual inductance coupling, while the in-vitro controller encodes the stimulation parameters. the stimulator integrates the digital control module and can generate the bipolar current with equal amplitude in four channels. in order to reduce power consumption, a novel controlled threshold voltage cancellation rectifier is proposed in this paper to provide the supply voltage of the stimulator. the monolithic stimulator was fabricated in a smic 0.18 mu m 1-poly 6-metal mixed-signal cmos process, occupying 0.23 mm(2), and consumes 180 mu w on average. compared with previously published stimulators, this design has advantages of large stimulated current (0-0.8 ma) with the double low-voltage supply (1.8 and 3.3 v), and high-level integration.
electric_motor	a complete numerical dynamic analysis of reciprocating compressor mechanism is presented, coupling the instantaneous pressure in the compression chamber, the electric motor torque and the hydrodynamic reactions, which arise from the piston and crankshaft secondary movements. additionally, non-constant crankshaft angular velocity and the piston and crankshaft misalignment torques have also been considered. two sensitivity analyses have been carried out to prove that neither the inertial forces in the directions of the secondary movements, nor the oscillations of the angular velocity produce significant differences in the compressor behaviour. finally, a set of parametric studies has been developed to evaluate the influence of geometrical parameters in the stability of the secondary movements, the friction power losses and the compressor consumption.
electrical_network	in this paper, the effects of shunt capacitor on electrical network integrated with renewable energy resources are investigated. for this proposes, we conduct 24-hours load flow analyses for ieee 39 buses power system containing intermittent renewable sources modeled by hourly generation profiles during a day using matlab program, and then shunt capacitor connected to the selected load buses on systems and power factor changes in buses are evaluated during a day.
microcontroller	a simplified, highly reliable, cost effective high temperature (rt-1373 k) vertical dilatometer system, based on linear variable differential transformer (lvdt) has been designed, fabricated and tested for measurement of linear thermal dilation of solid samples. unique features of this fully automated pc-controlled system are: simple design, fabrication from locally available components, ease of operation and maintenance, good temperature resolution (1 k), wide measurement range (+/- 1 mm, with 100 nm resolution), microcontroller-based data acquisition hardware and a simple windows-based software. the system has been tested for its performance using nist sapphire reference and high purity metals including aluminum and nickel. overall accuracy of the system for measurement of linear thermal dilation is within 3% of the reported values for nist sapphire. the system is a good example of a simple experimental facility for routine thermal expansion characterization of solids. combination of simplified design, automation and reliable performance without using sophisticated instrumentation/control systems makes it a novel cost effective thermo-analytical equipment, which can be put to widespread routine usage for researchers, academy and small/medium-scale industries.

state_space_representation	a method of chemistry tabulation combined with presumed probability density function (pdf) is applied to simulate piloted premixed jet burner flames with high karlovitz number using large eddy simulation. thermo-chemistry states are tabulated by the combination of auto-ignition and extended auto-ignition model. to evaluate the predictive capability of the proposed tabulation method to represent the thermo-chemistry states under the condition of different fresh gases temperature, a-priori study is conducted by performing idealised transient one-dimensional premixed flame simulations. presumed pdf is used to involve the interaction of turbulence and flame with beta pdf to model the reaction progress variable distribution. two presumed pdf models, dirichlet distribution and independent beta distribution, respectively, are applied for representing the interaction between two mixture fractions that are associated with three inlet streams. comparisons of statistical results show that two presumed pdf models for the two mixture fractions are both capable of predicting temperature and major species profiles, however, they are shown to have a significant effect on the predictions for intermediate species. an analysis of the thermo-chemical state-space representation of the sub-grid scale (sgs) combustion model is performed by comparing correlations between the carbon monoxide mass fraction and temperature. the sgs combustion model based on the proposed chemistry tabulation can reasonably capture the peak value and change trend of intermediate species. aspects regarding model extensions to adequately predict the peak location of intermediate species are discussed.
electrical_network	microgrid protection schemes are different from those used in conventional distribution networks. with the incorporation of distributed generation (dg), and the ability for bi-directional power flow and island operation; the fault current and delay parameters of protective relays need to be recalculated and updated in response to the dynamic operation of microgrid. performance evaluation (e.g. fault clearance time and recovery time) and parameter estimation (fault current and trip delay) for such a protection scheme have been difficult because they require comprehensive modeling of electrical network, ied behaviors, and iec61850-based communication. in this paper, we present a centralized scheme with detailed modeling and co-simulation of all these aspects. we also demonstrate how the analysis of the simulation results helps overcoming the forth-mentioned difficulties.
electrical_network	carriers of the fragile x premutation (fpm) have cgg trinucleotide repeat expansions of between 55 and 200 in the 5'-utr of fmr1, compared to a cgg repeat length of between 5 and 54 for the general population. carriers were once thought to be without symptoms, but it is now recognized that they can develop a variety of early neurological symptoms as well as being at risk for developing the late onset neurodegenerative disorder fragile x-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (fxtas). several mouse models have contributed to our understanding of fpm and fxtas, and findings from studies using these models are summarized here. this review also discusses how this information is improving our understanding of the molecular and cellular abnormalities that contribute to neurobehavioral features seen in some fpm carriers and in patients with fxtas. mouse models show much of the pathology seen in fpm carriers and in individuals with fxtas, including the presence of elevated levels of fmr1 mrna, decreased levels of fragile x mental retardation protein, and ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions. abnormalities in dendritic spine morphology in several brain regions are associated with neurocognitive deficits in spatial and temporal memory processes, impaired motor performance, and altered anxiety. in vitro studies have identified altered dendritic and synaptic architecture associated with abnormal ca2+ dynamics and electrical network activity. fpm mice have been particularly useful in understanding the roles of fmr1 mrna, fragile x mental retardation protein, and translation of a potentially toxic polyglycine peptide in pathology. finally, the potential for using these and emerging mouse models for preclinical development of therapies to improve neurological function in fxtas is considered.
analog_signal_processing	miniaturization of the electronic devices has steadily reduced both the size and the cost. but a power density of battery has not increased a lot. batteries are a prime agent to penetrate and expand of ubiquitous life. but their intrinsically low energy densities and short lifetimes impose a fundamental limitation. due to this reasons, a small linear reciprocating engine and electric generator are designed for a portable power pack in this paper. if an engine is used solely to produce electrical power in a portable power pack, it is not necessary to convert the reciprocating linear motion of the piston to rotary motion. instead, a linear electrical generator may be coupled directly to the piston for a conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy. such a design has many advantages such as mechanical simplicity and low friction and it can make possible a small engine having high efficiency.
electrical_circuits	energy harvesting is now an established field, and the linear equivalent circuit models for single-and multiple-degree-of-freedom systems are being routinely used to assess the energy harvesting efficiency of various interface and electronic circuits. however, as the field of energy harvesting moves toward more complex systems such as nonlinear energy harvesting and fluidic energy harvesting, modified equivalent circuits are required to effectively capture the behavior of these devices. this article presents two general methods (a system-level approach and a dependent source equivalent approach) that can adequately model the behavior of more advanced harvesters. these approaches can also be easily used to model single-and multiple-degree-of-freedom linear harvesters. equivalent circuits for both piezoelectric and electromagnetic harvesters are discussed. four case studies are presented to illustrate the application of these equivalent circuit approaches including the following: (1) a piezoelectric duffing harvester, (2) an electromagnetic duffing harvester, (3) a simplified aeroelastic harvester, and (4) a piezoelectric duffing harvester with a rectifier circuit.
electric_motor	grid-enabled vehicles (gevs) such as plug-in electric vehicles present environmental and energy sustainability advantages compared to conventional vehicles. gev runs solely on power generated by its own battery group, which supplies power to its electric motor. this battery group can be charged from external electric sources. nowadays, the interaction of gev with the power grid is unidirectional by the charging process. however, gev can be operated bi-directionally by modifying its power unit. in such operating conditions, gev can operate as an uninterruptible power supply (ups) and satisfy a portion or the total energy demand of the consumption center independent from utility grid, which is known as vehicle-to-home (v2h). in this paper, a power unit is developed for gevs in the laboratory to conduct simulation and experimental studies to test the performance of gevs as a ups unit in v2h mode at the time of need. the activation and deactivation of the power unit and islanding protection unit are examined when energy is interrupted.
electrical_network	this paper presents a fast and accurate approach for the dynamic electrothermal analysis of photovoltaic (pv) plants with a cell-level discretization. a circuit model is developed for the elementary cell, and an equivalent electrical network is automatically built in a preprocessing stage to account for the power-temperature feedback. the pv plant under analysis is represented as an electrical macrocircuit that can be solved with low cpu/memory requirements and without convergence issues by using any spice-like simulator. the proposed strategy can be successfully exploited for diagnostic purposes.
electrical_circuits	in the paper, mathematical models of the supercapacitors are investigated. the models are based on electrical circuits in the form of rc ladder networks. the elementary cell of the network may consist of resistances and capacitances that are connected in series or parallel. the dynamic behavior of the circuit is described using fractional-order differential equations and its properties are analyzed. the identification procedure with quadratic performance index is performed in time domain to identify the parameters of the supercapacitor models. the results of numerical simulations are compared with the results measured experimentally in the physical system. in addition, an example from the automotive industry is used for an experimental evaluation of the theoretical analysis and to present a perspective on the applicability of the approach for other industrial projects.
signal-flow_graph	a systematic design approach using signal flow graph (sfg) is presented in this paper, tailored for integrated reconfigurable switched-capacitor (sc) power converters. to achieve an optimal power stage, an unified signal flow graph (usfg) model is developed. system transfer function and i/o impedance can be evaluated based on it. to verify the design approach, the paper demonstrates a step-up/down reconfigurable sc power converter with five optional gain ratios. a dual-loop control scheme is employed to reconfigure the converter according to the instantaneous line/load conditions. a low-power, digital controller is designed in the subthreshold region for the feedback control loop. the converter was fabricated with a 130-nm cmos process. experimental results show that its output can be continuously regulated from 0.4 to 2.2 v, while allowing the input voltage to randomly vary between 0.9 and 1.5 v. the line regulation is maintained below 1.4%, with a lowest value of 0.07%. the maximum efficiency of 90.22% is measured at 0.55-v output voltage and 20-mw load.
pid_controller	hydraulic turbine governing system (htgs) is a complicated nonlinear system, which regulates frequency and power of hydropower generating unit. in previous study, control model of htgs is always overly simplified and the elastic water hammer model is seldom considered. in this paper, a nonlinear htgs model with elastic water hammer effect has been studied and a fuzzy-pid controller is designed to improve control quality of this system. in order to optimize the fuzzy-pid controller, a novel gravitational search algorithm based on cauchy mutation and mass weighing (gsa-cw) has been proposed with two improvements: a weighting strategy is designed to accelerate the convergence by assigning weights to agents in mass calculation; a combined mutation strategy based on cauchy and gaussian distribution is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation ability of the proposed algorithm. at first, the searching ability of the gsa-cw has been verified on a set of 13 complex benchmark functions by statistical analysis. and then, the gsa-cw is applied to optimize the fuzzy-pid controller, while different meta-heuristics and different pid controllers are employed for comparison. experimental results indicate that the fuzzy-pid controller optimized by the gsa-cw is more effective to improve the control quality of the nonlinear htgs.

electricity	the objectives of the nuclear fusion power plant demo, to be built after the iter experimental reactor, are usually understood to lie somewhere between those of iter and a 'first of a kind' commercial plant. hence, in demo the issues related to efficiency and rami (reliability, availability, maintainability and inspectability) are among the most important drivers for the design, as the cost of the electricity produced by this power plant will strongly depend on these aspects. in the framework of the eurofusion work package heating and current drive within the power plant physics and development activities, a conceptual design of the neutral beam injector (nbi) for the demo fusion reactor has been developed by consorzio rfx in collaboration with other european research institutes. in order to improve efficiency and rami aspects, several innovative solutions have been introduced in comparison to the iter nbi, mainly regarding the beam source, neutralizer and vacuum pumping systems.
signal-flow_graph	wavelet transform algorithm has emphasized the research attention for its ability to study transient signal analysis. this has incredible applications in pattern recognition and image processing. rn this paper, mathematical formulations of wavelet transform have been developed for multiprocessor applications, the signal flow graph of the algorithm has been designed for the multiresolution level wavelet transform. the pow graph has been modeled for implementation on multiprocessors connected through de bruijn graph. the modeling results are derived in terms of computation time, speedup and efficiency.
control_engineering	in order to get the unbiased parameter estimation of transfer function from noisy input and output data, this paper presents an auxiliary model based method. the basic idea is to replace the unmeasurable outputs in the information vector of the system by auxiliary model outputs, and to modify the recursive least squares parameter estimation by the errors between the system output and auxiliary model output. the proposed method improves the precision of parameter estimates, and has wide application in modelling and control engineering without strict mathematical assumption. finally, the advantages of the proposed approach are shown by simulation tests.

electricity	the trend toward a more fiercely competitive and strictly environmentally regulated electricity market in several countries, including china has led to efforts by both industry and government to develop advanced performance evaluation models that adapt to new evaluation requirements. traditional operational and environmental efficiency measures do not fully consider the influence of market competition and environmental regulations and, thus, are not sufficient for the thermal power industry to evaluate its operational performance with respect to specific marketing goals (operational effectiveness) and its environmental performance with respect to specific emissions reduction targets (environmental effectiveness). as a complement to an operational efficiency measure, an operational effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to increase its electricity generation through the improvement of operational efficiency, but it also reflects the system 's capability to adjust its electricity generation activities to match electricity demand. in addition, as a complement to an environmental efficiency measure, an environmental effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to decrease its pollutant emissions through the improvement of environmental efficiency, but it also reflects the system 's capability to adjust its emissions abatement activities to fulfill environmental regulations. furthermore, an environmental effectiveness measure helps the government regulator to verify the rationality of its emissions reduction targets assigned to the thermal power industry. several newly developed effectiveness measurements based on data envelopment analysis (dea) were utilized in this study to evaluate the operational and environmental performance of the thermal power industry in china during 2006-2013. both efficiency and effectiveness were evaluated from the three perspectives of operational, environmental, and joint adjustments to each electricity production system. the operational and environmental performance changes over time were also captured through an effectiveness measure based on the global malmquist productivity index. our empirical results indicated that the performance of china 's thermal power industry experienced significant progress during the study period and that policies regarding the development and regulation of the thermal power industry yielded the expected effects. however, the emissions reduction targets assigned to china 's thermal power industry are loose and conservative.

system_identification	a comparative study of different models and identification techniques applied to the quantification of valve stiction in industrial control loops is presented in this paper, with the objective of taking into account for the presence of external disturbances. a hammerstein system is used to model the controlled process (linear block) and the sticky valve (nonlinear block): five different candidates for the linear block and two different candidates for the nonlinear block are evaluated and compared. two of the five linear models include a nonstationary disturbance term that is estimated along with the input-to-output model, and these extended models are meant to cope with situations in which significant nonzero mean disturbances affect the collected data. the comparison of the different models and identification methods is carried out thoroughly in three steps: simulation, application to pilot plant data and application to industrial loops. in the first two cases (simulation and pilot plant) the specific source of fault (stiction with/without external disturbances) is known and hence a validation of each candidate can be carried out more easily. nonetheless, each fault case considered in the previous two steps has been found in the application to a large number of datasets collected from industrial loops, and hence the merits and limitations of each candidate have been confirmed. as a result of this study, extended models are proved to be effective when large, time varying disturbances affect the system, whereas conventional (stationary) noise models are more effective elsewhere.

electricity	the economics of establishing perennial species as renewable energy feedstocks has been widely investigated as a climate change adapted diversification option for landholders, primarily using net present value (npv) analysis. npv does not account for key uncertainties likely to influence relevant landholder decision making. while real options analysis (roa) is an alternative method that accounts for the uncertainty over future conditions and the large upfront irreversible investment involved in establishing perennials, there have been limited applications of roa to evaluating land use change decision economics and even fewer applications considering climate change risks. further, while the influence of spatially varying climate risk on biomass conversion economic has been widely evaluated using npv methods, effects of spatial variability and climate on land use change have been scarcely assessed with roa. in this study we applied a simulation-based roa model to evaluate a landholder 's decision to convert land from agriculture to biomass. this spatially explicit model considers price and yield risks under baseline climate and two climate change scenarios over a geographically diverse farming region. we found that underlying variability in primary productivity across the study area had a substantial effect on conversion thresholds required to trigger land use change when compared to results from npv analysis. areas traditionally thought of as being quite similar in average productive capacity can display large differences in response to the inclusion of production and price risks. the effects of climate change, broadly reduced returns required for land use change to biomass in low and medium rainfall zones and increased them in higher rainfall areas. additionally, the risks posed by climate change can further exacerbate the tendency for npv methods to underestimate true conversion thresholds. our results show that even under severe drying and warming where crop yield variability is more affected than perennial biomass plantings, comparatively little of the study area is economically viable for conversion to biomass under $200/dm t, and it is not until prices exceed $200/dm t that significant areas become profitable for biomass plantings. we conclude that for biomass to become a valuable diversification option the synchronisation of products and services derived from biomass and the development of markets is vital.

system_identification	this paper addresses the identification of switched linear mimo state-space systems. the proposed methodology explores the use of subspace identification techniques, clustering, and data classification to obtain an estimate of the submodels. the main contribution of this work lies in the inclusion of an identification step of points generated by the same mode. for this points classification it is proposed to use a hybrid filtering technique known as interacting multiple model (imm) algorithm. an important feature of the overall identification algorithm is that the matrices of different submodels can be directly combined because, they are obtained for the same state-space basis. the efficiency of the developed method is demonstrated via numerical examples.
electrical_network	distributed generation (dg) brought new challenges for protection engineers since standard relay settings of traditional system may no longer function correctly under the new conditions of dg. the extreme case is coordination loss between primary and backup relays. the directional overcurrent relay (docr) which is the most implemented protection device in the electrical network also suffers performance degradation in presence of dg. therefore, the paper proposes the mitigation of dg impact on docr coordination employing adaptive protection scheme (aps) using differential evolution algorithm (de). the impacts of dg prior and after the application of aps are presented and a new mitigation scheme is proposed.
digital_control	the efforts for more reliable power conversion systems have been gaining momentum in recent years. the majority of the studies concerning reliability of power switches focus on the package-related failures, mainly caused by the cyclic thermal stress. the basic failure precursor for this type of stress has been identified as increased on-state resistance for power mosfets in the recent literature. on-state resistance monitoring during converter operation is a challenging and costly task as it requires current and voltage sensing circuits, which can block the high voltage across the switch during off-state to protect the measurement or control unit. this paper proposes a software frequency response analysis method to determine the health status of high-voltage power mosfets with high on-state resistance. this is achieved by analyzing and evaluating the variation in the plant model at double pole frequency using the same dsp that is used for control purposes. the proposed concept is analyzed for boost converter; however, it can be used to detect the on-state resistance variation in other types of converters operating in continuous condition mode (ccm). the proposed algorithm is embedded in a low cost dsp and experimentally verified on a dc/dc boost converter.

microcontroller	a new technique to measure a capacitor or a capacitive sensor by means of a direct sensor-to-microcontroller interface circuit that does not need a calibration capacitor is proposed. basically, the measurement process consists of three consecutive steps of charge, discharge and charge of the capacitor under test. a non-linear equation is obtained and solved that is dependent only on known circuit parameters. experimental results show that it is possible to measure a wide range of capacitor values with a maximum deviation of 2% from the reference value, and that temperature changes from 18 to 70 degrees c yield relative errors below 0.1%. for the lowest measured capacitor range (33 pf-4.7 nf) the uncertainty holds below 1 pf which enables measurement of commercially available capacitive sensors. the main advantage of the proposed technique is cost and space reduction of the final design.
analog_signal_processing	with higher rate of depletion of the non-renewable fuels, the quest for an appropriate alternative fuel has gathered great momentum. though diesel engines are the most trusted power sources in the transportation industry, due to stringent emission norms and rapid depletion of petroleum resources there has been a continuous effort to use alternative fuels. hydrogen is one of the best alternatives for conventional fuels. hydrogen has its own benefits and limitations in its use as a conventional fuel in automotive engine system. in the present investigation, hydrogen-enriched air is used as intake charge in a diesel engine adopting exhaust gas recirculation (egr) technique with hydrogen flow rate at 201/min. experiments are conducted in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, direct-injection diesel engine coupled to an electrical generator. performance parameters such as specific energy consumption, brake thermal efficiency are determined and emissions such as oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, smoke and exhaust gas temperature are measured. usage of hydrogen in dual fuel mode with egr technique results in lowered smoke level, particulate and no, emissions.

electrical_circuits	capacitance limits the bandwidth of engineered and biological electrical circuits because it determines the gain-bandwidth product (gbwp). with a fixed gbwp, bandwidth can only be improved by decreasing gain. in engineered circuits, an inductance reduces this limitation through shunt peaking but no equivalent mechanism has been reported for biological circuits. we show that in blowfly photoreceptors a voltage-dependent k+ conductance, the fast delayed rectifier (fdr), produces shunt peaking thereby increasing bandwidth without reducing gain. furthermore, the fdr 's time constant is close to the value that maximizes the photoreceptor gbwp while reducing distortion associated with the creation of a wide-band filter. using a model of the honeybee drone photoreceptor, we also show that a voltage-dependent na+ conductance can produce shunt peaking. we argue that shunt peaking may be widespread in graded neurons and dendrites.

operational_amplifier	this paper presents a low-power, low-noise and high precision operational amplifier for a tracking system containing the intelligent medical device, and is an extended version of paper previously published by nenadovic et al. in proc. of icecs 2014. the accuracy of the tracking system strongly depends on the accurate amplitude acquisition of the received signal. therefore, an operational amplifier with precise gain control and effective temperature compensation has been designed and fabricated. the operational amplifier provides linear and temperature independent signal amplification at frequencies between 0.2 and 20 khz at a body temperature. the amplifier shows measured gain over temperature sensitivity as low as 32 ppm/a degrees c in temperature range from 20 to 40 a degrees c and consumes 300 mu a from a supply voltage of 2.5 v. furthermore, the measured gain over temperature sensitivity in the range from -40 to 130 a degrees c is only 60 ppm/a degrees c. simulated linearity for signal amplitudes up to 10 mv is 0.4 % and the input-referred noise at 1 khz is 32 nv/aehz. an open-loop gain of 46 db at 1 khz and bandwidth-gain product of 4.8 mhz is measured. the operational amplifier was designed in ihps 250 nm sige bicmos technology and occupies an area of 0.2 mm(2).
lorentz_force_law	this paper presents the controller design and implementation of a high-precision 6-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) magnetically levitated (maglev) positioner. this high-precision positioning system consists of a novel concentrated-field magnet matrix and a triangular single-moving part that carries three 3-phase permanent-magnet linear-levitation-motor armatures. since only a single levitated moving part, namely the platen, generates all required fine and coarse motions, this positioning system is reliable and low-cost. three planar levitation motors based on the lorentz-force law not only generate the vertical force to levitate the triangular platen but control the platen 's position and orientation in the horizontal plane. all 6-dof motions are controlled by magnetic forces only. the platen is regarded a pure mass system, and the spring and damping coefficients are neglected except for the vertical directions. single-input single-output (siso) digital lead-lag controllers are designed and implemented on a digital signal processor (dsp). this 6-dof fully magnetically levitated positioner has a total mass of 5.91 kg and currently exhibits a 120 mm x 120 mm travel range. this positioner is highly suitable for semiconductor-manufacturing applications such as wafer steppers, several experimental motion profiles are presented to demonstrate the maglev stage 's capability of accurately tracking any planar and 3-d paths.
electrical_network	this paper presents the convergence analysis of seidel method for solving power systems automatic tasks. in a condition of use of programmable logical controllers with low capacity as a hardware, algorithm solution based on seidel method have some advantages, such as memory saving. however, there are some limits for seidel method convergence. if the electrical network condition is close to resonance there will be no assurance that seidel method will converge. as a result of made experiments we can conclude that usage of relaxation method in conjunction with convergence control on the phase plane allows to solve network analysis problem with nonexpansible hardware.

state_space_representation	the pull-in range of phase locked loop (pll) is a key parameter for evaluating the performance of the pll circuit. it is defined as the maximum detuning frequency range where the loop locks. different methods have been proposed for computing the pull-in range of phase locked loops in the absence of time delay. in this paper, the effect of time delay on the pull-in range of second-order phase locked loop as well as its dynamical behavior will be discussed. the time delay is modeled using first order pade approximation. using pade approximation, the nonlinear second order delay differential equation which describes the phase error dynamic of the pll is transformed into fourth order system in the state space representation. the new time-delay pll model is simulated and different behavior is observed which is different than a typical pll system without delay. as the gain of the loop increases, new behavior such as change of circuit stability and chaos are recognized which suggests that the gain of the loop cannot be arbitrary large. we compare the pull-in range of a time delay pll with those without time delay. results demonstrate the degradation in the pull-in range for the time delay pll. moreover, result shows that the pull in range gets narrower as time delay increases.
signal-flow_graph	a technique for designing square-root domain elliptic filters that simulate the operation of the corresponding lc ladder prototypes is introduced in this paper. this is achieved by manipulating the equations that describe the operation of differentiation in such a way that only lossless integrator and weighted summation blocks are needed. the derived signal flow graph (sfg) is transposed to the corresponding one in the square-root domain using an appropriate set of operators in order to preserve the linear operation of the whole filter. in order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique, a third-order elliptic lowpass filter was simulated and its behavior was evaluated using an hspice simulator.
pid_controller	this paper presents the effects on output voltage and current total harmonic distortion (thd) response with increasing the arm inductance (smooth reactor for hvdc) for the modular multilevel converter (mmc) behavior based on a closed loop-needless pid controller control. also, it presents the effects on mmc quantities, such as a circulating current ripple, maximum output voltage, and submodule capacitor ripple responses with increasing the value of arm inductance. because increasing arm inductor size could reduce the thd and circulating current ripple waveforms of the mmc, this effect will be investigated in this paper. the closed loop-needless pid controller control is presented first. second, an examination of the effect of changing the arm inductor for mmc behavior is carried out based on many simulation results in this paper in order to analyze the change in thd for all mmc quantities, including circulating current, upper arm current and voltage, lower arm current and voltage, and ac output voltage and current. third, arm inductance relationships with output voltage and current thd are shown. also, arm inductance relationships with a circulating current ripple and submodule capacitor ripple are presented. as a part of this study, the relationship between arm inductance and maximum output voltage is explained. finally, the hardware design and software design of the prototype are presented to verify the arm inductor value effect on mmc experimentally. the experimental results are also documented in this paper.

state_space_representation	nonlinear adaptive filtering techniques for system identification (based on the volterra model) are widely used for the identification of nonlinearities in many applications. in this correspondence, the improved tracking capability of a numeric variable forgetting factor recursive least squares (nvff-rls) algorithm is presented for first-order and second-order time-varying volterra systems under a nonstationary environment. the nonlinear system tracking problem is converted into a state estimation problem of the time-variant system. the time-varying volterra kernels are governed by the first-order gauss-markov stochastic difference equation, upon which the state-space representation of this system is built. in comparison to the conventional fixed forgetting factor recursive least squares algorithm, the nvff-rls algorithm provides better channel estimation as well as channel tracking performance in terms of the minimum mean square error (mmse) for first-order and second-order volterra systems. the nvff-rls algorithm is adapted to the time-varying signals by using the updating prediction error criterion, which accounts for the nonstationarity of the signal. the demonstrated simulation results manifest that the proposed method has good adaptability in the time-varying environment, and it also reduces the computational complexity.
control_engineering	high-performance control of quantum dynamics is key to the development of quantum technologies. from quantum-state engineering to quantum metrology, theory and practice of quantum control enable robust and cheaper technologies for future industrial applications. starting from fundamental matter-field interactions, we overview various approaches to modelling quantum control systems, in which control can be implemented by either changing field or material properties. these models are built in time or frequency domain and can be interconnected to form quantum feedback networks. this review can be taken as a useful reference for engineers to understand the quantum physics behind, or for physicists to resolve control problems from a control engineering point of view.

operational_amplifier	in comparison with conventional operational amplifier, ring amplifier can achieve better power efficiency for switched capacitor circuits. however, the cascade-inverter architecture of ring amplifier may suffer from undesirable oscillation which has a great impact on transient stability. this paper presents a latched-based ring amplifier which is capable of decreasing the probability of oscillation. besides, two auto-zero schemes are employed in different pipelined stages to reduce the common-mode voltage offset and to increase the stability. the prototype adc was fabricated in a 90-nm cmos technology. the measured sndr and sfdr are 52.06 db and 63.15 db, respectively, for a nyquist frequency input sampled at 35 ms/s, and the adc consumes 3.65 mw.
operational_amplifier	this paper proposes a macromodel to emulate the nonlinear behavior of current-feedback operational amplifiers (cfoas) at low-frequency. the main difference between this macromodel and those reported previously in the literature is that herein, real physical active device performance parameters along with parasitic elements associated to the input-output terminals of the amplifier are considered. to validate the deduced behavioral model, a saturated nonlinear function series (snfs) based on cfoas is built and numerical simulations are generated. in this point, the modeling problem is cast in terms of an augmented set of equations but that, unlike a piece-wise linear (pwl) approach, the dynamic behavior of each cfoa is considered. afterwards, the snfs is experimentally tested by using commercially available active devices, confirming good agreement among theoretical simulations and experimental tests at two operating frequencies and showing a better accuracy compared with a pwl approach and a linear model for cfoas. because the derived nonlinear macromodel for cfoas is used for generating the behavioral model of the snfs, one concludes that the latter is also both accurate and efficient with respect to traditional techniques, such as pwl approaches.

electric_motor	designing efficient transmission mechanisms for advanced satellite networks is a demanding task, requiring the definition and the implementation of protocols and architectures well suited to this challenging environment. in particular, transport protocols performance over satellite networks is impaired by the characteristics of the satellite radio link, specifically by the long propagation delay and the possible presence of segment losses due to physical channel errors. the level of impact on performance depends upon the link design (type of constellation, link margin, coding and modulation) and operational conditions (link obstructions, terminal mobility, weather conditions, etc.). to address these critical aspects a number of possible solutions have been presented in the literature, ranging from limited modifications of standard protocols (e.g. tcp, transmission control protocol) to completely alternative protocol and network architectures. however, despite the great number of different proposals (or perhaps also because of it), the general framework appears quite fragmented and there is a compelling need of an integration of the research competences and efforts. this is actually the intent of the transport protocols research line within the european satnex (satellite network of excellence) project. stemming from the authors' work on this project, this paper aims to provide the reader with an updated overview of all the possible approaches that can be pursued to overcome the limitations of current transport protocols and architectures, when applied to satellite communications. in the paper the possible solutions are classified in the following categories: optimization of tcp interactions with lower layers, tcp enhancements, performance enhancement proxies (pep) and delay tolerant networks (dtn). advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches, as well as their interactions, are investigated and discussed, taking into account performance improvement, complexity, and compliance to the standard semantics. from this analysis, it emerges that dtn architectures could integrate some of the most efficient solutions from the other categories, by inserting them in a new rigorous framework. these innovative architectures therefore may represent a promising solution for solving some of the important problems posed at the transport layer by satellite networks, at least in a medium-to-long-term perspective. copyright (c) 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.
state_space_representation	this paper describes an algorithm for computing the distribution of conditional forecasts, i.e., projections of a set of variables of interest on future paths of some other variables, in dynamic systems. the algorithm is based on kalman filtering methods and is computationally viable for large models that can be cast in a linear state space representation. we build large vector autoregressions (vars) and a large dynamic factor model (dfm) for a quarterly data set of 26 euro area macroeconomic and financial indicators. the two approaches deliver similar forecasts and scenario assessments. in addition, conditional forecasts shed light on the stability of the dynamic relationships in the euro area during the recent episodes of financial turmoil, and indicate that only a small number of sources drive the bulk of the fluctuations in the euro area economy.

lorentz_force_law	this paper presents the controller design and implementation of a high-precision six-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) magnetically levitated (maglev) positioner. this high-precision positioning system consists of a novel concentrated-field magnet matrix and a triangular single moving part that carries three three-phase permanent-magnet planar-levitation-motor armatures. since only a single levitated moving part, namely the platen, generates all required fine and coarse motions, this positioning system is reliable and potentially low-cost. the three planar levitation motors based on the lorentz force law not only produce the vertical force to levitate the triangular platen but also control the platen 's position and orientation in the horizontal plane. the main contribution of this paper is that all 6-dof motions are solely controlled by magnetic forces without any other means to support the platen 's weight against gravity, and the most suitable controller of the magnetic levitation system was designed and implemented. the platen can be regarded as a pure mass, and the spring and damping effects are neglected except for the vertical directions. single-input single-output digital lead-lag controllers were designed and implemented on a digital signal processor. this 6-dof fully magnetically levitated positioner has a total mass of 5.91 kg and exhibits a 120 x 120 mm maximum travel range. the position resolution of 20 nm and position noise of 10-nm root mean square are demonstrated. the positioner has sub-microradian angular resolution in about the x, y, and z-axes. a maximum velocity of 24.8 mm/s in y is achieved. this single-moving-part maglev positioner structure is highly suitable for semiconductor manufacturing applications such as wafer steppers. several experimental motion profiles are presented to demonstrate the maglev stage 's capability of accurately tracking any planar and three-dimensional paths.

system_identification	this paper proposes and studies the nonparametric system identification of a foil-air bearing (fab). this research is motivated by two advantages: (a) it removes computational limitations by replacing the air film and foil structure equations by a displacement/force relationship and (b) it can capture complications that cannot be easily modeled, if the identification is based on empirical data. a recurrent neural network (rnn) is trained to identify the full numerical model of a fab over a wide range of speeds. the variable-speed rnn-fab model is then successfully validated against benchmark results in two ways: (i) by subjecting it to different input data sets and (ii) by using it in the harmonic balance (hb) solution process for the unbalance response of a rotor-bearing system. in either case, the results from the identified variable-speed rnn maintain very good correlation with the benchmark over a wide range of speeds, in contrast to an earlier identified constant-speed rnn, demonstrating the great potential of this method in the absence of self-excitation effects.
digital_control	based on time-domain quality factor ( q-factor) measurement principle, we have proposed an architecture which has the potential to be integrated on-chip. thanks to the proposed original reconfigurable structure, the main measurement error from the offset of the operational trans conductance amplifier (ota) used can be cancelled automatically during the measurement operation, leading to a high accuracy q-factor measurement. the digital control circuit plays an important role in the automatic passage between the two configurations designed, i.e., peak detector and comparator. the main advantages of the proposed time-domain q-factor measurement lay on the possibility of being integrated next to the micro electro mechanical system (mems) resonator to be measured, the miniaturization of the whole measuring system as well as the enhancement of the measurement performance, and to guide the design of such architecture, a theoretical analysis linking the required accuracy and the given q-factor to the circuit parameters have been given in this paper. the proposed circuit is designed and simulated in a 0.35 pm complementary metal oxide semiconductors (cmos) technology. the post-layout simulation results show that the operating frequency can reach up to 200 khz with an accuracy of 0.4%.
electricity	herein a techno-economic assessment was performed on an energy-crop-based biogas plant coupled with a greenhouse for utilizing thermal energy produced by cogeneration. seven energy crops were evaluated: triticale, maize, alfalfa, sunflower, clover, barley and wheat. according to the evaluation, triticale was the most competitive energy crop under selected climate conditions for northern greece. although maize displays higher biomass yield and biogas potential than the drought-resistant crop triticale, it has high irrigation demand that contributes significantly to total production costs. for a triticale-based biogas production to become economically feasible, agricultural arable area larger than 500 ha, or biogas plant size larger than 1000 kw(el), is required. however, with public funding, biogas production becomes feasible at smaller area (>250 ha) or biogas plant size (>500 kw(el)). the inclusion of a greenhouse into the design of the biogas plant contributes positively to the economic viability of the entire system. under this scenario, greenhouse financial income accounts for about 17-18% of total income. results of a sensitivity analysis suggest that the selection of an appropriate energy crop for biogas production should be based principally on both digestibility (specific methane yield) and biomass yield per hectare, these factors being more critical than biomass production costs.
electrical_circuits	feedback indicating how well students are performing during a learning task can be very stimulating. in this study with a pre- and post-test design, the effects of two types of performance feedback on learning results were compared: feedback during a learning task was either stated in terms of how well the students were performing relative to other students (social comparison feedback) or relative to an absolute criterion (criterion-based feedback). thirty-four students in secondary vocational engineering education were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. in both conditions, students worked together in small groups. all groups completed a math learning task, during which they received either social comparison feedback or criterion-based performance feedback. the findings showed that the type of feedback had a strong effect on learning outcomes: the post-test scores and gains of students in the social comparison condition were significantly higher than those of students in the criterion-based feedback condition.

system_identification	the authors propose a diagnostic technique for the state-space model fitting of time series by deleting some observations and measuring the change in the parameter estimates. they consider this approach in order to distinguish an observational outlier from an innovational one. thus, they present a robust subspace identification algorithm that is less sensitive to outliers. a monte carlo simulation for a vibrating structure model demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its ability to detect outliers in the measurements as well as the dynamical state.
microcontroller	pilot balloon observatories of india meteorological department (avid) are using hand held data logger (hhdl), manufactured by sameer, to compute upper air data since 2007. the hhdl, which is a sleek and microcontroller based battery operated unit, accepts all information through the numeric keypad pertaining to the pb ascent for raw file generation and pilot balloon data processing. the raw file can be transferred to computer system as an input file to pc based pibal computation software. this software generates pibal messages similar to hhdl in addition to national data centre (ndc) data format and monthly climate. in case of any failure of hardware, both hhdl & pc based pibal computation software cannot be used. therefore to overcome this problem, a pc based pibal data keying software has been developed using visual c sharp. the new software, what is developed, creates an input file similar to hhdl; it was tested with pc based pibal computation software which works successfully as an alternate in case of failure of hhdl & it 's hardware accessories

digital_control	in this technical note, we first present an adaptive distributed observer for a discrete-time leader system. this adaptive distributed observer will provide, to each follower, not only the estimation of the leader 's signal, but also the estimation of the leader 's system matrix. then, based on the estimation of the matrix s, we devise a discrete adaptive algorithm to calculate the solution to the regulator equations associated with each follower, and obtain an estimated feedforward control gain. finally, we solve the cooperative output regulation problem for discrete-time linear multi-agent systems by both state feedback and output feedback adaptive distributed control laws utilizing the adaptive distributed observer.
signal-flow_graph	a new approach is proposed to improve a graphical approach with considering intensity coupling loss coefficients in the analytical derivation of the optical transfer functions for a symmetric double stage vertically coupled microring resonator. an optimum transmission coupling condition is determined with considering terms of couplers intensity loss which leads to low insertion loss of 1.2 db, finesse of 1525, the out of band rejection ratio of 61.8 db. the resonating system is used as an optical force sensing system to make the benefit of the accuracy of measurements in micro and nano scales. the sensitivity of proposed force sensor in terms of wavelength-shift is 33 nm/nn and the limit of detection is 1.6 x 10 (2) nn. the proposed sensing system has the advantages of self-calibration and the low power consumption due to the low intensity.

state_space_representation	in this paper, we present a tuning methodology for a simple offset-free siso model predictive controller (mpc) based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (arx models). arx models simplify system identification as they can be identified from data using convex optimization. furthermore, the proposed controller is simple to tune as it has only one free tuning parameter. these two features are advantageous in predictive process control as they simplify industrial commissioning of mpc. disturbance rejection and offset-free control is important in industrial process control. to achieve offset-free control in face of unknown disturbances or model-plant mismatch, integrators must be introduced in either the estimator or the regulator. traditionally, offset-free control is achieved using brownian disturbance models in the estimator. in this paper we achieve offset-free control by extending the noise model with a filter containing an integrator. this filter is a first order arma model. by simulation and analysis, we argue that it is independent of the parameterization of the underlying linear plant: while the tuning of traditional disturbance models is system dependent. using this insight, we present mpc for siso systems based on arx models combined with the first order filter. we derive expressions for the closed-loop variance of the unconstrained mpc based on a state space representation in innovation form and use these expressions to develop a tuning procedure for the regulator. we establish formal equivalence between gpc and state space based off-set free mpc. by simulation we demonstrate this procedure for a third order system. the offset-free arx mpc demonstrates satisfactory set point tracking and rejection of an unmeasured step disturbance for a simulated furnace with a long time delay.

electrical_circuits	learning the analysis of electrical circuits represented by circuit diagrams is often challenging for novice students. an open research question in electrical circuit analysis instruction is whether color coding of the mathematical symbols (variables) that denote electrical quantities can improve circuit analysis learning. the present study compared two groups of high school students undergoing their first introductory learning of electrical circuit analysis. one group learned with circuit variables in black font. the other group learned with colored circuit variables, with blue font indicating variables related to voltage, red font indicating those related to current, and black font indicating those related to resistance. the color group achieved significantly higher post-test scores, gave higher ratings for liking the instruction and finding it helpful, and had lower ratings of cognitive load than the black-font group. these results indicate that color coding of the notations for quantities in electrical circuit diagrams aids the circuit analysis learning of novice students.
digital_control	envelope tracking (et) and envelope elimination and restoration (eer) are techniques that have gained in importance in the last decade in order to obtain highly efficient radio frequency power amplifier that transmits signals with high peak-to-average power ratio. in this study, a multilevel multiphase buck converter is presented as a solution for the envelope amplifier used in et and eer. the presented multiphase buck converter generates multilevel voltage using ""node"" duty cycles and nonlinear control. in this way, the multilevel is implemented using only one simple power stage. however, the complexity of the multilevel converter implementation has been shifted from complicated power topologies to complicated digital control. detailed discussion regarding the influence of the design parameters (switching frequency, output filter, and time resolution of the digital control) on the performance of the proposed envelope amplifier is presented. the design of the output filter is conducted fulfilling the constraints of the envelope slew rate and minimum driver pulse that can be reproduced. in the cases when these two constraints cannot be fulfilled, they may be relieved by the modified control that is presented and experimentally validated. finally, in order to validate the concept, a prototype has been designed and integrated with a nonlinear class f amplifier. efficiency measurements showed that by employing eer, it is possible to save up to 15% of power losses, comparing to the case when it is supplied by a constant voltage. additionally, adjacent channel power ratio has been measured. the obtained results showed the value higher than 30 db for signals up to 5 mhz of bandwidth, without using a predistortion technique.
signal-flow_graph	two types of numerical errors occur in the implementation of the fast fourier transform (fft): coefficient errors and arithmetic errors. this paper deals with the second type, due to the finite word-length used in all operations. the signal-flow graph of the sub-band dft (sb-dft, or sb-fft as realized in the same efficient structure) consists of two parts: the hadamard part (which contains only additions and subtractions) and the recombination part (which contains also multiplications). the outputs of all these mathematical operations must be scaled. results for the two 's complement fixed-point arithmetic errors of the classical radix-2, ""cooley-tukey type"" (ct-) fft are known from various publications. especially, three radix-2 dit butterflies were defined and studied, which are normally used in most integrated dsp realizations and which differ in the quantizer locations. three corresponding butterfly structures are now defined for the recombination network of the sb-fft; they are analysed theoretically, and error equations are derived from a suitable error model. real input data are assumed in the analysis of arithmetic errors in sb-fft with both rounding and truncation scaling in the hadamard and the recombination parts. monte-carlo simulations are included in the analysis of the arithmetic errors in sb-fft. the results of a thorough evaluation are to be presented, yielding insights into the mechanisms of scaling and multiplier-output quantizations and allowing for a comparison between the sb-fft and ct-fft. for the partial-band versions of the sb-fft, the arithmetic errors are compared with the aliasing components inherent in those approximated versions. both half-band and quarter-band sb-fft are considered in this study. conclusions are drawn for the necessary internal wordlengths of fixed-point realizations.

analog_signal_processing	this letter presents a single-step tunable group delay phaser for spectrum sniffing. this device may be seen as a ""time filter"", where frequencies are suppressed by time separation rather than by spectral attenuation. compared to its multiple-step counterpart, this phaser features higher processing resolution, greater simplicity, lower loss and better channel equalization, due to the smaller and channel-independent group delay swing. a two-channel example is provided for illustration.
pid_controller	the paper focuses on the design of a new automatic landing system (als) in longitudinal plane; the new als controls the aircraft trajectory and longitudinal velocity. aircraft control is achieved by means of a proportional-integral (pi) controller and the instrumental landing system-the first phase of landing (the glide slope) and a proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller together with a radio-altimeter-the second phase of landing (the flare); both controllers modify the reference model associated with aircraft pitch angle. the control of the pitch angle and longitudinal velocity is performed by a neural network adaptive control system, based on the dynamic inversion concept, having the following as components: a linear dynamic compensator, a linear observer, reference models, and a pseudo control hedging (pch) block. the theoretical results are software implemented and validated by complex numerical simulations; compared with other alss having the same radio-technical subsystems but with conventional or fuzzy controllers for the control of aircraft pitch angle and longitudinal velocity, the architecture designed in this paper is characterized by much smaller overshoots and stationary errors.

analog_signal_processing	a methodology for optimum sizing of different components (i.e., rotor diameter, electrical generator rating, and battery capacity) of a standalone wind-battery system is proposed in this paper. on the basis of time series simulation of the system performance along with different design constraints, the entire set of feasible design options, also known as the design space, has been identified on a rotor diameter vs. rated power diagram. the design space of a standalone wind-battery system identifies the entire envelope within which a feasible system may be designed. the optimum configuration of the standalone system is identified on the basis of minimum cost of energy (us$/kwh). it is observed that the cost of energy is sensitive to the magnitude of average demand and the wind regime. sensitivity of the capital cost on the minimum cost of energy is also studied.

state_space_representation	in this paper, we focus on the heavy-tailed stochastic signals generated through continuous-time autoregressive (car) models excited by infinite-variance alpha-stable processes. our goal is to estimate the parameters of the continuous-time model, such as the autoregressive coefficients and the distribution parameters related to the excitation process for the alpha-stable car process with 0 < alpha < 2 based on the state-space representation. likewise, we investigate the closed form expressions for the parameters of equivalent model in the discrete-time setting via regular samples of the process. we analyze the estimator based on the monte carlo simulations and illustrate the estimator consistency to the desired values when sampling frequency and sample size tend to infinity. we also apply the proposed method to the two types of real-world data, financial and ground magnetometer data, to evaluate its performance in real environments.

system_identification	a novel estimator for the identification of continuous-time linear time-varying systems is presented in this paper. the estimator uses kernel-based regression to identify the time-varying coefficients of a linear ordinary differential equation, based on noisy samples of the input and output signals. the estimator adopts a mixed time- and frequency-domain formulation, which allows it to be formulated as the solution of a set of algebraic equations, without relying on finite differences to approximate the time derivatives. since a kernel-based approach is used, the model complexity selection of the time-varying parameters is formulated as an optimisation problem with continuous variables. variance and bias expressions of the estimate are derived and validated on a simulation example. also, it is shown that, in highly noisy environments, the proposed kernel-based estimator provides more reliable results than an oracle'-based estimator which is deprived of regularisation.
microcontroller	precision ultrasonic measurements in binary gas systems provide continuous real-time monitoring of mixture composition and flow. using custom microcontroller-based electronics, we have developed sonar instruments, with numerous potential applications, capable of making continuous high-precision sound velocity measurements. the instrument measures sound transit times along two opposite directions aligned parallel to - or obliquely crossing - the gas flow. the difference between the two measured times yields the gas flow rate while their average gives the sound velocity, which can be compared with sound velocity vs. molar composition look-up curves to obtain the binary mixture at a given temperature and pressure. the look-up curves may be generated from prior measurements in known mixtures of the two components, from theoretical calculations, or from a combination of the two. we describe the instruments and their performance within numerous applications in the atlas experiment at the cern large hadron collider (lhc). the instruments can be of interest in other areas where continuous in-situ binary gas analysis and flowmetry are required.
operational_amplifier	we describe a dc superconducting quantum interference device (squid) readout electronics in flux locked loop (fll) mode without integrator and with only one operational amplifier, which is called single chip readout electronics (scre). a weakly damped niobium-squid magnetometer with a large flux-to-voltage transfer coefficient of about. partial derivative v/partial derivative phi approximate to 380 mu v/phi(0) and scre results in a very simple squid system. we characterize the system and demonstrate its applicability to magnetocardiography (mcg) and measurements using the transient electromagnetic (tem) method. scre not only simplifies the readout scheme, but also improves the system stability, the bandwidth and the slew rate. the difference between scre and a conventional readout scheme (preamplifier + amplifier + integrator) is also discussed.
lorentz_force_law	since the eddy-current problem usually depends on the geometry of the moving conductive sheet and the pole shape, there is no general method for solving it analytically. this paper presents a method for analysis of the eddy current in the special case of a rotating disk in a time-invariant field. the analysis uses coulomb 's law and the method of images to consider the boundary conditions. first, the surface charge generated in the rotating disk is obtained and coulomb 's law is applied to calculate the electric field intensity, assuming an infinite disk radius. second, the finite disk radius is taken into account by introducing an imaginary electric field intensity to satisfy the boundary condition that the radial component of the eddy current is zero at the edge of the rotating disk. third, the braking torque is calculated by applying the lorentz force law. the paper compares the computed braking torque with the experimental results to establish the validity of the model.
system_identification	in many case-control designs of genome-wide association (gwas) or next generation sequencing (ngs) studies, extensive data on secondary traits that may correlate and share the common genetic variants with the primary disease are available. investigating these secondary traits can provide critical insights into the disease etiology or pathology, and enhance the gwas or ngs results. methods based on logistic regression (lg) were developed for this purpose. however, for the identification of rare variants (rvs), certain inadequacies in the lg models and algorithmic instability can cause severely inflated type i error, and significant loss of power, when the two traits are correlated and the rv is associated with the disease, especially at stringent significance levels. to address this issue, we propose a novel set-valued (sv) method that models a binary trait by dichotomization of an underlying continuous variable, and incorporate this into the genetic association model as a critical component. extensive simulations and an analysis of seven secondary traits in a gwas of benign ethnic neutropenia show that the sv method consistently controls type i error well at stringent significance levels, has larger power than the lg-based methods, and is robust in performance to effect pattern of the genetic variant (risk or protective), rare or common variants, rare or common diseases, and trait distributions. because of the sv method 's striking and profound advantage, we strongly recommend the sv method be employed instead of the lg-based methods for secondary traits analyses in case-control sequencing studies.
operational_amplifier	in this paper, a single-stage multi-path operational transconductance amplifier (ota) with fast-settling response for high performance applications is designed. the produced amplifier uses current-shunt technique, double recycling structure, cross-coupled positive feedback configuration and all idle devices in the signal path to enhance transconductance of the conventional folded cascode (fc) amplifier. these transconductance boosting techniques lead to higher dc gain, gain bandwidth (gbw), slew rate and lower settling time compared to the previous fc structures while phase margin is degraded. simulation results are presented using 90nm cmos technology which show 1,800% increment in gbw and a 33.2 db dc gain improvement in the approximately same power consumption compared to the conventional fc amplifier.
electric_motor	the identification of different loss mechanisms and the prediction of exact power dissipations play a significant role in the development of new electric motor designs and the achievement of highest power densities and, therefore, high continuous drive powers. as many approaches exist to estimate the ohmic losses in the windings of a motor and additional mechanical losses, such as bearing losses, the most significant calculation error is usually made in the iron loss estimation of the stator core. in this paper, an analytic calculation method of the iron losses is presented, which gives the opportunity to predict the stator 's losses without time-consuming 3d fem calculations. the basis of the calculation model are commonly known material parameters of the lamination sheet and the insulation varnish, as well as geometric parameters of the target geometry. the result of the loss model is compared and validated with measurement values, delivered by a novel test device for stator segments.
system_identification	the true dynamic characteristics of dams, namely, natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes, are important to earthquake-resistant design. thus, system identification based on in-site measurements is useful for numerical analysis and health monitoring. the well-instrumented strong motion array on an arch dam in southwestern china recorded some seismic response data. the dynamic properties of the dam are identified from records of the top five strongest earthquake motions using power spectral density functions, transfer functions, and the arx model. the identified modal parameters of the different seismic events are compared, and the stability of the stiffness of the dam system from 2002 to 2008 and the nonuniformity in the input ground motion are indicated. a linear finite element model of the dam and a nonlinear model that considers contraction joints are constructed and calibrated to reproduce the frequencies determined from the system identification. the modal analysis highlights potential information about the dynamic characteristics of the dam. the comparison of the results of the system identification and calibration shows that the use of the nonlinear model may be reasonable in simulating the dynamic response of the ertan dam.
state_space_representation	in this paper, we study the deterministic blind identification of multiple channel state-space models having a common unknown input using measured output signals that are perturbed by additive white noise sequences. different from traditional blind identification problems, the considered system is an autoregressive system rather than an fir system; hence, the concerned identification problem is more challenging but possibly having a wider scope of application. two blind identification methods are presented for multi-channel autoregressive systems. a cross-relation identification method is developed by exploiting the mutual references among different channels. it requires at least three channel systems with square and stably invertible transfer matrices. moreover, a general subspace identification method is developed for which two channel systems are sufficient for the blind identification; however, it requires the additive noises to have identical variances and the transfer matrices having no transmission zeros. finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed identification algorithms.

electrical_circuits	this paper deals with a dynamical modelling in view of behavior analysis of double stars induction machine (dsim) supplied by voltage source pwm inverter. two modelling approaches are elaborated. in the first one the stator armatures of the dsim are described by two coupled circuits in concordia 's frame. in the second approach the stator armatures of the dsim are described by two decoupled circuits. one is equivalent to the model of three phase machine in concordia 's frame. and the other is equivalent to a passive circuit and does not produce torque. based on the established electrical circuits, the effect of supply mode and the increasing of the inverter level on the current quality and the torque ripples are analyzed.
electrical_circuits	there is an increasing diversity of educational background of students entering ordinary degree (level 7) and honours degree (level 8) programmes in engineering at dublin institute of technology (dit). partly as a result, student reasoning about basic electricity concepts often differs from accepted explanations. the paper reports, analyses and reflects on the results of a multiple-choice diagnostic test to assess student understanding of such concepts (developed for u.s. high school and college students [1]) taken, as a pre-test, by four cohorts of first year students, on the same dit level 7 engineering programme, from 2008-12 (n=106) and two cohorts of first year students, on the same dit level 8 engineering programme, from 2010-12 (n=64). the performance of the student cohorts is similar, and is little influenced by previous exposure to relevant subjects in second level (high school) education. in the 2012-13 academic year, an updated version of the diagnostic test was taken, in a pilot study, by one cohort of first year students on the dit level 8 engineering programme; this test was administered as a pre-test before instruction, as a post-test immediately after instruction and as a delayed post-test approximately fifteen weeks after instruction. results show that there is little improvement in conceptual understanding of d.c. resistive electric circuits, as measured by the test, when pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test scores are compared.
electrical_circuits	orthogonal connectors are used in drawings of many types of network diagrams, especially those representing electrical circuits. one approach for routing such connectors has been to compute an orthogonal visibility graph formed by intersecting vertical and horizontal lines projected from the corners of all obstacles and then use an a* search over this graph. however the search can be slow since many routes are in some sense topologically equivalent. we introduce obstacle-hugging routes which we conjecture provide a canonical representative for a set of topologically equivalent routes. we also introduce a new 1-bend visibility graph that supports computation of these canonical routes. essentially this contains a node for each obstacle corner and connector endpoint in the diagram and an edge between two nodes iff they can be connected using an orthogonal connector with one bend. we show that the use of a 1-bend visibility graph significantly improves the speed of orthogonal connector routing.
electrical_network	one of the most effective means of minimizing mortalities of large raptors from collisions with hazards is to locate hazards away from major activity centers. a reliable means of delineating bird activity centers on the landscape has been a significant impediment to progress in proactive infrastructure planning. we used brownian bridge movement modeling to develop a population-wide, utilization probability surface for bald eagles (haliaeetus leucocephalus) within the upper chesapeake bay. we used locations (n=320,304) for individuals (n=63) tracked with global positioning system (gps) satellite transmitters between 2007 and 2011 in the analysis. we intersected the electrical network on the probability surface within aberdeen proving ground, a 350-km(2) military installation to identify overlap between power lines and eagle activity centers. we also overlaid locations of eagle mortalities attributed to the lines (n=67) on the installation to assess the relationship between mortality rates and utilization probabilities. areas of high bald eagle use were relatively rare on the landscape with only 0.1% and 5% of the area accounting for 10% and 30% of estimated utilization. most electric lines were along roads and distributed away from eagle activity centers, with only 0.3% of lines located within areas with the highest estimated eagle use. eagle mortalities were highly skewed to lines that overlapped with eagle activity centers. eagle mortality rates (birds/100km/yr) were 42 times higher along lines associated with the highest 10% of eagle use compared to lines associated with the lowest 10% use, suggesting that estimated utilization may be an effective proxy for mortality risk associated with electric line hazards. the majority (71.9%) of high-use bald eagle areas delineated within the study area have no existing electric lines. utilization probabilities may be a potential tool for site-specific infrastructure planning.

electricity	bioremediation plays an important role in oil spill management and bio-electrochemical treatment systems are supposed to represent a new technology for both effective remediation and energy recovery. diesel removal rate increased by four times in microbial fuel cells (mfcs) since the electrode served as an electron acceptor, and high power density (29.05 w m(-3)) at current density 72.38 a m(-3) was achieved using diesel (v/v 1%) as the sole substrate. as revealed by scanning electron microscope images, carbon fibres in the anode electrode were covered with biofilm and the bacterial colloids which build the link between carbon fibres and enhance electron transmission. trace metabolites produced during the anaerobic biodegradation were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. these metabolites may act as emulsifying agents that benefit oil dispersion and play a vital role in bioremediation of oil spills in field applications.

electrical_circuits	functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify the brain-based mechanisms of uncertainty and certainty associated with answers to multiple-choice questions involving common misconceptions about electric circuits. twenty-two scientifically novice participants (humanities and arts college students) were asked, in an fmr1 study, whether or not they thought the light bulbs in images presenting electric circuits were lighted up correctly, and if they were certain or uncertain of their answers. when participants reported that they were unsure of their responses, analyses revealed significant activations in brain areas typically involved in uncertainty (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula cortex, and superior/dorsomedial frontal cortex) and in the left middle/superior temporal lobe. certainty was associated with large bilateral activations in the occipital and parietal regions usually involved in visuospatial processing. correct-and-certain answers were associated with activations that suggest a stronger mobilization of visual attention resources when compared to incorrect-and-certain answers. these findings provide insights into brainbased mechanisms of uncertainty that are activated when common misconceptions, identified as such by science education research literature, interfere in decision making in a school-like task. we also discuss the implications of these results from an educational perspective.

electric_motor	in previous studies on precise computation methods of iron loss, it has been shown that the 1-d dynamic magnetic field analysis with hysteresis in post-processing is effective. however, there is a problem in that the hysteresis makes the convergence of nonlinear iterations unstable. this paper proposes a stabilization method for the 1-d dynamic magnetic field analysis with hysteresis. the proposed method is characterized as an approach for improving the initial value and the step size in the newton-raphson method. the results of this paper showed that the convergence characteristic of the nonlinear 1-d magnetic field analysis for variety flux density waveforms of each part in an electric motor is improved using the proposed method.
system_identification	in this article a method for the measurement of the linear frequency response of weakly non-linear systems is described. a frequency domain estimator is developed by analyzing the output spectra for single- and multitone excitations of several types of system models with the most complex system one being a parallel-cascade wiener-hammerstein-type model which is able to represent a wide range of weakly non-linear systems. it is then shown that the output spectrum of such a weakly non-linear system can be expressed by a polynomial with constant coefficients for a given input signal at each frequency. this leads to the proposed polynomial estimator h-p that is capable of identifying the true linear, nonparametric frequency response of the system under test. special versions for either input or output noise only are developed and consistency is shown for all considered system models.
electrical_network	distributed ac power systems using inverters connected in parallel are becoming increasingly widespread with the development of autonomous microgrids. inverters can be controlled to emulate the dynamics of nonlinear oscillators, such that multiple inverters coupled through an electrical network will synchronize and share load in proportion to their ratings. in this paper, a communication-less control method is developed for islanded parallel inverters based on the van der pol oscillator and a virtual impedance technique. the controller can be tuned to guarantee fast synchronization of inverters, as well as optimal load power sharing, regardless of differences in the physical parameters of the inverters and their respective filters. a methodology for parameter selection is presented to tune the controller so that the system voltage amplitude remains within prescribed bounds whilst ensuring optimal load sharing and minimizing synchronization time. simulation results demonstrate the performances which can be obtained with several parallel-connected inverters using this control method with correctly tuned parameters.
pid_controller	vibration is a physical phenomenon involving repeated oscillatory movements or fluctuations at certain frequency and typically undesirable in many applications since it may cause undue failure or damage to the system. in this paper, the vibration of a three degree-of-freedom (dof) model representing a short length drive shaft has been effectively and robustly suppressed through the implementation of a novel active force control (afc) used in conjunction with a classic proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller. the shaft vibration caused by its support and constraint during its operation was simulated using matlab and simulink considering a number of operating and loading conditions. the results proved that when a pure pid controller was implemented, the vibration is indeed reduced but at the expense of longer execution time and producing noticeable frequency oscillation with slight offset. on the other hand, when the afc loop was engaged by adding it directly in series with the pid controller (pid+afc) to produce a 2 dof controller without any need to further tune the pid controller gains, the vibration is significantly reduced with the amplitude hovering a zero datum without any offset and yielding an extremely low frequency trending.

pid_controller	open-loop unstable systems with time-delays are often encountered in process industry, which are often more difficult to control than stable processes. in this paper, the stabilization by pid controller of second order unstable processes, which can be represented as second-order deadtime with an unstable pole (sodup) and second-order deadtime with two unstable poles (sodtup), is performed via the necessary and sufficient criteria of routh-hurwitz stability analysis. the stability analysis provides improved understanding on the existence of a stabilizing range of each pid parameter. three simple pid tuning algorithms are proposed to provide desired closed-loop performance-robustness within the stable regions of controller parameters obtained via the stability analysis. the proposed pid controllers show improved performance over those derived via some existing methods.

control_engineering	since industrial processes have a wide range of operating conditions, it is difficult to build a single global model that describes a process. one solution that is widely used in control engineering practice is to combine multiple models based on collected process data. for this approach to be successful, it is important to cluster the data before the modeling. in this study, pairwise constraints and an active-learning method were incorporated into the affinity propagation algorithm, resulting in a new method called active semi-supervised affinity propagation (assap) clustering. to apply assap to the modeling of industrial processes, an active-learning strategy is firstly used to obtain constraints on data based on the angle of change between two data points and the probability of their belonging to the same class, and then the constraints are used to adjust the clustering process so as to improve the clustering precision. finally, the least-squares-support-vector-machine (ls-svm) is used to build a submodel for each cluster of data points, and then all the sub-models are integrated into a model for the whole data set. verification of the assap method was carried out on data from the uci (university of california, irvine) machine learning repository and olivetti dataset. in addition, assap and ls-svm are combined to be applied to the data of the combustion process of a coke oven. the result shows the effectiveness of the method of modeling of complex industrial process based on assap.

operational_amplifier	electrochemical biosensing is used to detect specific analytes in fluids, such as bacterial and chemical contaminants. a common implementation of an electrochemical readout is a potentiostat, which usually includes potentiometric, amperometric, and impedimetric detection. recently several researchers have developed small, low-cost, single-chip silicon-based potentiostats. with the advances in heterogeneous integration technology, low-power potentiostats can be implemented on paper and similar low cost substrates. this paper deals with the design of a low-power paper-based amperometric front-end for a low-cost and rapid detection environment. in amperometric detection a voltage signal is provided to a sensor system, while a small current value generated by an electrochemical redox reaction in the system is measured. in order to measure low current values, the noise of the circuit must be minimized, which is accomplished with a pre-amplification front-end stage, typically designed around an operational amplifier core. an appropriate circuit design for a low-power and low-cost amperometric front-end is identified, taking the heterogeneous integration of various components into account. the operational amplifier core is on a bare custom cmos chip, which will be integrated onto the paper substrate alongside commercial off-the-shelf electronic components. a general-purpose low-power two-stage cmos amplifier circuit is designed and simulated for the ams 350 nm 5 v process. after the layout design and verification, the ic was submitted for a multi-project wafer manufacturing run. the simulated results are a bandwidth of 2.4 mhz, a common-mode rejection ratio of 70.04 db, and power dissipation of 0.154 mw, which are comparable with the analytical values.
electrical_circuits	due to the rapid development of renewable energy and waste energy recovery, absorption energy storage is an important technology with promising future. however, because most researches focus on working fluid flow rather than energy flow used in electric power systems, it is hard to analyze the entire systems as a whole. this contribution introduces the electrical circuit analogy to analyze absorption energy storage systems from the perspective of energy flow. it turns the energy storage and release processes to their corresponding electrical circuits, which are described by kirchhoff 's laws in circuitous philosophy instead of complex component analysis. on this basis, optimization of an absorption energy storage system is converted to a conditional extremum problem, and applying the lagrange multiplier method offers the optimization equations to directly obtain the optimal structural and operating parameters with the best performance. in this contribution, the optimized results offer 13% and 25% higher power in the storage and release cases, respectively, compared to existing experimental results. besides, inspired from the batteries connected in parallel and series, the design of a multi-stage absorption energy storage system could store low-grade heat but provide high-grade heat, which further reveals the superior of the newly proposed approach.

electrical_network	the issue of testability, intended as a measure of solvability of the parametric fault diagnosis problem in analog linear time-invariant electrical networks, is addressed in this paper. independently of the considered fault location method, such important metric provides information as to how many and which components can be diagnosed. for the reader 's convenience and to set up an appropriate framework for our main achievements, our first concern is to rederive fundamental results concerning analog linear time-invariant electrical network testability hinging on multifrequency measurements. then a novel algorithm for testability analysis is proposed, which is straightforward and able to circumvent the main drawbacks of formerly proposed methods, such as computational and conceptual complexities, proneness to roundoff errors, and vulnerability to particular cases. a computer program that implements such algorithm is also described. moreover, the possibility of employing further simplified versions of the latter and their links with a previously proposed approach are discussed on rigorous bases. finally, examples are provided, which show the effectiveness and robustness of the new algorithms, also by means of a comparison with the old ones. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.

electrical_circuits	since thermal environment affects production, egg quality and laying hens' mortality rates, it is highly relevant to control the thermal environment within poultry houses so that the best financial profits could be obtained. three commercial poultry houses with different climatization systems are analyzed in current research: a poultry house with tunnel-like ventilation and pad cooling; a poultry house with natural ventilation and nebulization; a poultry house with simple natural ventilation. their thermal environment, production, egg quality and laying hens' mortality rates among different poultry houses and at different areas of the same poultry house are compared. economic profits based on difference in electric energy consumption by climatization systems and on the laying hens' productivity of each poultry house are calculated. electricity meters were installed within the electrical circuits of the climatization and light systems of the three poultry houses. data were registered between december 2011 and march 2012 and results showed that all the poultry houses featured heterogeneity in internal thermal environment with faults in the climatization systems. important differences were reported in egg production and quality caused by overheating. the poultry house with tunnel-like ventilation and pad cooling had the best thermal isolation from the external environment that resulted in a 12.04% improvement in production, decrease between 30 and 40% in laying hens' mortality rates and the best economic result.

state_space_representation	in this study, a new state space representation of the protein folding problem for the use of reinforcement learning methods is proposed. in the existing studies, the way of defining the state-action space prevents the agent to learn the state space for any amino-acid sequence, but rather, the defined state-action space is valid for only a particular amino-acid sequence. moreover, in the existing methods, the size of the state space is strictly depends on the amino-acid sequence length. the newly proposed state-action space reduces this dependency and allows the agent to find the optimal fold of any sequence of a certain length. additionally, by utilizing an ant based reinforcement learning algorithm, the ant-q algorithm, optimum fold of a protein is found rapidly when compared to the standard q-learning algorithm. experiments showed that, the new state-action space with the ant based reinforcement learning method is much more suited for the protein folding problem in two dimensional lattice model.

electricity	this study aims to conduct the nonlinearity analysis of the shading effect on the technical-economic performance of the building-integrated photovoltaic blind (bipb), which is designed as a preliminary study to evaluate the feasibility of the bipb before its implementation. first, in terms of the technical performance of the bipb, the shading effect due to the blind 's slat in the bipb can have a nonlinear effect on the amount of electricity generation per unit area (aegunit) from the bipb. particularly, as the width of the pv panel increases, the aeg(unit) from the bipb tends to decrease. second, in terms of the economic performance of the bipb, the feasibility of the bipb depends on the type of investment values. specifically, as' the width of the pv panel increases, the npv25 (net present value at year 25) tends to increase; however, the sir25 (saving-to-investment ratio at year 25) tends to decrease. that is, while the npv25 is determined to be highest at us$82,869 when the width of the pv panel is 50 mm, the sir25 is determined to be highest at 2.90 times when the width of the pv panel is 10 mm. the main findings of this study can be used to clearly define the design specifications of the bipb before its implementation, which ensure to meet the client expectations on various objectives, such as technical performance (e.g., the aeg(unit) from the bipb) and economic performance (e.g., npv25 and sir25).

electrical_network	microgrid is a low voltage electrical network with distributed generations, energy storage devices and controllable loads. this paper utilizes artificial neural network (ann) to predict the optimum voltages in order to extract the maximum power and increment the efficiency of photovoltaic system. in this regard, the optimum voltages are achieved by the genetic algorithm (ga). then these optimum values are used in ann method. the results of ann-ga is compared with the other methods that verified the proposed method with high accuracy which can track the maximum power point (mpp) under different insolation and temperature circumstances and also, meet the load demand with less fluctuation around the mpp.; also it can increase the convergence speed to achieve the mpp. as well as, the evaluation of fuzzy logic controller (flc) in comparison with the pi controller in pitch angle of wind turbine (wt) is carried out. in order to control the output power of wind turbine, by implementing the wind speed and active power as inputs of flc, it has faster responses, smoother power curves, less oscillation than aforementioned methods which lead to improve the dynamic responses of wt. the models are developed and applied in the matlab/simulink program.
electricity	by proposing a three-hierarchy meta-frontier data envelopment analysis (dea), this paper first decomposes co2-emissions efficiency and the potential for emissions reduction into the following three components: structural, technical, and management. based on these components, we then conduct an empirical analysis of china 's total-factor co2-emissions efficiency, its potential for co2-emissions reduction, and its corresponding implementation path. the results show that co2-emissions efficiency in mainland china is relatively low because of structural inefficiency, technical inefficiency, and management inefficiency. the chinese government is expected to realize a large quantity of co2-emissions reduction potential (nearly 40% of the current total co2-emissions) through adjusting the industrial structure, narrowing the technology gap among regions, promoting the reform of marketization, and strengthening environmental regulation. the causes of co2-emissions inefficiency and the distribution of potential reductions in emissions show a distinct spatial difference characteristic. therefore, this paper also formulates emissions-reduction strategies for china 's 30 provinces according to their specific situations, noting the direction of the industrial structure adjustment and the path to improving co2-emissions efficiency.
pid_controller	the robust and precise control of piezoelectric stages is quite challenging due to the existence of strong hysteresis nonlinearity. in this paper, the dynamics of a piezoelectric stage is identified as a second-order linear system preceded by an input hysteresis characterized by the prandtl-ishlinskii (pi) model. then, a control strategy based on the uncertainty and disturbance estimator (ude) is developed to mitigate the effect of hysteresis nonlinearity and improve the performance of the positioning control of the piezoelectric stage, without the detailed model of the hysteresis except the slope information of the pi hysteresis asymptotes. moreover, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system with the ude-based controller is provided. extensive experimental studies are carried out on a physik instrumente p-753.31c piezoelectric stage to demonstrate that the ude-based controller can achieve excellent performance in trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection, compared to the proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller and a disturbance-observer-based controller.
electricity	the jiuquan satellite launch center (jslc) is a relatively isolated special zone in the northwest region of china. the potential risk to the energy supply security and the pressure of national greenhouse gas emissions reduction clearly indicates the jslc 's need to lower its dependency on imported fossil fuels and electricity. this article presents a feasibility analysis on the available hybrid energy system based on the renewable energy availability and local electricity demand estimation in 2020 through homer model. the simulation results indicate that cost of energy (coe) of the three proposed options are 0.127, 0.033 and 0.123 $/kwh, respectively. it also shows that the proposed hybrid renewable energy systems can reduce carbon emissions by 40-70% compared to electricity from the existing power grid. a sensitivity analysis reveals that the coe has a significant positive relationship with carbon price and discount rate, whereas carbon price shows a significantly distinct impact on the coe for different options considered. the optimization results also show that a grid-connected renewable power system comprised of wind power and natural gas power plant is the most economic and environment-friendly energy supply option for jslc. however, a hybrid re system with a local energy storage facility can better guarantee the energy supply safety considering the special function and security needs of the jslc. this study verified that constructing new coal fired power plants is not a suitable choice from both the cost effectiveness and kenvironmental protection perspectives.

analog_signal_processing	we present a loss-gain equalized reconfigurable c-section analog signal processor (asp) for dynamic radio analog signal processing (r-asp). such an asp provides real-time tunable group delay response with all-pass transmission. we propose a lumped loss-gain implementation, where tuning and equalization are mostly easily achieved. a theoretical study derives the transfer function and the fundamental characteristics of the device. the asp is finally experimentally demonstrated, first using a single loss-gain pair and finally a three cascaded loss-gain pair structure with full reconfigurability, where up-chirp and down-chirp group delays are shown for illustration. it is expected that this asp will find wide applications in r-asp systems requiring dynamic adaptability.
control_engineering	soft computing, as opposed to traditional computing, deals with approximate models and gives solutions to complex real-life problems. unlike hard computing, soft computing is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximations. in effect, the role model for soft computing is the human mind. soft computing is based on techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, machine learning, and expert systems. although soft computing theory and techniques were first introduced in 1980s, it has now become a major research and study area in automatic control engineering. the techniques of soft computing are nowadays being used successfully in many domestic, commercial, and industrial applications. with the advent of the low-cost and very high performance digital processors and the reduction of the cost of memory chips it is clear that the techniques and application areas of soft computing will continue to expand. this paper gives an overview of the current state of soft computing techniques and describes the advantages and disadvantages of soft computing compared to traditional hard computing techniques.

state_space_representation	we consider the parametric estimation of the driving levy process of a multivariate continuous-time autoregressive moving average (mcarma) process, which is observed on the discrete time grid (0, h, 2h, ... ). beginning with a new state space representation, we develop a method to recover the driving levy process exactly from a continuous record of the observed mcarma process. we use tools from numerical analysis and the theory of infinitely divisible distributions to extend this result to allow for the approximate recovery of unit increments of the driving levy process from discrete-time observations of the mcarma process. we show that, if the sampling interval h = h(n) is chosen dependent on n, the length of the observation horizon, such that nh(n) converges to zero as n tends to infinity, then any suitable generalized method of moments estimator based on this reconstructed sample of unit increments has the same asymptotic distribution as the one based on the true increments, and is, in particular, asymptotically normally distributed.

analog_signal_processing	continuous valued number system is a novel number system which can be employed for developing analog signal processing units. it is a continuous number system which is represented by a set of continuous digits. one of the main features of this system is that digits share information, and have a digit-level redundancy. this redundancy is used to protect the digits against environment imperfections when implemented by analog circuits. in this paper, integrity of this number system in representing real values is explored. the study is required to show the effect of implementation imperfections which is an indicative of its feasibility. effects of possible errors and error threshold for implementing this system are studied in this paper. an error recovery method is proposed, which enhances this number system representation. an efficient error recovery method extends the application of this number system in high density memory and storage devices for hardware implementations of neural networks.
system_identification	for a dual-rate sampled hammerstein controlled autoregressive moving average (carma) system, this paper uses the polynomial transformation technology to obtain its dual-rate bilinear identification model which is suitable for the available dual-rate sampled-data, uses the maximum likelihood principle to construct a unified parameter vector of all parameters and an information vector formed by the derivative of the noise variable to the unified parameter vector, and directly identifies the parameters of the linear block and the nonlinear block for the dual-rate hammerstein carma system. the unified parameter vector contains the minimum number of the unknown parameters, and the proposed maximum likelihood estimation algorithm has higher computational efficiency than the over-parameterization model based least squares algorithm.
electrical_circuits	printed carbon graphite materials are the primary common component in the majority of screen printed sensors. screen printing allows a scalable manufacturing solution, accelerating the means by which novel sensing materials can make the transition from laboratory material to commercial product. a common bottleneck in any thick film printing process is the controlled drying of the carbon paste material. a study has been undertaken which examines the interaction between material solvent, printed film conductivity and process consistency. the study illustrates that it is possible to reduce the solvent boiling point to significantly increase process productivity while maintaining process consistency. the lower boiling point solvent also has a beneficial effect on the conductivity of the film, reducing the sheet resistance. it is proposed that this is a result of greater film stressing increasing charge percolation through greater inter particle contact. simulations of material performance and drying illustrate that a multi layered printing provides a more time efficient manufacturing method. the findings have implications for the volume manufacturing of the carbon sensor electrodes but also have implications for other applications where conductive carbon is used, such as electrical circuits and photovoltaic devices.
analog_signal_processing	a pelton-wheel impulse turbine is a hydro mechanical energy conversion device which converts gravitational energy of elevated water into mechanical work. this mechanical work is converted into electrical energy by means of running an electrical generator the kinetic energy of the water-jet is directed tangentially at the buckets of a pelton-wheel. the water-jet strikes on each bucket 's convex profile splitter and get split into two halves. each half is turned backwards, almost through 180 degrees relative to the bucket on a horizontal plane. practically this angle may vary between 165 degrees to 170 degrees. normally all the jet energy is used in propelling the rim of the bucket wheel. invariably some jet water misses the bucket and posses onto the tail race without doing any useful work. this hydro, device is a good source of hydro-electrical energy conversion for a high water head. the present work in this research paper deals with some advanced modifications in the conventional pelton-wheel so that it can be used for low-head and heavy-discharge applications. both kinetic and potential energy of the water source is consumed by the runner wheel. considerable gravitational effect of the water jet is exploited by means of some modifications in a conventional pelton-wheel. a comparatively heavy generator can be run by this modified pelton-wheel turbine under low-head and heavy-discharge conditions. the modified features provide enough promising opportunities to use this turbine for mini and micro hydro power plants.
microcontroller	this paper proposes an innovative method for power consumption measurement in microcontroller-based systems that provides high accuracy on a wide dynamic range of current values, which makes it particularly suitable for all those applications characterized by alternating low-/high-power modes and fast current variations. we demonstrate that using an op-amp-based voltage feedback configuration, it is possible to use shunt resistor values higher than usual to obtain increased voltage drops without affecting the microcontroller 's power supply voltage. consequently, it is possible to directly use a data acquisition board to acquire the shunt voltage, eliminating all those common errors, like offset and gain, due to the use of an additional intermediate amplification stage. the proposed scheme has been successfully used to accurately characterize the power consumption of a single sensor node of a wireless sensor network.
digital_control	a digital dead-beat current controller for voltage source converters is presented in this paper. the control structure is specified in a digital hardware description language, synthesized, and deployed on a field-programmable gate array chip. by updating, with negligible computation delay, the duty cycle twice in a switching period, the reference current error is nulled in half a modulation period, so that the controller 's small-signal bandwidth is maximized. in addition, due to a simple transient detection circuit, the large-signal response delay is reduced to a small fraction of the modulation period, which is determined by the chosen current signal oversampling rate. the controller can effectively support different voltage-source inverter applications, such as active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource controllers, and dc-dc converter applications, including interface converters for renewable energy sources, laboratory battery chargers, and electronic welding machines.

electrical_circuits	in this paper, the application of cots (commercial of-the-shelf) tegs (thermoelectric generator) of bi2te3 type for power supply of autonomous sensors has been investigated. architecture of a teg system has been established and the expected electrical power provision has been simulated and tested with agreement better than one order of magnitude between simulation and test. during the mission the heat flow of the teg may reverse, therefore this has to be taken into account in the design of the corresponding electrical circuits. teg sensitivity to low temperatures (below 0 degrees c) has been found and addressed via selection of different cots teg types which were tested without any problems down to -10 degrees c. a concept for central provision of electrical power with tegs has been discussed shortly that showed the need for new high temperature tegs which can operate on temperatures above 700 degrees c.

system_identification	the authors have previously shown that many traditional approaches to operational modal analysis (oma) struggle to properly identify the modal damping ratios for bridges under traffic loading due to the interference caused by the driving frequencies of the traffic loads. this paper presents a novel methodology for modal parameter estimation in oma that overcomes the problems presented by driving frequencies and significantly improves the damping estimates. this methodology is based on finding the power spectral density (psd) of a given modal coordinate, and then dividing the modal psd into separate regions, left- and right-side spectra. the modal coordinates were found using a blind source separation (bss) algorithm and a curve-fitting technique was developed that uses optimization to find the modal parameters that best fit each side spectra of the psd. specifically, a pattern-search optimization method was combined with a clustering analysis algorithm and together they were employed in a series of stages in order to improve the estimates of the modal damping ratios. this method was used to estimate the damping ratios from a simulated bridge model subjected to moving traffic loads. the results of this method were compared to other established oma methods, such as frequency domain decomposition (fdd) and bss methods, and they were found to be more accurate and more reliable, even for modes that had their psds distorted or altered by driving frequencies.

operational_amplifier	in order to obtain very precise measurements of the position of agents located at a considerable distance using a sensor system based on position sensitive detectors (psd), it is necessary to analyze and mitigate the factors that generate substantial errors in the system 's response. these sources of error can be divided into electronic and geometric factors. the former stem from the nature and construction of the psd as well as the performance, tolerances and electronic response of the system, while the latter are related to the sensor 's optical system. here, we focus solely on the electrical effects, since the study, analysis and correction of these are a prerequisite for subsequently addressing geometric errors. a simple calibration method is proposed, which considers psd response, component tolerances, temperature variations, signal frequency used, signal to noise ratio (snr), suboptimal operational amplifier parameters, and analog to digital converter (adc) quantitation snrq, etc. following an analysis of these effects and calibration of the sensor, it was possible to correct the errors, thus rendering the effects negligible, as reported in the results section.
state_space_representation	we analyzed some singular distributed parameter system(sdps) with boundary conditions in high dimension bounded domain with sufficiently smooth boundary. with the spectrum theory in pde, the systems initially is formulated as an infinite-dimensional singular systems. the state space representation of the system is built according to matrices decomposition method. and the admissible property is discussed. by the singular system theory some novel uniform state feedback controller is designed.
electric_motor	a large set of decimetric and microwave observations of solar millisecond radio spikes is compared and correlated with simultaneous hard x-ray observations in the 25-438 kev range, recorded by the hard x-ray burst spectrometer (hxrbs) on board the solar maximum mission satellite. radio spikes have time scales of 20-200 ms, while hard x-ray bursts rarely show fine structures shorter than 1 s. the main conclusions of a statistical analysis of a) the association rate, b) the correlation degree, and c) relative time delays between hard x-ray and radio spike emissions, are: 1) radio spike bursts reveal the highest hard x-ray association rate of any kind of coherent solar radio emission; approximately 95% of the observed events occur during (mostly impulsive) hard x-ray bursts. conversely, almost-equal-to 2% of all hxrbs flares produce radio millisecond spike bursts. 2) spike bursts are preferentially associated with the impulsive phase of the hard x-ray event; about half of all observations are closely associated with the main peak of a simultaneous x-ray event. 3) we find a significant temporal correlation between spike clusters and hard x-ray events. about 43% of the compared events show hard x-ray time profiles that mimic the concentration of simultaneous radio spikes. this also holds for small fluctuations with time scales of the order of a few seconds. 4) the durations of spike events and associated hard x-ray bursts closely correlate, the x-ray bursts being somewhat longer than the radio events. 5) the radio emission is usually delayed in respect to hard x-ray bursts, typically a few seconds. the relative delays seem to be restricted to the following rules: the radio event usually starts before the peak time of the hard x-ray event (73 out of 84 cases), and similarly, the x-ray burst almost always starts before the maximum of spike burst activity (83 out of 84 cases). this is shown to hold for a wide range of burst durations. we have not found any convincing relation concerning the relative time differences of the end times, however. 6) the observed delays of the order of several seconds put some constraints on the acceleration and propagation of particles. the delays are found to be incompatible with the build-up time of a loss-cone distribution (for maser emission) by an order of magnitude, if the, same population of electrons is responsible for radio and x-ray radiation. rather, considering the smallness of the radio spike sources, the proportionality of the x-ray flux with the spike rate, and the spatial 'spread of a propagating electron population, it is argued that both the time delays and the quantization into discrete radio events are caused by the operation of the accelerator.
electric_motor	this is the second of a two-part study that discusses multimode combustion in a mild hybrid electric vehicle. homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) combustion oxidizes the oxygen storage capacity (osc) of the three-way catalyst (twc), thereby removing the twc 's ability to convert nox under lean conditions. despite prolonged operation in hcci mode, enabled by the electric motor, the depletion of the osc causes significant penalties in fuel economy and the amounts of tailpipe nox are substantial. counter-intuitively, it is seen that decreasing the sizes of both hcci regime and osc results in reduced tailpipe nox while maintaining fuel economy benefits.
microcontroller	this work describes the design of two devices for measuring the blood volume changes, in the forearm with a portable device and in the thighs through clothes in seated position. when blood volume arrives to the measurement site from the left ventricle, the electrical properties of the body segment change. these changes, that mainly comprise the electrical impedance of the tissue, are measured through the injection of a safely ac current and the detection of the voltage changes due to blood flow. the signal recorded with such a method is the impedance plethysmogram (ipg). for the portable device, an analog processing converts the ipg waveform to square pulses and a microcontroller performs the on-line estimation of the heart rate. accuracy of the results accomplishes the standards of the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation for heart rate monitors. when measuring the ipg in the thighs through clothes, on the other hand, the main inconvenient are the stray capacitances that modify the waveform of the measured signal. however, with the proper cares, the waveform is good enough to extract the heart rate in the post processing.
electricity	we study the energy dispatch of power distribution networks (pdns) coupled with urban transportation networks. the electricity demand at each charging/swapping facility is influenced by the arrival rates and charging requests of electric vehicles, which further depends on the spatial distribution of traffic flows over the entire transportation system. we consider the impact of the road congestion on route choices of vehicles from a system-level perspective. the traffic flow pattern in steady state is characterized by the wardrop user equilibrium. we consider the pdn load perturbation caused by the traffic demand uncertainty, and propose a robust dispatch method that maintains the feasibility of an alternating current power flow constraints. by applying the convex relaxation to nonlinear branch power flow equations, the proposed model yields a two-stage robust convex optimization problem with an implicit uncertainty set. moreover, a decomposition framework is proposed, in which the first phase determines the uncertainty set of electricity demand by solving two traffic assignment problems associated with the extreme scenarios, and the second phase solves a two-stage robust second-order cone program following a delayed constraint generation framework. several issues regarding the scalability and conservatism are elaborated. case studies corroborate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method.
electrical_circuits	building physical computing projects can enable learners to integrate computing into a range of interests and disciplines. however, the electronic portion of these projects can be difficult. students are learning new concepts as well as how to work with new tools. this influx of information can be difficult for students to retain in their working memory as they construct their circuits. in this paper, we introduce bitblox, a set of modular, solderless breadboards for prototyping circuits. bitblox attempts to decrease the cognitive load on the user by reducing the complexity found in the standard breadboard by bringing visibility to the underlying connections within its modules. we present a comparative classroom study integrating the breadboard and bitblox into two different high school classes. our qualitative analysis focuses on student errors, strategies, and collaborative practices, highlighting important dynamics for designing hardware tools.
microcontroller	this paper presents a new single-phase asymmetrical cascaded multilevel dc-link inverter. the proposed inverter comprises two stages. the main stage of the inverter consists of multiple similar cells, each of which is a half-bridge inverter consisting of two switches and a single dc source. all cells are connected in a cascaded manner with a fixed neutral point. the dc source values are not made equal to increase the performance of the inverter. the second circuit is a folded cascaded h-bridge circuit operating at a line frequency. one of the main advantages of this proposed topology is that it is a modular type and can thus be extended to high stages without changing the configuration of the main stage circuit. two control schemes, namely, low switching with selective harmonic elimination and sinusoidal pulse width modulation, are employed to validate the proposed topology. the detailed approach of each control scheme and switching pulses are discussed in detail. a 150w prototype of the proposed system is implemented in the laboratory to verify the validity of the proposed topology.
pid_controller	this paper presents a flower pollination algorithm (fpa) tuned fuzzy logic controlled (flc) synchronous buck converter (sbc) for an integrated wave/ supercapacitor (sc) hybrid energy system. in order to compensate the irregular wave effects on electrical side of the wave energy converter (wec), a sc unit charged by solar panels is connected in parallel to the wec system and a sbc is controlled to provide more reliable and stable voltage to the dc load. in order to test the performance of the designed flc, a classical proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller is also employed. both of the controllers are optimized by fpa which is a pretty new optimization algorithm and a well-known optimization algorithm of which particle swarm optimization (pso) to minimize the integral of time weighted absolute error (itae) performance index. also, the other error-based objective functions are considered. the entire energy system and controllers are developed in matlab/simulink and realized experimentally. real time applications are done through ds1104 controller board. the simulation and experimental results show that fpa tuned fuzzy logic controller provides lower value performance indices than conventional pid controller by reducing output voltage sags and swells of the wave/sc energy system. index terms-fuzzy

electric_motor	this paper presents a design method of flux-switching permanent magnet machine to reduce acoustic noise and mechanical vibration. a main source of noise and vibration in electric motor is radial magnetic force. mechanical vibrations are generated by electromagnetic interference between harmonic components of radial magnetic force and mechanical resonance frequencies of structures of the motor. then, the motor design has to be considered to reduce the amplitude of radial magnetic force harmonic. the radial magnetic force is calculated by finite element method and maxwell stress tensor. the harmonic components of radial magnetic force are examined by fourier decomposition.
electric_motor	this paper presents a new design of an electronic fixed calliper-based wedge brake system. the movement of both sides of the brake piston is activated by a wedge block mechanism. the proposed fixed calliper-based electronic wedge brake system is a class of hydraulic-free device. the mechanism consists of two sets of wedge blocks, a ball screw drive shaft, a sliding beam and an electric motor. in this mechanism, the rotation of the shaft of the electric motor is converted into linear motion by using a ball screw drive shaft while the linear motion of the drive shaft will force the sliding beam to be displaced linearly. this will activate the wedge mechanism, which will cause the pad to be displaced tangentially to the disc brake. the movement of the pad in pressing the disc will generate clamping force and produce brake torque when the wheel rotates. in this study, the mathematical model of the system that generates the clamping force was identified. the model was based on a second order transfer function. the proposed mathematical model was then validated experimentally using a brake test rig installed with several sensors and input-output (10) device. the performance of the brake mechanism in term of rotational input of the drive shaft and clamping force produced by the brake were observed. accordingly, a torque tracking proportional-integral-derivative (pid) control of the system was proposed and studied through simulation and experiment. comparisons between experimental results and model responses were made. it is found that the trend between simulation results and experimental data are similar, with an acceptable level of error.

electricity	large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources (res) plays a central role in reducing co2 emissions from energy supply systems, but intermittency from solar and wind technologies presents integration challenges. high temperature co-electrolysis of steam and co2 in power-to-gas (ptg) and power-to-liquid (ptl) configurations could utilize excess intermittent electricity by converting it into chemical fuels. these can then be directly consumed in other sectors, such as transportation and heating, or used as power storage. here, we investigate the impact of carbon policy and fossil fuel prices on the economic and engineering potential of ptg and ptl systems as storage for intermittent renewable electricity and as a source of low-carbon heating and transportation energy in the alpine region. we employ a spatially and temporally explicit optimization approach of res, ptg, ptl and fossil technologies in the electricity, heating, and transportation sectors, using the bewhere model. results indicate that large-scale deployment of ptg and ptl technologies for producing chemical fuels from excess intermittent electricity is feasible, particularly when incentivized by carbon prices. depending on carbon and fossil fuel price, 0.15-15 million tonnes/year of captured co2 can be used in the synthesis of the chemical fuels, displacing up to 11% of current fossil fuel use in transportation. by providing a physical link between the electricity, transportation, and heating sectors, ptg and ptl technologies can enable greater integration of res into the energy supply chain globally.

electric_motor	in the last decades, wearable powered orthoses have been introduced in the state of the art for lower-limb rehabilitation. most of these applications are driven by electric motors. comparing with electric motor actuators, pneumatic artificial muscle (pam) actuators are compliant because of the elasticity of pams. consequently, for more safety and comfort of lower-limb rehabilitation, a compliant robotic orthosis powered by pams is developed. based on safe control, a new control method, proxy-based sliding mode control (psmc), was introduced into rehabilitation robotics a few years ago. it combined safety and accuracy of tracking to make it suitable for the safe control of pam actuators. as the reason of low frequency response of pam actuators and variable loads caused by different human subjects, the fixed parameters of psmc makes the tracking performance vary from subject to subject, and lacks robustness. this paper presents a modification of psmc by using neural network to tune psmc gains online, and implements both psmc and modified psmc control schemes in the robotic orthosis. experimental results demonstrate that the improved psmc method performs better on tracking with little degradation on safety for different loads and human subjects.
pid_controller	in this paper, a decoupled proportional- integral- derivative (pid) control approach for seismic control of smart structures is presented. first, the state space equation of a structure is transformed into modal coordinates and parameters of the modal pid control are separately designed in a reduced modal space. then, the feedback gain matrix of the controller is obtained based on the contribution of modal responses to the structural responses. the performance of the controller is investigated to adjust control force of piezoelectric friction dampers (pfds) in a benchmark base isolated building. in order to tune the modal feedback gain of the controller, a suitable trade-off among the conflicting objectives, i.e., the reduction of maximum modal base displacement and the maximum modal floor acceleration of the smart base isolated structure, as well as the maximum modal control force, is created using a multi-objective cuckoo search (mocs) algorithm. in terms of reduction of maximum base displacement and story acceleration, numerical simulations show that the proposed method performs better than other reported controllers in the literature. moreover, simulation results show that the pfds are able to efficiently dissipate the input excitation energy and reduce the damage energy of the structure. overall, the proposed control strategy provides a simple strategy to tune the control forces and reduces the number of sensors of the control system to the number of controlled stories.
digital_control	the interleaved multilevel dc-dc converters have advantages of low voltage stress of the switches and diodes and reduction of filter size. particularly series input parallel output (isop) configuration is well suited for high output voltage and large output current application but input series output series (isos) configuration enable the utilization of low voltage rating switches in high voltage input and high voltage output applications that require galvanic isolation. the series connection of the isolated dc-dc converters at the input side also can be used for higher voltage application. while multilevel topology offers many new features, it also necessitates a balance control of the input capacitors. the paper describes the operating principles of the balancing circuit, analyzes the fundamental relationships, introduces principles of the operation of the circuit. the paper shows experimental results based on a few practical application examples. the paper discusses design of the transformer with balancing winding for isop, isos and parallel connection of the dc-dc converters to provide independent voltage balancing of input capacitors.
lorentz_force_law	when a strong on-board magnet is moved relative to a conducting sheet, a circulating eddy current will be induced in the conductor. the eddy current in turn produces a magnetic field, which by lorentz force law, produces repulsive forces between the two magnetic fields. an experimental study on the electrodynamic suspension system was carried with a 1.5 m diameter rotary type test wheel. two types of on board magnets are tested. one is a htsc magnet and the other one is a halbach-arrayed permanent magnet. the lorentz forces of the two eds systems are measured and compared with theoretical and numerical calculations.
state_space_representation	the daily return and the realized volatility are simultaneously modeled in the stochastic volatility model with leverage and long memory. the dependent variable in the stochastic volatility model is the logarithm of the squared return, and its error distribution is approximated by a mixture of normals. in addition, the logarithm of the realized volatility is incorporated into the measurement equation, assuming that the latent log volatility follows an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (arfima) process to describe its long memory property. the efficient bayesian estimation method using markov chain monte carlo method (mcmc) was proposed and implemented in the state space representation. model comparisons are performed based on the marginal likelihood, and the volatility forecasting performances are investigated using s&p500 stock index returns.

control_engineering	one of the effect measures of improving water flow fluidity and solving city water pollution is water diversion from outside of an urban area. because of the different boundary condition, quantity of flow distribution and velocity is different for every river. the velocity of some river channels is even much smaller. in order to enhance the fluidity of those weak rivers with small velocity, to set up a series of sluice gates and to control gates by closing and opening in some need. thus water quantity is redistributed and the velocity is increased. for the need of investigating the effect of setting up and closing the gates, 2d unsteady river networks flow finite element model is established and verified. bases on the model, the velocity size and orientation of the every river and water levels are calculated at the condition of whether setting up gates. these numerical researches show that the water flow quantity and velocity of flow distribution are both increased significantly for the near of river. the maximum velocity increment 0.23 m/s, the maximum banked up water level is 0.014 m, the maximum water lowering is 0.05 m, this engineering effect is obvious and this provided quantity data for the projects plan and design.
control_engineering	the present paper considers a systematic approach within the framework of neural mathematics for constructing a computational procedure. this procedure aims to solve a class of problems arising from the control of the systems with distributed parameters; these systems are modeled by second-order one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations (hpdes) with non-standard boundary conditions. the procedure reveals an explicit algorithmic parallelism and is mainly based on the combination of two powerful ""tools"": a convergent method of lines (mol) and the cellular neural network (cnn) paradigm. the role of the courant-isaacson-rees rule and of the riemann invariants for a correct application of the mol is emphasized. the procedure is illustrated on a control engineering application the overhead crane with flexible cable - within a more general context which includes modeling based on the generalized hamilton variational principle, synthesis of a stabilizing controller via the control lyapunov functional (clf), qualitative analysis, numerical solving using the proposed computational procedure, numerical simulations and the evaluation of the performances for the closed loop system. the procedure ensures the convergence of the approximation, preserves the basic properties and the lyapunov stability of the solution of the initial problem and reduces the systematic errors.

system_identification	the conventional normalized subband adaptive filter (nsaf) using a constant step-size generally faces an inherent trade-off between the steady-state misalignment and the convergence rate. we propose herein a variable step-size nsaf algorithm by minimizing the mean-square deviation (msd) between the optimal weight vector and the weight vector estimate with the utilization of the shrinkage denoising technique. with the estimation error involved, in the step-size adaptation for each subband individually, the proposed algorithm is capable of tracking non-stationary environments. without the explicit whitening assumption of the input signal in each subband, the proposed algorithm exhibits low steady-state msd even when the input signal of each subband is colored. simulation results validate the low misalignment and good tracking ability of the proposed algorithm in system identification application.

state_space_representation	in this paper, we present a novel kernel adaptive recurrent filtering algorithm based on the autoregressive-moving-average (arma) model, which is trained with recurrent stochastic gradient descent in the reproducing kernel hilbert spaces. this kernelized recurrent system, the kernel adaptive arma (kaarma) algorithm, brings together the theories of adaptive signal processing and recurrent neural networks (rnns), extending the current theory of kernel adaptive filtering (kaf) using the representer theorem to include feedback. compared with classical feedforward kaf methods, the kaarma algorithm provides general nonlinear solutions for complex dynamical systems in a state-space representation, with a deferred teacher signal, by propagating forward the hidden states. we demonstrate its capabilities to provide exact solutions with compact structures by solving a set of benchmark nondeterministic polynomial-complete problems involving grammatical inference. simulation results show that the kaarma algorithm outperforms equivalent input-space recurrent architectures using first-and second-order rnns, demonstrating its potential as an effective learning solution for the identification and synthesis of deterministic finite automata.
digital_control	the design of ""lab on a chip"" microfluidic devices is, typically, preceded by a long and costly period of prototyping stages in which the system is gradually refined by an iterative process, involving the manufacturing of a physical prototype and the making of a lot of laboratory experiments. in this scenario, a virtual prototyping framework which allows the emulation of the behavior of the complete system is greatly welcome. this paper presents such a framework and details a virtual prototyping methodology able to soundly handle microfluidic behavior based on systemc-ams extensions. the use of these extensions will permit the communication of the developed microfluidic models with external digital or mixed signal devices. this allows the emulation of the whole lab on a chip system as it usually includes a digital control and a mixed-signal reading environment. moreover, as systemc-ams is also being extended to cover other physical domains within the catrene ca701 project, interactions with these domains will be possible, for example, with electromechanical or optical parts, should they be part of the system. the presented extensions that can manage the modeling of a micro-fluidic system are detailed. two approaches have been selected: to model the fluid analytically based on the poiseuille flow theory and to model the fluid numerically following the sph (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) approach. both modeling techniques are, by now, encapsulated under the tdf (timed data flow) moc (model of computation) of systemc-ams.

signal-flow_graph	a topological method for obtaining the jacobian and hessian matrices of active networks is presented. it is based on the replacement of the investigated network by using a nullor equivalent circuit and on the representation of the circuit passive part by a chan-mai signal-flow graph (cmsfg). the jacobian and the hessian matrix elements of the nullor network can be obtained by means of the some dependent variables of two or four isomorphic cmsfgs, respectively. two examples illustrate the proposed method.
electrical_network	external overvoltages constitute a typical cause of faults, damages and interruptions in the electrical networks' high-voltage transmission lines. in order to protect the lines and their equipment against lightning, overhead ground wires in combination with surge arresters are installed, improving the lightning performance of the system and reducing the annual failure rate. the achievement of low values of earth resistance is an essential requirement, since a good grounding system reduces considerably the corresponding insulation breakdowns. however, the behaviour of surge arresters in relation to the grounding resistance is different, as it depends on the position of the lightning hit. the current work is devoted to the sensitivity analysis of the failure probability of surge arresters with relation to the grounding resistance, investigating concurrently the effect of the arresters' installation interval and the energy absorption capability.
electricity	petrochemical plants require the addition and removal of energy to and from the process and the movement of material to, from, and within the process piping and vessels. these fundamental mass and energy transfer requirements are typically achieved through the use of process utilities, which include electricity, steam, fuel gas, cooling water and compressed air. utilities are responsible for a significant portion of the operating cost of a plant. therefore, reduction in the consumption of utilities is a common process optimisation area. the situation is different when it comes to the generation and transportation of these utilities, which are often overlooked with regard to optimisation. in this paper, the potential benefits of utility optimisation are illustrated with particular focus on the generation and transportation areas. the main objectives are reductions in electrical energy consumption and cost and are illustrated for a dual circuit cooling water system. this system is non-linear and also hybrid in the sense that it contains both continuous and discrete input variables, which significantly complicates the design and implementation of control and optimisation solutions. this paper illustrates how the cost and energy consumption of a hybrid system can be reduced through the implementation of hybrid non-linear model predictive control (hnmpc) and economic hnmpc (ehnmpc). the results are compared to that of a base case and an advanced regulatory control (arc) case, showing that significant additional benefit may be achieved through the implementation of these advanced control and optimisation techniques. the paper further illustrates that additional capital is not necessarily required for the implementation of these techniques.

analog_signal_processing	a variable ratio gearbox (vrg) can be used in the drivetrain of a small to medium-size wind turbine to improve aerodynamic efficiency. currently, all commercially-available wind turbines operate using a fixed-gear ratio between the turbine rotor and electrical generator. a vrg allows wind turbines, with a constant-speed generator, to discretely vary rotor speed and to achieve greater aerodynamic efficiency. the authors' previous results demonstrate the viability of the vrg design. this research quantifies the gain in efficiency for a vrg-enabled wind turbine based on wind data from representing all seven wind classifications. a method is also presented to identify turbine sites that provide the vrg with the greatest opportunities to increase production. the overall findings suggest that the vrg can benefit all wind turbines, irrespective of wind class, with some wind profiles in the study experiencing gains greater than 10%.

digital_control	the nonideal effects of the comparator and dead time in a synchronous controlled dc-dc converter adversely affect the stability of a four-switch noninverting-buck-boost (nibb) converter. the pulse-skipping phenomenon occurs in the mode-transition region near the boundary between the step-down and step-up regions, and this phenomenon leads to an unstable output voltage and an unpredictable output voltage ripple. however, these two results may damage the entire power system and application system. this brief proposes an enhanced duty-cycle-overlap control technique for a digitally controlled nibb converter. the proposed technique offers two duty cycle limitations for various conditions in the mode-transition region and ensures the stability of the digital controller and output voltage. moreover, this technique involves combining the duty cycles of both step-down and step-upmodes for deriving an accurate value of the output voltage. the experimental results derived from a digital controller implemented through a field-programmable-gate-array-based platform revealed that the output voltage of the nibb converter was stable throughout the transition region. the observed input voltage of the converter, provided by a li-ion battery, was 2.5-4.5 v, and the output voltage was typically 3.3 v, which is suitable for communication systems, audio systems, and i/o pad power supplies. the switching frequency was 1 mhz, and the maximum load current was 500 ma.
electrical_circuits	automata synchronization has many important applications, mostly in conformance testing of electrical circuits, self-correcting codes and protocol testing. finding a shortest synchronizing word cannot be done in polynomial time, assuming p not equal np. in some situations, especially for very large automata, finding such a word is almost impossible. therefore, we accept any synchronizing word that is reasonably short and can be calculated in short time. the existing algorithms are either polynomial (quick, but not optimal) or exponential (exact, but useless in case of large automata). in this paper we present a flexible algorithmic framework for synchronization. it allows the user to parameterize the algorithm to obtain a desired balance in terms of a trade-off between memory usage, runtime and optimality. we also discuss many practical issues that affect efficiency of an implementation. in particular, we design a new polynomial backward algorithm, which works significantly better than previously used heuristic algorithms. finally, we present detailed results of experiments involving automata up to 2000 states, which compare our algorithms in various settings and the other known algorithms, and check the impact of different parameters on the results.

electrical_circuits	colloidal behavior of a widely used non-ionic emulsifier, sorbitan monooleate (span80), was investigated in non-polar solvents (cyclohexane and xylene) using electrical impedance spectroscopy (eis). the electrical characteristics of the colloidal mixtures were measured with frequency scans ranging from 1 hz to 200 khz. the conductances at low frequencies were found to increase with an increase in span80 concentration. the source of conductivity for non-polar solvents using non-ionic emulsifiers is usually attributed to ionic impurities either in the span80 or in the non-polar solvents. the measured electrical characteristics for pure span80 and pure non-polar solvents revealed that the source of ionic conduction is impurities in span80. it was confirmed that the ionic impurities in the non-polar solvents are in form of aggregate of ions, ion-pairs, and triple ions which is unaffected with the emulsifier concentration. analyses using equivalent electrical circuits confirmed that the critical maxwell-wagner frequency is 0.6-1.8 hz for the mixtures. the conductance-concentration profiles for the mixtures at 1 hz showed transitions from a square root to a linear concentration dependence at the cmc. this indicated that the dissociation model holds below the cmc, while the fluctuation model applies above the cmc. the conductance profiles enabled estimates of the relative hydrophilic core radius and the fraction of charged micelles in both non-polar solvents.
electric_motor	the additional design consideration of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (phev) caused by its recharging capability requires an optimal hybrid powertrain control strategy to fully exploit the vehicle 's capability. amongst many aspects of control algorithm development and design optimisation, the advantage of including a pure electric vehicle (ev) mode in the vehicle driving modes of a phev with a post-transmission electric motor was studied in this research. for this purpose, architecture of a series-parallel phev was determined and its simulation model was developed. then, various simulations were conducted to evaluate technical merits of the pure ev mode in terms of fuel economy and emissions. the simulation results favourably supports inclusion of the pure ev mode as one of the driving modes in the powertrain control strategy of the studied phev model with a post-transmission electric motor.
control_engineering	the increasing pressures faced by manufacturers, the shortening of innovation cycles and the growing importance of high-efficiency manufacturing demand a higher versatility of factory automation. in order to achieve this target, engineering tasks currently performed manually need to be automated. in this case, ontologies emerge as a significant method for representing manufacturing knowledge in a machine-interpretable way. this knowledge can then be used by automated problem-solving methods to reconfigure the control software that coordinates and supervises manufacturing systems. besides, ontology can play a very important role in the process of creating as well as managing the knowledge. this paper addresses the important issues in developing domain-specific ontology for manufacturing used in industry 4.0 demonstration production line. a generic ontology is developed considering all the aspects about product from customized order to resulting production.
