computer-aided_design	in order to improve the fault monitoring performance of grounding electrode lines in ultra-high voltage dc (uhvdc) transmission systems, a novel fault monitoring approach based on the high-frequency voltage standing-wave ratio (vswr) is proposed in this paper. the vswr is defined considering a lossless transmission line, and the characteristics of the vswr under different conditions are analyzed. it is shown that the vswr equals 1 when the terminal resistance completely matches the characteristic impedance of the line, and when a short circuit fault occurs on the grounding electrode line, the vswr will be greater than 1. the vswr will approach positive infinity under metallic earth fault conditions, whereas the vswr in non-metallic earth faults will be smaller. based on these analytical results, a fault supervision criterion is formulated. the effectiveness of the proposed vswr-based fault supervision technique is verified with a typical uhvdc project established in power systems computer aided design/electromagnetic transients including dc(pscad/emtdc). simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy can reliably identify the grounding electrode line fault and has strong anti-fault resistance capability.
molecular_biology	lung cancer, which has a low survival rate, is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. smoking and air pollution are the major causes of lung cancer; however, numerous studies have demonstrated that genetic factors also contribute to the development of lung cancer. a family history of lung cancer increases the risk for the disease in both smokers and never-smokers. this review focuses on familial lung cancer, in particular on the familial aggregation of lung cancer. the development of familial lung cancer involves shared environmental and genetic factors among family members. familial lung cancer represents a good model for investigating the association between environmental and genetic factors, as well as for identifying susceptibility genes for lung cancer. in addition, studies on familial lung cancer may help to elucidate the etiology and mechanism of lung cancer, and may identify novel biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis, targeted therapy and improved prevention strategies. this review presents the aetiology and molecular biology of lung cancer and then systematically introduces and discusses several aspects of familial lung cancer, including the characteristics of familial lung cancer, population-based studies on familial lung cancer and the genetics of familial lung cancer.
northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are a class of small non-coding rnas (18-24 nucleotides (nt)) that regulate gene expression. mirnas exist widely in animals, plants and humans, and play fundamental roles in many biological processes, such as growth, development, differentiation and reproduction, etc. mirna is believed to be involved in the regulation of nearly 30% of all human genes and its expression level is closely related to some major diseases of mankind. thus, quantitive detection and expression analysis of mirna are significant to the understanding of functional mechanism of mirnas, the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and the development of the correlated gene drugs, etc. mirna detection is mostly based on the hybridization and amplification techniques of nucleic acids, which includs northern blotting technique, microarray, in situ hybridization, real-time reverse transcription pcr, isothermal rolling circle amplification and conjugated polymer-based mirna detection. with the discovery of mirna in different species and the thoroughly functional research of mirna, the detection methods have been improved continuously and the new techniques, involving amplification, labeled probe and detection, have been developed successively. this paper summarizes the progress of mirna detection, reviews the advantages and the disadvantages of all kinds of methods and prospects the mirna detection trends.
human_metabolism	purpose: demonstrate the utility of system dynamics computer modeling to study and gain insight into the impacts of physical activity and diet on weight gain and loss. methods: a holistic system dynamics computer model is presented that integrates the processes of human metabolism, hormonal regulation, body composition, nutrition, and physical activity. these processes are not independent of one another, and the model captures the complex interdependencies between them in the regulation of body weight and energy metabolism. the article demonstrates how such an integrative simulation model can serve as a viable laboratory tool for controlled experimentation to investigate the impacts of physical activity and diet on body weight and composition. results: in one experiment, weight loss from a moderate level of daily exercise was slightly less than the loss from dieting. although exercise did have a favorable impact on body composition by protecting against the loss in fat-free mass (ffm), it, however, failed to blunt the drop in resting energy expenditure (ree) that accompanies diet-based weight loss. the smaller loss in ffm did indeed induce a smaller drop in nominal ree, however, the preservation of ffm also affected a relatively larger loss in fm, which, in turn, induced a larger adaptive reduction in the metabolic rate. the two adaptations almost totally offset one another, causing minimal differences in ree. in a second experiment, exercise regimens of moderate- to high-level intensity proved counterproductive as weight-reducing strategies. however, when the diet was changed from a balanced composition to one that was highly loaded with carbohydrates, it became possible to sustain the intense exercise regimen over the experimental period and achieve a significant drop in body weight. conclusion: the results underscore the significant interaction effects between physical activity, diet, and body composition and demonstrate the utility of computer-based experimentation to study, gain insight into, and make predictions about their dynamics.
internal_combustion_engine	progressing limits on pollutant emissions oblige ship owners to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. fuel cells may provide a suitable solution, since they are fuel efficient while they emit few hazardous compounds. various choices can be made with regard to the type of fuel cell system and logistic fuel, and it is unclear which have the best prospects for maritime application. an overview of fuel cell types and fuel processing equipment is presented, and maritime fuel cell application is reviewed with regard to efficiency, gravimetric and volumetric density, dynamic behaviour, environmental impact, safety and economics. it is shown that low temperature fuel cells using liquefied hydrogen provide a compact solution for ships with a refuelling interval up to a tens of hours, but may result in total system sizes up to five times larger than high temperature fuel cells and more energy dense fuels for vessels with longer mission requirements. the expanding infrastructure of liquefied natural gas and development state of natural gas-fuelled fuel cell systems can facilitate the introduction of gaseous fuels and fuel cells on ships. fuel cell combined cycles, hybridisation with auxiliary electricity storage systems and redundancy improvements are identified as topics for further study.

genetics	in genome-wide association studies (gwas), generalization is the replication of genotype-phenotype association in a population with different ancestry than the population in which it was first identified. current practices for declaring generalizations rely on testing associations while controlling the family-wise error rate (fwer) in the discovery study, then separately controlling error measures in the follow-up study. this approach does not guarantee control over the fwer or false discovery rate (fdr) of the generalization null hypotheses. it also fails to leverage the two-stage design to increase power for detecting generalized associations. we provide a formal statistical framework for quantifying the evidence of generalization that accounts for the (in)consistency between the directions of associations in the discovery and follow-up studies. we develop the directional generalization fwer (fwerg) and fdr (fdrg) controlling r-values, which are used to declare associations as generalized. this framework extends to generalization testing when applied to a published list of single nucleotide polymorphism-(snp)-trait associations. our methods control fwerg or fdrg under various snp selection rules based on p-values in the discovery study. we find that it is often beneficial to use a more lenient p-value threshold than the genome-wide significance threshold. in a gwas of total cholesterol in the hispanic community health study/study of latinos (hchs/sol), when testing all snps with p-values <5x10-8 (15 genomic regions) for generalization in a large gwas of whites, we generalized snps from 15 regions. but when testing all snps with p-values <6.6x10-5 (89 regions), we generalized snps from 27 regions.
fluid_mechanics	the fluid mechanics of microfluidics is distinctively simpler than the fluid mechanics of macroscopic systems. in macroscopic systems effects such as non-laminar flow, convection, gravity etc. need to be accounted for all of which can usually be neglected in microfluidic systems. still, there exists only a very limited selection of channel cross-sections for which the navier-stokes equation for pressure-driven poiseuille flow can be solved analytically. from these equations, velocity profiles as well as flow rates can be calculated. however, whenever a cross-section is not highly symmetric (rectangular, elliptical or circular) the navier-stokes equation can usually not be solved analytically. in all of these cases, numerical methods are required. however, in many instances it is not necessary to turn to complex numerical solver packages for deriving, e.g., the velocity profile of a more complex microfluidic channel cross-section. in this paper, a simple spreadsheet analysis tool (here: microsoft excel) will be used to implement a simple numerical scheme which allows solving the navier-stokes equation for arbitrary channel cross-sections.
southern_blotting	soybean transformation by ovary-drip was improved by optimizing the length of the transformation pathway by cutting the styles. these modifications facilitated soybean transformation manipulation and improved transformation reproducibility and efficiency. using a linear minimal gus gene cassette as the foreign dna, a maximum transformation frequency of 11% was obtained in flowers of the soybean cultivar 'liaodou 14' with their styles mostly removed, whereas removal of only the stigma, partial style cutting and partial ovary cutting gave transformation frequencies of 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. an average transformation frequency of 8.2% was obtained when 619 flowers from three soybean cultivars ('liaodou 14', 'liaodou 13', and 'tiefeng 29') were transformed by this optimized method. southern blotting analysis showed that the gus reporter gene (encoding beta-glucuronidase) was stably inherited with a simple pattern. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and gus staining confirmed the expression of the gus gene in transgenic plants.
immunology	background: the identification of immunogenic regions on the surface of antigens, which are able to be recognized by antibodies and to trigger an immune response, is a major challenge for the design of new and effective vaccines. the prediction of such regions through computational immunology techniques is a challenging goal, which will ultimately lead to a drastic limitation of the experimental tests required to validate their efficiency. however, current methods are far from being sufficiently reliable and/or applicable on a large scale. results: we developed sepia, a b-cell epitope predictor from the protein sequence, which is sufficiently fast to be applicable on a large scale. the originality of sepia lies in the combination of two classifiers, a naive bayesian and a random forest classifier, through a voting algorithm that exploits the advantages of both. it is based on 13 sequence-based features, whose values in a 9-residue sequence window are compiled to predict the epitope/non-epitope state of the central residue. the features are related to the type of amino acid, its conservation in homologous proteins, and its tendency of being exposed to the solvent, soluble, flexible, and disordered. the highest signal is obtained from statistical amino acid preferences, but all 13 features contribute non-negligibly in the predictor. sepia 's average prediction accuracy is limited, with an auc score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) that reaches 0.65 both in 10-fold cross-validation and on an independent test set. it is nevertheless slightly higher than that of other methods evaluated on the same test set. conclusions: sepia was applied to a test protein whose epitopes are known, human beta 2 adrenergic g-protein-coupled receptor, with promising results. although the actual auc score is rather low, many of the predicted epitopes cluster together and overlap the experimental epitope region. the reasons underlying the limitations of sepia and of all other b-cell epitope predictors are discussed.
computer-aided_design	isogeometric analysis has been introduced as an alternative to finite element methods in order to simplify the integration of computer-aided design (cad) software and the discretization of variational problems of continuum mechanics. in contrast with the finite element case, the basis functions of isogeometric analysis are often not nodal. as a consequence, there are fat interfaces which can easily lead to an increase in the number of interface variables after a decomposition of the parameter space into subdomains. building on earlier work on the deluxe version of the bddc (balancing domain decomposition by constraints) family of domain decomposition algorithms, several adaptive algorithms are developed in this paper for scalar elliptic problems in an effort to decrease the dimension of the global, coarse component of these preconditioners. numerical experiments provide evidence that this work can be successful, yielding scalable and quasi-optimal adaptive bddc algorithms for isogeometric discretizations.
southern_blotting	coccinia grandis l (family cucurbitaceae), a perennial dioecious herb with heteromorphic sex chromosomes has the quality of a model plant for analysis of sexual evolution in angiosperms. yet, little is known about the physical side, genetic orientation and substitution behavior of key gender-defining factors in this important plant species. screening of genomic dna with rapd primers was used for sex diagnosis and gender specificity of c. grandis in this study. bulk analyses of pooled dna from male and female genotypes resulted in the isolation of a putative male specific sex marker cgmsm. a sequence characterized amplified region (scar) marker cgy1 designed from cgmsm amplified an 829 bp fragment in the male c. grandis but not in the female plants. southern blotting confirmed it as a single copy locus in the male genome. further, the cgy1 marker accurately identified 11 male and 6 female genotypes from 17 individuals of c. grandis with unknown sex. sequence homology revealed high similarity between cgmsm (cgy1) and the putative mads-box domain of the apetala3 (ap3) mads-box gene which is responsible for development of petals and stamens in flowering plants. thus, the scar marker cgy1 could be used as an efficient tool for early sex identification in c. grandis and forms the basis for characterization of genes associated with evolutionary pathways in sexual dimorphism.

northern_blotting	eucheuma denticulatum, an economically and industrially important red alga, is a valuable marine resource. although micrornas (mirnas) play an essential role in gene post-transcriptional regulation, no research has been conducted to identify and characterize mirnas in e. denticulatum. in this study, we identified 134 mirnas (133 conserved mirnas and one novel mirna) from 2,997,135 small-rna reads by high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis. blast searching against mirbase uncovered 126 potential mirna families. a conservation and diversity analysis of predicted mirna families in different plant species was performed by comparative alignment and homology searching. a total of 4 and 13 randomly selected mirnas were respectively validated by northern blotting and stem-loop reverse transcription pcr, thereby demonstrating the reliability of the mirna sequencing data. altogether, 871 potential target genes were predicted using psrobot and targetfinder. target genes classification and enrichment were conducted based on gene ontology analysis. the functions of target gene products and associated metabolic pathways were predicted by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis. a cytoscape network was constructed to explore the interrelationships of mirnas, mirna-target genes and target genes. a large number of mirnas with diverse target genes will play important roles for further understanding some essential biological processes in e. denticulatum. the uncovered information can serve as an important reference for the protection and utilization of this unique red alga in the future.
strength_of_materials	the development of fibre-reinforced polymer (frp) piping with high corrosion resistance and specific properties is an attractive engineering proposition with high potential. advantageous properties make frp piping a potential candidate for replacing metallic piping structure in the oil and gas industry. despite the advantages associated with frp, their application is limited due to, in part, unsatisfactory methods for joining composite subcomponents and inadequate knowledge of failure mechanism under different loading conditions. aim of the present paper is to study the effect of pipe scaling on the strength of adhesively bonded frp pipes. using finite element analysis, a study was performed to investigate dimensional effects on adhesive joint strength based on strength-of-materials and fracture mechanics considerations. results indicate a shift in failure from adhesive to composite material with increasing pipe diameter. the tsai-wu and von mises failure criteria were employed for the strength analysis of composite pipe sections and the adhesive material, respectively. a fracture mechanics approach was used to assess changes from cohesive failure (within adhesive) to interfacial failure (adhesive/frp interface) with increasing pipe diameters.

immunology	the immune response is determined by the speed of the t cell reaction to antigens assured by a state of readiness for proliferation and cytokine secretion. proliferation, apoptosis and motion of many cell types are controlled by cytoplasmic proteases - mu- and m-calpain - and their inhibitor calpastatin, together forming the ""calpain-calpastatin system"" (ccs), assumed to modify their targets only upon activation-dependent cytoplasmic ca2+ increase. contrastingly to this notion, using quantitative real time pcr and semiquantitative flow cytometry respectively, we show here that the ccs genes are constitutively expressed, and that both calpains are constitutively active in resting, circulating human cd4(+) and cd8(+) lymphocytes. furthermore, we demonstrate that calpain inhibition in the resting t cells prevents them from proliferation in vitro and greatly reduces secretion of multiple cytokines. the mechanistic reason for these effects of calpain inhibition on t cell functions might be the demonstrated significant reduction of the expression of active (phosphorylated) upstream signalling molecules, including the phospholipase c gamma, p56lck and nf kappa b, in the inhibitor-treated cells. thus, we propose that the constitutive, self-regulatory calpain-calpastatin system activity in resting human t cells is a necessary, controlling element of their readiness for complex and effective response to antigenic challenge.
internal_combustion_engine	decreasing air pollution concentrations from internal combustion engine (ice), especially agricultural machines and transporters, is more interested. the current treatment methods have many disadvantages, such as low treatment efficiency, high cost, and complex operation. therefore, in this study a gas pollution treatment model from ice by using cold-plasma is designed and manufactured to solve above problems. maha emission testers for diesel and gasoline at the center motor vehicle registration 50-06v at hcm city are used for results evaluation. the results show that the treatment efficiency of co, co2, hc and nox are about 97%, 95%, 34% and 22%, respectively. the model is portable 260x400x140mm, 8kg and plugin 110v/50hz or 12 v dc.
genetics	cyclists in the tour de france are endurance specialists. twin and family studies have shown that approximately 50% of the variance in a number of performance-related phenotypes (whether measured at baseline, i.e., natural talent, or in response to training) including those important to cycling can be explained by genetic variation. research into the specific genetic variants that are responsible has identified over 200 genes containing common genetic variants involved in the genetic predisposition to physical performance. however, typically these explain only a small portion of the variance, perhaps 1-2% and collectively they rarely explain anything approaching the 50% of the variance identified in the twin and family studies. thus, there is a gap in our understanding of the relationship between heritability and performance. this gap may be bridged by investigation of rare variants or epigenetic variation or by altering study designs through increased collaborations to pool existing cohorts together. initial findings from such efforts show promising results. this mini-review will touch on the genetics and epigenetics of sporting performance, how they relate to cyclists in the tour de france and where best future efforts may be directed as well as discuss some preliminary research findings.
genetics	alopecia areata (aa) is a common and stressful disorder that results in hair loss, and resistant to treatment in some cases. experimental and clinical evidence suggests that aa is caused by autoimmune attack against the hair follicles. the precise pathomechanism, however, remains unknown. here, we focus on the recent progress in multidisciplinary approaches to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and new treatments of aa in 996 publications from january 2010 to july 2016, and provide an overview of the current understanding in clinical management and research directions.

cell_biology	s6ks are major effectors of the mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, signaling for increased protein synthesis and cell growth in response to insulin, amp/atp levels, and amino acids. deregulation of this pathway has been related to disorders and diseases associated with metabolism, such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer. s6k family is composed of two main members, s6k1 and s6k2, which comprise different isoforms resulted from alternative splicing or alternative start codon use. although important molecular functions have been associated with p70-s6k1, the most extensively studied isoform, the s6k2 counterpart lacks information. in the present study, we performed immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry (ms) analysis of flag-tagged p70-s6k1 and p54-s6k2 interactomes, after expression in hek293 cells. protein lists were submitted to crapome (contaminant repository for affinity purification) and saint (significance analysis of interactome) analysis, which allowed the identification of high-scoring interactions. by a comparative approach, p70-s6k1 interacting proteins were predominantly related to ""cytoskeleton"" and ""stress response,"" whereas p54-s6k2 interactome was more associated to ""transcription,"" ""splicing,"" and ""ribosome biogenesis."" moreover, we have found evidences for new targets or regulators of the s6k protein family, such as proteins ncl, npm1, eif2 alpha, xrcc6, parp1, and ilf2/ilf3 complex. this study provides new information about the interacting networks of s6ks, which may contribute for future approaches to a better understanding of the mtor/s6k pathway.
materials_engineering	preparing an effective workforce in high technology is the goal of both academic and industry training, and has been the engine that drives innovation and product development in the united states for over a century. during the last 50 years, technician training has comprised a combination of two-year academic programs, internships and apprentice training, and extensive on-the-job training (ojt). recently, and especially in silicon valley, technicians have four-year college degrees, as well as relevant hands-on training. characterization in general, and microscopy in particular, is an essential tool in process development, manufacturing and qa/qc, and failure analysis. training for a broad range of skills and practice is challenging, especially for community colleges. workforce studies (sri/boeing) suggest that even four year colleges often do not provide the relevant training and experience in laboratory skills, especially design of experiments and analysis of data. companies in high-tech further report difficulty in finding skilled labor, especially with industry specific experience. foothill college, in partnership with ucsc, sjsu, and nasa-ames, has developed a microscopy training program embedded in a research laboratory, itself a partnership between university and government, providing hands-on experience in advanced instrumentation, experimental design and problem solving, with real-world context from small business innovators, in an environment called 'the collaboratory'. the program builds on afm-sem training at foothill, and provides affordable training in fe-sem and tem through a cost recovery model. in addition to instrument and engineering training, the collaboratory also supports academic and personal growth through a multiplayer social network of students, faculty, researchers, and innovators.
molecular_biology	the emergence of proteomics has led to major technological advances in mass spectrometry (ms). these advancements not only benefitted ms-based high-throughput proteomics but also increased the impact of mass spectrometry on the field of structural and molecular biology. here, we review how state-of-the-art ms methods, including native ms, top-down protein sequencing, cross-linking-ms, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange-ms, nowadays enable the characterization of biomolecular structures, functions, and interactions. in particular, we focus on the role of mass spectrometry in integrated structural and molecular biology investigations of biological macromolecular complexes and cellular machineries, highlighting work on crispr-cas systems and eukaryotic transcription complexes.
immunology	the tam family of receptors (i.e., tyro3, axl, and mertk), and their ligands growth arrest specific factor 6 (gas6) and protein s (pros1) contribute to several oncogenic processes, such as cell survival, invasion, migration, chemo-resistance, and metastasis, whereby expression often correlates with poor clinical outcomes. in recent years, there has been great interest in the study of tam receptors in cancer, stemming both from their roles as oncogenic signaling receptors, as well as their roles in tumor immunology. as a result, several classes of tam inhibitors that include small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, decoy receptors, as well as novel strategies to target tam ligands are being developed. this paper will review the biology of tam receptors and their ligands with a focus on cancer, as well as evidence-based data for the continued pursuit of tam/gas6 inhibitors in clinical practice.
strength_of_materials	conveyor belt is one of the most common types of continuous handling equipment used for moving rocks of various sizes horizontally or inclined. from researches done in the exploitation of mineral resources and rocks and from the strength of materials calculations in this paper is observed above the conveyor sizing and other elements of the transporter requires knowing how belt traction forces (tensions thereof) varies on the conveyor length. in all cases the operation of the conveyor belt must be provided without engaging the slip phenomenon and limiting its displacement (between sets of rollers) so conveyor can operating at optimum parameters. the materials that make up a conveyor belt can be divided into two categories: materials for coating plates or outer shell and a resistance part, areas with inserts that can be textile and steel cables. because the bands are subjected to tensile efforts and wear phenomena we determine the maximum strength they can operate without going into permanent deformation regime. conveyor belt dimensioning calculations and other elements of a conveyor varies depending on its length and the carrier operating situations. we can see, also, that sizing conveyor belt and other conveyor components require knowledge of how belt traction forces (tensions thereof) varies along the length of the conveyor. the tensions from the conveyor belt will be study for the climb section and for the descend section. it mentions that the specific resistance to motion of the belt on full branch, consisting of resistances due: current material deformation, rotation rollers camps because pressing rubber layer and roll belt and belt bending. since current material strength due to deformation and bending belt represents a large percentage of total specific resistance to motion, it follows that resistance decreases with decreasing displacement belt between rollers and increase with the effort in belt, respectively. this explains that resistance decreases with increasing length of conveyor (especially when its initial stretch is great), and with increasing conveyor tilt too. also, we observe, from the values of forces calculated in the paper, that the resistance to rotation of the roller bearings decreases with increasing load on the roll, hence the values adopted for specific resistance to movement can be more larger on the empty branch than on the full. knowing how to calculate resistances to motion of the belt, you can fix that occur belt efforts through the points made on the contour method, starting point of the drum motor development and ending point of winding it. these movement resistances calculated for empty and full branches are needed to precisely determine the installed power of the conveyor belt.
machine_design	in this work, we designed a visitor counting machine (vcm) in terms of power efficient circuit using family of three different io standards which are lvttl, mobile ddr, hsul_12. these three different io standards are compared with each other on the basis of clock power, logic power, signal power, ios, leakage power and total power consumption to search the most power efficient one. in order to find the most efficient circuitry, we collected the data of power consumption of these three io standards and then compare them. we have analysed our circuitry at different frequencies of 0.1ghz, 1ghz, 10ghz & 100ghz. in our experiment, there is 99.27% power saving when 0.1ghz is used in place of 100ghz using mobile ddr and we also concluded that when we replace lvttl by hsul at 10ghz frequency, power saving of 96.10% is achieved. to design this energy efficient visitor counting machine, we are using verilog as hdl, xilinx ise 14.2 simulator with artix-7 fpga.
thermodynamics	high strain rate(6.2 x 10(4) s(-1)) loading of zk60 magnesium alloy was carried out with radial collapse of a thick-walled cylinder technology. the evolution of precipitates in solution-treated and peak-aged zk60 magnesium alloy during high strain rate deformation was studied by transmission electron microscopy (tem) for the first time. a large number of elongated rod-like phase were precipitated in solution-treated sample after impacting; the rod-like phases in peak-aged sample experienced shortening and thinning, and some of which finally transformed into spherical-like phases, namely the rod-like phases were preliminarily dissolved into the matrix. based on thermodynamics and kinetics analyses, the high strain rate, high density dislocation, high shear stress and adiabatic temperature rise induced by explosive impact process make it possible for precipitates to precipitate and dissolve preliminarily within about 3.1 mu s.

hydraulics	in the spawning environment of salmonids, the quality of the intergravel flow is an essential abiotic requirement for the survival success of incubated embryos. as one of the most frequently investigated anthropogenic environmental impacts, the enhanced mobilization of fine sediments (< 1 mm) and their entry into riverine ecosystems is considered as a major cause for the degradation of a variety of biological processes and habitats, including the spawning habitats of salmonids. in catchments draining crystalline bedrock, however, like the bohemian massif in the northern part of austria, the excessive loading of river channels with coarse sand and fine gravel sediments (d = 1-10 mm) and less cohesive than fines is common as a consequence of altered catchment land use. here, far less understanding exists of the mechanism and the possible implications of coarse sand infiltration on the functioning of the intergravel flow in salmonid redds. to investigate the intergravel flow hydraulics in response to coarse sand infiltration (d-50 = 2 mm) in brown trout spawning redds (salmo trutta fario) under controlled conditions, a laboratory flume experiment with three infiltration scenarios was conducted: (1) no infiltration; (2) segmental infiltration; and (3) full section infiltration. a more than two times drop in the average intergravel flow velocity was documented from scenario 1 (5.85 cms(-1)) to scenario 2 (2.53 cms(-1)) and another clear reduction was seen from scenario 2 (2.53 cms(-1)) to scenario 3 (1.61 cms(-1)). moreover, in scenario 3, a clear reduction of the intergravel flow distance traveled was observed. based on the findings we conclude that future considerations regarding the sustainable catchment management of salmonid fisheries should include programs to reduce not only the excessive entry of fines, but, in the relevant catchments, also the entry of excessive coarse sand into the riverine ecosystem. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.

machine_design	machine design is the most perspective field of study in the faculty of mechanical engineering (fme) at the university of west bohemia with regards to the demand for graduates in this field. these days, the main issue of higher education in the czech republic related to machine design is the lack of opportunities for students of machine design to acquire practical knowledge and experience in the field. the problem is that engineering companies offer work experience only to individual students as they try to hire them after graduation. but engineering companies are not motivated enough to contribute to the machine design teaching process by providing knowledge and experience to the majority of students. as this is not going to change soon, universities have to provide real applications to its students instead. currently, there are not enough opportunities for students to acquire practical knowledge in the field during their studies. the required amount of work experience for engineering students in the czech republic is only one week, which is insufficient in comparison with the german system, where internship semesters are a mandatory part of studying at a fachhochschule (university of applied sciences). it is necessary to provide practical information and real applications in class to compensate for the lack of practical experience. fme is concerned in this matter and it has launched the project for enhancement of the teaching process. a new concept of electronic learning materials for machine design was developed as a part of the project. the learning materials were developed by academics in cooperation with local engineering companies to provide students and academics at fme with real design projects reworked for learning purposes. the machine design teaching process is complicated due to the complexity of the mechanical design process, as it has its own particularities which need to be considered while creating learning materials. when describing the mechanical design process, not only the design process itself has to be described. also the production processes, project schedules, economic aspects of the design project, legislative, technical standards and regulations have to be described as well. as these parts of the mechanical design process affect each other, it is important to describe them in the context of the mechanical design process to show the interconnection between them. the electronic form of learning materials was selected as it offers many advantages over the standard printed form. the main reason for selecting the electronic form of learning materials is the ability to work with computer-aided engineering (cae) models. three-dimensional cae models replaced drawing boards in every engineering company several years ago and thus it is important to include cae models in the machine design teaching process. thanks to the technology of exporting cae models to the standard portable document format (pdf) it is possible to modify cae models for learning purposes and use them as a learning tool. cae models can be enhanced with a large amount of information regarding a design project such as manufacturing processes, materials or component functions and can be supplemented by technical drawings, illustrated project descriptions and further information. all the learning material is converted into a single pdf file so that every student can access it anywhere, anytime. versatility and interactivity are the biggest benefits of the new electronic learning materials. the new electronic learning materials can be used when explaining new subject matter to show its application, or as a basis for students' assignments, individual work, teamwork or dissertations. the sample electronic learning materials are being produced and will be made available to students through the courseware of the university of west bohemia. this paper intends to present the learning materials and describe their form, structure and content and their benefits for academics and students of machine design.
enzymology	self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (scc-dftb) is a promising method for hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (qm/mm) simulations of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. the acylation reaction of fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah), a promising drug target, was investigated by applying a scc-dftb/charmm27 scheme. calculated potential energy barriers resulted in reasonable agreement with experiments for oleamide (oa) and oleoylmethyl ester (ome) substrates, outperforming previous calculations performed at the pm3/charmm22 level. furthermore, the experimental preference of faah in hydrolyzing oa faster than ome was adequately reproduced by calculations. all these findings indicate that the scc-dftb/charmm27 approach can be successfully applied to mechanistic investigations of faah-catalyzed reactions.
cell_biology	purpose of reviewto provide examples of mitochondria-specific metabolic events that influence tumor cell biology, and of metabolism-related mitochondrial biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer cells.recent findingscancer cell mitochondria are rewired to optimally serve the cancer cell under various conditions of cellular stress. the nonexhaustive list of mitochondrial alterations that support cancer cell proliferation, survival, and/or progression includes upregulation of oxidative metabolism and use of alternative substrates, oncometabolites, increased superoxide production, mutated mitochondrial dna, and altered mitochondrial morphology and dynamics. potential therapeutic targets include fatty acid oxidation, voltage-dependent anion channel-1, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and complex i.summarysome phenotypical traits, for example, chemoresistance and metastasis, are likely regulated by a fine-tuned balance between several metabolic processes and events that are upregulated in parallel and are also dependent on microenvironmental cues. many metabolism-related mitochondrial biomarkers show prognostic value, but the biological interpretation of the data may be confounded by the overall metabolic status and context. understanding metabolic regulation of stemness is important for targeting cancer stem cells. therapeutic targeting of cancer cell mitochondria remains experimental but promising, and more predictive markers will be needed for metabolism-based treatments and personalized medicine.
hydraulics	among the different processes for producing biodiesel fuel, the use of methanol under conditions near to the critical point is a promissory alternative. the reactive distillation has been proposed to reduce the energy requirements of the esterification step in this process. such reductions are accompanied by reductions in the total annual costs and the environmental impact. however, due to the conditions under which the column should be operated, special care must be taken in the design of the trays and their hydraulic performance. proper design of the trays should prevent operational problems. in this work, a strategy for the mechanical design of sieve trays in a homogeneous reactive distillation column is presented. in the column, oleic acid is esterified with methanol under a pressure of 7 mpa. the designs obtained are tested in terms of hydraulics through cfd simulations. cfd analysis is carried out using ansys fluent software.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: high mobility group box-1 (hmgb1), a non-histone protein, plays an important role in autoimmune diseases. however, the significance of hmgb1 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis has not been reported. the purpose of this study was to explore whether hmgb1 participates in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis, and whether glycyrrhizin (gl), a direct inhibitor of hmgb1, attenuates the severity of thyroid inflammatory infiltration in a murine model of autoimmune thyroiditis. methods: a total of 80 male nod. h-2(h4) mice were randomly divided into a control or iodine supplement (nai) group at four weeks of age, and the control group was fed with regular water, whereas the nai group was supplied with 0.005% sodium iodine water. another 24 male nod. h-2(h4) mice were also randomized into three groups (eight mice per group) as follows: control, nai, and gl treatment after iodine supplementation (nai + gl). the nod.h-2 (h4) mice were fed with 0.005% sodium iodide water for eight weeks to enhance autoimmune thyroiditis. after iodine treatment, the mice received intraperitoneal injections of gl for four weeks. the severity of lymphocytic infiltration in the thyroid gland was measured by histopathological studies. the serum levels of hmgb1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (il)-6, il-1 beta, and thyroglobulin antibody titers were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. hmgb1 expression was measured by immunohistochemical staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction. tlr2, hmgb1, myd88, and nuclear transcription factor kappa b were measured by western blot. results: the mrna expression of hmgb1 was significantly higher at 8 and 16 weeks in the nai group than it was in the control group. serum levels of thyroglobulin antibodies, hmgb1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, il-6, and il-1 beta were significantly increased in the nai group, but they were dramatically attenuated with gl injection. the prevalence of thyroiditis and the infiltration of lymphocytes were significantly decreased in the nai + gl group. gl administration also significantly reduced the protein expression of tlr2, myd88, hmgb1 and nuclear transcription factor jb in the thyroid gland and attenuated the severity of thyroiditis. conclusion: hmgb1 may play a crucial role in autoimmune thyroiditis by causing inflammatory infiltration, thus increasing the severity of autoimmune thyroiditis. gl effectively attenuated thyroiditis in the iodine-induced nod. h-2(h4) mice via a molecular mechanism related to the inhibition of tlr2-hmgb1 signaling.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background and objectivemore than 100 salivary constituents have been found to show levels significantly different in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) from those found in healthy controls, and therefore have been suggested to be potential salivary biomarkers for oscc detection. however, many of these potential oscc salivary biomarkers are also involved in chronic inflammation, and whether the levels of these biomarkers could be affected by the presence of chronic periodontitis was not known. the objective of this pilot study was therefore to measure the levels of seven previously reported potential oscc salivary mrna biomarkers in patients with chronic periodontitis and compare them to levels found in patients with oscc and healthy controls. the seven salivary mrnas were interleukin (il)-8, il-1, dual specificity phosphatase 1, h3 histone family 3a, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, s100 calcium-binding protein p (s100p) and spermidine/spermine n1-acetyltransferase 1. material and methodsunstimulated whole saliva samples were collected from a total of 105 human subjects from the following four study groups: oscc; cpns (chronic periodontitis, moderate to severe degree, non-smokers); cps (chronic periodontitis, moderate to severe degree, smokers); and healthy controls. levels of each mrna in patient groups (oscc or chronic periodontitis) relative to the healthy controls were determined by a pre-amplification reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach with nested gene-specific primers. results were recorded and analyzed by the bio-rad cfx96 real-time system. mean fold changes between each pair of patient vs. control groups were analyzed by the mann-whitney u-test with bonferroni corrections. resultsonly s100p showed significantly higher levels in patients with oscc compared to both patients with cpns (p = 0.003) and cps (p = 0.007). the difference in s100p levels between patients with oscc and healthy controls was also marginally significant (p = 0.009). there was no significant difference in the levels of salivary il-8, il-1 and dual specificity phosphatase 1 mrnas between patients with oscc and patients with cpns (p = 0.510, 0.058 and 0.078, respectively); no significant difference in levels of salivary ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 and spermine n1-acetyltransferase mrnas between patients with oscc and patients with cps (p = 0.318 and 0.764, respectively); and no significant difference in levels of the h3 histone family 3a mrna between patients with oscc and either cps (p = 0.449) or healthy controls (p = 0.107). conclusionssalivary s100p mrna could be a reliable biomarker for oscc detection, regardless of the presence of chronic periodontitis. the presence of chronic periodontitis could significantly affect the levels of the other six mrnas, and negatively influence reliability for using them as biomarkers for oral cancer detection.
internal_combustion_engine	in this paper, several kinds of improved modes for exhaust gas turbocharging (egt) have been investigated on the transient performances, including steam-assisted turbocharging (sat), electronically controlled turbocharging (ect) and supercharger-exhaust gas turbocharging (set). a turbocharged gasoline engine was employed a the study object, which was conducted bench test firstly to get basic data for building and calibrating the simulation model. then, an accurate and reliable gt-power model in steady and transient engine operation was developed. on this basis, the transient processes of four types of engines: egt engine, set engine, sat engine and ect engine were investigated by simulation and comparative analysis. the results show that set, sat and ect can reduce the response time and fuel consumption in acceleration process. the response time of various turbocharging approaches follows the descending sequence of egt, sat, ect and set. at the speed of 2000 r/min (from idling to full load), compared with egt engine, the specific fuel consumption (sfc) of set engine is decreased by 23.3%, while it can be reduced by 38.2% and 36.3% in sat engine and ect engine, respectively. finally, to reveal the improvement potentials of sat and ect, both of them were re-matched with a larger turbine without wastegate. the results indicate that the torque and thermal efficiency of sat and ect engines can be further improved, while the acceleration equilibrium time is increased.

hydraulics	this work presents an application of the forward and inverse predictive modeling methodology of cacuci and ionescu-bujor (2010) in the inverse mode to determine, within a tight a priori specified convergence criterion and overall accuracy, an unknown time-dependent boundary condition (specifically, the time-dependent inlet acid concentration) for a dissolver model case study by using measurements of the state function (specifically, the time-dependent acid concentration) at a specified location (specifically, in the dissolver 's compartment farthest from the inlet). the unknown time-dependent boundary condition is described by 635 unknown discrete scalar parameters. this forward and inverse predictive modeling methodology uses the maximum entropy principle to construct an optimal approximation of the unknown a priori distribution by using the a priori known mean values and uncertainties characterizing the model parameters, along with the computed and experimentally measured model responses and their covariances. this a priori distribution is subsequently combined using bayes' theorem with the likelihood provided by the computational model. the first-order response sensitivities serve as weighting functions in this objective combination of computational and experimental information. the use of the maximum entropy principle enables the forward and inverse predictive modeling of cacuci and ionescu-bujor (2010) to construct an intrinsic regularizing metric for solving any inverse problem. in the present dissolver case study, the unknown time-dependent boundary condition is predicted by the methodology within an a priori selected convergence criterion, without user intervention and/or introduction of arbitrary regularization parameters, as the currently popular procedures need to do. this predictive modeling methodology yields optimally calibrated values for all model parameters, with reduced predicted uncertainties, as well as optimal (best-estimate) predicted values for the model responses (in this case study, the time-dependent acid concentrations in the dissolver 's compartments), also with reduced predicted uncertainties. notably, even though the experimental data pertain solely to the compartment farthest from the inlet (where the data were measured), the application of this predictive modeling methodology actually improves the predicted values and reduces their predicted uncertainties not only in the compartment in which the data were actually measured but also throughout the entire dissolver, including the compartment farthest from the measurements (i.e., at the inlet). this is because this forward and inverse predictive modeling methodology combines and transmits information simultaneously over the entire phase-space, comprising all time steps and spatial locations. these results underscore the importance of this work in presenting the objective resolution (i.e., resolution in the absence of user-defined subjective adjustment of arbitrary regularization parameters) of a time-dependent inverse case study of potential importance to diversion activities associated with proliferation and international safeguards. the results obtained in this work establish confidence in the dissolver model 's accuracy for simulating the acid concentrations required to dissolve used nuclear fuel. in turn, these results will be used to generate source terms for key reprocessing facility components downstream and to support material accountability for nuclear safeguards.
fluid_mechanics	laboratory experiments were conducted in a large-scale meandering compound channel to investigate the flow patterns at the apex and cross-over sections. an equation in curvilinear co-ordinates was derived from the momentum equation and the flow continuity equation. in this equation, two shear stress terms are ignored due to their negligible contributions such that simple expressions are obtained. several groups of experimental data from the published literature were used to verify this model. comparison of the experimental and predictive results indicates that the proposed method is capable of accurately forecasting the stage discharge in meandering compound channels. finally, the simple analytical solution of this model and the velocity parameter are further discussed.
manufacturing_engineering	the implementation of virtual practices, to complement traditional practices has turned out to be an efficient tool to solve the classical problems occurring in the teaching of technological subjects, such as the manufacture engineering field. in the current work, the integration of virtual practice sets is analysed by means of an unified platform, as an extra contribution to previous developments, generating the manufacturing virtual laboratory of the department of manufacturing engineering of the university of malaga.
enzymology	gram-negative bacteria possess a characteristic outer membrane, of which the lipid a constituent elicits a strong host immune response through the toll-like receptor 4 complex, and acts as a component of the permeability barrier to prevent uptake of bactericidal compounds. lipid a species comprise the bulk of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and are produced through a multistep biosynthetic pathway conserved in most gram-negative bacteria. the final steps in this pathway involve the secondary acylation of lipid a precursors. these are catalyzed by members of a superfamily of enzymes known as lysophospholipid acyltransferases (lplats), which are present in all domains of life and play important roles in diverse biological processes. to date, characterization of this clinically important class of enzymes has been limited by a lack of structural information and the availability of only low-throughput biochemical assays. in this work, we present the structure of the bacterial lplat protein lpxm, and we describe a high-throughput, label-free mass spectrometric assay to characterize acyltransferase enzymatic activity. using our structure and assay, we identify an lplat thioesterase activity, and we provide experimental evidence to support an ordered-binding and ""reset"" mechanistic model for lpxm function. this work enables the interrogation of other bacterial acyltransferases' structure-mechanism relationships, and the assay described herein provides a foundation for quantitatively characterizing the enzymology of any number of clinically relevant lplat proteins.
computer-aided_design	a review is provided on efforts in our laboratory over the last decade to discover anti-hiv agents. the work has focused on computer-aided design and synthesis of non-nucleoside inhibitors of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase (nnrtis) with collaborative efforts on biological assaying and protein crystallography. numerous design issues were successfully addressed including the need for potency against a wide range of viral variants, good aqueous solubility, and avoidance of electrophilic substructures. computational methods including docking, de novo design, and free-energy perturbation (fep) calculations made essential contributions. the result is novel nnrtis with picomolar and low-nanomolar activities against wild type hiv-1 and key variants that also show much improved solubility and lower cytotoxicity than recently approved drugs in the class.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: although fibrosis seems to be prognostic for adverse outcomes in adults with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (idc), little is known about the prevalence and development of fibrosis in pediatric idc hearts. we hypothesized that there is less activation of fibrosis at a molecular level in pediatric idc hearts than in failing adult hearts. methods and results: pediatric hearts were analyzed histologically to determine the prevalence of fibrosis. left ventricular tissue from adult and pediatric idc hearts and adult and pediatric nonfailing (nf) hearts were subjected to quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to study the expression of important mrnas that affect fibrosis. we found age-specific differences between idc and nf hearts in the regulation of noncoding galectin-3, corin, matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) 2, mmp-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp) 2, and timp-3. we also found markers that were similarly altered in both adult and pediatric idc hearts (interleukin-1 receptor like 1 receptor, timp-1, and timp-4). finally, micrornas 29a-c were significantly decreased in the pediatric idc patients. conclusions: pediatric idc patients demonstrate age-specific differences in the molecular pathways implicated in fibrosis in the adult heart. at the ultrastructural level the unique gene expression pattern appears to limit fibrosis in the failing pediatric heart.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: to enhance survival and generation of definitive endoderm cells from human embryonic stem cells in a simple and reproducible system. main methods: definitive endoderm (de) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hescs) was induced under a chemical-defined condition withdrawn insulin supplement and serum albumin. we dissected influence of ""alternative growth factors"", wnt3a, bmp4 and bfgf in activin a-driven differentiation by detection of de-associated genes expression and cell viability. expression of de-associated sox17 and foxa2 genes was analyzed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and western blot assays. quantitative evaluation of de efficiency was performed by flow cytometry analysis of cxcr4-expressed cell population. cell viability during de differentiation was analyzed by an annexin v/pi double staining test. key findings: supplementation with wnt3a, bmp4 or bfgf promoted de generation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. cell apoptosis elicited by activin a was significantly ameliorated by a cocktail with wnt3a, bmp4 and bfgf. this allowed for sustained cell viability without insulin-containing supplements, thereby indirectly improving the efficiency of de generation. therefore, the cocktail containing is optimal for efficient de generation in the presence of activin a and an insulin/albumin-free condition. significance: this optimal condition facilitates the balance between the productivity and the viability maintenance, and could be valuable for mass production of de with minimal variation.

computer-aided_design	three-dimensional point cloud registration is important in reverse engineering. in this paper, we propose a registration method for large-scale 3d point clouds, which is based on neighborhood constraints of geometrical features. the method consists of initial and exact registration steps.in the process of initial registration, we define a new functon that measures feature similarity by calculating the distance function, and in the process of exact registration, we introduce the angle information that improve the accuracy of iterative closest point algorithm. compared with the traditional feature-based and iterative closest point algorithms, our method significantly reduced the registration time by 11.9 % and has only 1 % of the registration error of the traditional feature-based algorithm. the proposed algorithm can be used to create efficient 3d models for virtual plant reconstruction and computer-aided design, and the registration results can provide a reference for virtual plant reconstruction and growth.
manufacturing_engineering	the purpose of this study is to develop a new method for designing compression sportswear from the viewpoint of force by simulation. applied simulation techniques are 1) skin strain simulation, 2) fabric strain simulation using the anisotropic hyperelastic model, and 3) musculoskeletal simulation. for skin strain simulations, a three dimensional computer graphic (3d-cg) polygon strain was calculated as a skin strain using a 3d-cg model that simulates the human body (cg-human-model). the initial strain and the strain caused by physical exercise were given to the polygon model representing the shape of the sportswear (cg-sportswear-model). for compression sportswear, the strain of the fabric is approximately the same as skin strain, thus the strain of the cg-human-model was given to the cg-sportswear-model. in-plane and out-of-plane forces resulting from the cg-sportswear-model are calculated using anisotropic hyperelastic models. these forces were given to the musculoskeletal simulation as the external forces, and muscle activity required for any given physical exercise (e. g. swimming motion) was calculated. information of forces and muscle activity are very useful in designing compression sportswear. it is believed that this new method for designing compression sportswear based on simulation is a sophisticated technique because this method takes into account not only forces resulting from sportswear but also the effect of these forces on physical exercise.

manufacturing_engineering	the future world of micro and nano dimensions is leading to the generation of a whole new range of products, particularly engineered medical and healthcare diagnostics, industrial, optical telecommunications aerospace applications and textiles. many current manufacturing processes are based on lithographic techniques that have traditionally driven silicon micro ic production but the new drive is for low cost, high precision products with greater functionality based on non-silicon materials such as polymers, ceramics, glass and metals. machining micro and nano structures in non-silicon materials requires new process technologies and these are being developed at new facilities at the manufacturing engineering centre at cardiff university. known as microbridge, the facilities provide an open access micro and nano engineering and manufacturing service to uk industry. this provides a suite of equipment and facilities based on a focused ion beam milling machine, a picosecond laser ablation system and nano imprinting lithograph and which complement an already established range of micro machining equipment.
enzymology	in this study, we investigated the possibility of reversed micelles, widely used as an enzyme reactor for lipases, for the determination of lipoxygenase activity. although it is rapid and simple, reversed micelles have some limitations, such as interference by uv-absorbing materials and surfactant. lipoxygenase activity in the reversed micelles was determined by reading the absorbance of the lipid hydroperoxidation product (conjugated diene) at 234 nm. among surfactants and organic media, aot and isooctane were most effective for the dioxygenation of linoleic acid in reversed micelles. the strong absorbance of aot in the uv region is a major obstacle for the direct application of the aot/isooctane reversed micelles to lipoxygenase activity determination. to prevent interference by aot, we added an aot removal step in the procedure for lipoxygenase activity determination in reversed micelles. the lipoxygenase activity was dependent on water content, and maximum activity was obtained at an r-value of 10.

internal_combustion_engine	a semiempirical reciprocating compressor model was developed to characterize the time response of the pressure within a compressed-natural-gas storage tank. the model assumes isentropic compression in the single-stage compressor that feeds into an isothermal reservoir, i.e. compression heat was assumed to dissipate between the cylinder and the tank. this low-order model utilizes a few key variables such as the compression ratio, the cylinder volume, the tank volume, and the engine speed and yields a reasonable approximation for the pressure inside a tank over time. the natural-gas compressor used to validate the model is a unique automotive internal-combustion engine that was heavily modified to have two distinct modes. in one mode, all engine cylinders fire normally providing locomotion for a natural-gas vehicle. in the other mode, one cylinder of the engine is used to compress low-pressure residential natural gas, in multiple stages, to a standard us compressed-natural-gas vehicle storage tank pressure of 248 bar (3600 lb/in(2) gauge). it was found that the first-order response model closely matches the trend in the tank pressure over time seen in laboratory experiments, with a typical error of less than 5%.
strength_of_materials	the microstructures of metallic materials become extremely refined and their mechanical strengths exhibit considerable anisotropy when subjected to severe plastic deformation by equal channel angular pressing (ecap). the small punch (sp) testing method was employed as a substitute for the standard tension test to assess the anisotropic tensile strength of materials produced by ecap. sp testing is a viable alternative to standard tension tests because ecap samples are usually limited to approximately 10 mm in length in the transverse direction perpendicular to the extrusion (longitudinal) direction of the ecap process and the dimensions of the sp test specimen are 10 mm x 10 mm x 0.5 mm. the sp tests were performed using specimens of over-aged aluminum 2024 alloy subjected to three ecap passes at 150 degrees c and extracted by wire cutting along the longitudinal and transverse axes. the failure surfaces of sp specimens after testing showed that failure was caused by shear deformation and that ecap-processed materials displayed anisotropic strength. based on these results, a method is proposed to assess tensile strength along both the transverse and the longitudinal axes of ecap materials exhibiting anisotropic strength. the validity of the proposed method was verified through a comparison of its performance evaluating plastic flow strength with measurements obtained by tension tests along the longitudinal axis.

enzymology	metabolic modeling can suggest which is the key enzyme activity that needs to be controlled or its activity enhanced for the required production of a metabolite in a pathway. it also helps to find possible drug targets (enzymes to be inhibited). in metabolic modeling, knowing the kinetics of the enzymes involved in a pathway is mandatory. most enzymatic reactions involve multi-substrates and follow an ordered sequential or ping-pong mechanism. the kinetic parameters involved in the model are obtained by fitting experimental data using a model based on the mechanism. the cleland model has been used for some years. the grouping of parameters, such as dissociation constant and michaelis-menten constant, makes the strategy meaningful and hence the cleland model is still in use. although other alternate methods, e.g., the king-altman method, are available, derivation by determinants can be used to derive a rate expression for the sequential or ping-pong mechanism, they are tedious. hence, a meaningful modification is suggested in this communication for deriving the enzyme mechanism which is based on thilakavathi et al. (biotech lett 28:1889-1894, 2006) to obtain the cleland model in an easier way.
northern_blotting	the emergence of small rnas as key and potent regulators of gene expression has prompted the need for robust detection and assay protocols to be developed for investigating their generation and tissue distribution. the physicochemical nature of these rnas allows traditional assay methods to be employed; however, due to the relatively small size of endo-sirnas, key changes to these protocols are required. here, we present a method for the nonradioactive detection of endo-sirnas in mouse tissue and microinjected xenopus oocytes. the method comprises steps for rna extraction, page, and low-stringency northern blotting using dig-labelled rna probes. moreover, it includes a strategy to design and generate cheap hybridization probes with greatly increased sensitivity. these methods may be used as a simple and robust protocol for nonradioactive detection of small rnas or be combined with other strategies to potentially enhance signal intensity.
enzymology	two valid targets for antibiotic development, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (hppk) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), catalyze consecutive reactions in folate biosynthesis. in francisella tularensis (ft), these two activities are contained in a single protein, fthppk-dhps. although pemble et al. (plos one 5, e14165) determined the structure of fthppk-dhps, they were unable to measure the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. in this study, we elucidated the binding and inhibitory activities of two hppk inhibitors (hp-18 and hp-26) against fthppk-dhps, determined the structure of fthppk-dhps in complex with hp-26, and measured the kinetic parameters for the dual enzymatic activities of fthppk-dhps. the biochemical analyses showed that hp-18 and hp-26 have significant isozyme selectivity, and that fthppk-dhps is unique in that the catalytic efficiency of its dhps activity is only 1/260,000 of that of escherichia coli dhps. sequence and structural analyses suggest that hp-26 is an excellent lead for developing therapeutic agents for tularemia, and that the very low dhps activity is due, at least in part, to the lack of a key residue that interacts with the substrate p-aminobenzoic acid (paba). a blast search of the genomes of ten f. tularensis strains indicated that the bacterium contains a single fthppk-dhps. the marginal dhps activity and the single copy existence of fthppk-dhps in f. tularensis make this bacterium more vulnerable to dhps inhibitors. current sulfa drugs are ineffective against tularemia; new inhibitors targeting the unique paba-binding pocket may be effective and less subject to resistance because any mutations introducing resistance may make the marginal dhps activity unable to support the growth of f. tularensis.
human_metabolism	flavonoids are biologically active compounds in food with potential health effects. we have used the caco-2 cell monolayer model to study the absorption and metabolism of two flavonols, a class of flavonoids, specifically kaempferol and galangin. metabolism experiments allowed identification of five kaempferol conjugates: 3-, 7- and 4'-glucuronide, a sulphate and a glucurono-sulphate; and four galangin conjugates: 3-, 5- and 7-glucuronides, and a sulphate, using specific enzyme hydrolysis, hplc-ms, and hplc with post-column metal complexation/tandem ms. transport studies showed that the flavonols were conjugated inside the cells then transported across the monolayer or effluxed back to the apical side. sulphated conjugates were preferentially effluxed back to the apical side, whereas glucuronides were mostly transported to the basolateral side. for kaempferol, a small amount of the unconjugated aglycone permeated in both directions, indicating some passive diffusion. when kaempferol-3-glucuronide and quercetin 7-sulphate were applied to either side of the cells, no permeation in either direction was observed, indicating that conjugates cannot re-cross the cell monolayer. formation of apical kaempferol-7- and 4'-glucuronides was readily saturated, whereas formation of other conjugates at the apical side and all at the basolateral side increased with increasing concentration of kaempferol, implying different transporters are responsible at the apical and basolateral sides. the results highlight the important but complex metabolic changes occurring in flavonoids during absorption.

enzymology	the radical s-adenosyl-l-methionine enzyme desii from streptomyces venezuelae is able to oxidize the c3 hydroxyl group of tdp-d-quinovose to the corresponding ketone via an alpha-hydroxyalkyl radical intermediate. it is unknown whether electron transfer from the radical intermediate precedes or follows its deprotonation, and answering this question would offer considerable insight into the mechanism by which the small but important class of radical-mediated alcohol dehydrogenases operate. this question can be addressed by measuring steady-state kinetic isotope effects (kies); however, their interpretation is obfuscated by the degree to which the steps of interest limit catalysis. to circumvent this problem, we measured the solvent deuterium kie on the saturating steady-state concentration of the radical intermediate using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. the resulting value, 0.22 +/- 0.03, when combined with the solvent deuterium kie on the maximum rate of turnover (v) of 1.8 +/- 0.2, yielded a kie of 8 +/- 2 on the net rate constant specifically associated with the alpha-hydroxyalkyl radical intermediate. this result implies that electron transfer from the radical intermediate does not precede deprotonation. further analysis of these isotope effects, along with the ph dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters, likewise suggests that desii must be in the correct protonation state for initial generation of the alpha-hydroxyalkyl radical. in addition to providing unique mechanistic insights, this work introduces a unique approach to investigating enzymatic reactions using kies.
enzymology	laccases are a promising candidate for crosslinking milk proteins in stirred fermented milks. it was applied in a post-processing step due to its acidic ph optimum reported in literature for rebodying of the gel and an improvement in structure. a laccase preparation from trametes versicolor had a lower oxidation activity in ultrafiltration permeate than in model buffer systems, and a ph optimum of 4.5. it was applied to stirred skim milk gels but no significant change in the storage modulus or apparent viscosity of yoghurt occurred. confocal laser scanning micrographs showed a more porous structure of the milk gel. some fresh cheese samples had improved rheological properties. a competing crosslinking activity and peptidolytic activity was assumed and smaller peptides were detected in acidified milk by fluorescence. mass spectrometry of the laccase preparation returned mainly laccase sequences. although this does not exclude proteases, it indicates that the radical mechanism of laccases may lead to protein degradation. industrial relevance: enzymatic modification of milk proteins can alter the structure of fermented milk gels and even create new structures. rheological properties can be improved via crosslinking, thus reducing costs due to the addition of protein powders or stabilisers. an innovative approach to combining biotechnology and food science and engineering is investigated. the study is interesting for both enzyme manufacturers and dairy companies as it aims to at least partially fill the knowledge gap between enzymology and their real-world application in dairy products. however, enzymatic treatment is an additional step and also incurs costs which should be taken into account.

immunology	interleukin-7 (il-7) is a cytokine that has been known since long in immunology, mainly regarding its effects on t-cells and b-cells. il-7 has been demonstrated to be necessary for both b-cell and t-cell proliferation and lack of il-7 causes immature immune cell arrest. interestingly, in recent years, certain studies have strongly suggested that the role of il-7 is far beyond the field of immunology, it might have direct or indirect effect on cancer. this review aims to summarize the role of il-7 in immunity and its role in the pathogenesis of neoplasia.
southern_blotting	telomeres at the ends of human chromosomes consist of tandem hexametric (ttaggg)n repeats, which protect them from degradation. at each cycle of cell division, most normal somatic cells lose approximately 50-100 bp of the terminal telomeric repeat dna. precise prediction of growth and estimation of the malignant potential of brain tumors require additional markers. dna extraction was performed from the 51 frozen tissues, and a non-radioactive chemiluminescent assay was used for southern blotting. one sample t-test shows highly significant difference in telomere length in meningioma and astrocytoma with normal range. according to our results, higher grades of meningioma and astrocytoma tumors show more heterogeneity in telomere length, and also it seems shortening process of telomeres is an early event in brain tumors.
hydraulics	in the present work, hydrodynamics and mass-transfer performance of vapor-liquid flow of orthogonal wave tray (owt) column was studied. dry pressure drop, operating range (capacity graph) and overall column efficiency of owt column were investigated using pilot columns. a three-dimensional cfd model was developed within the two-phase eulerian framework to have an insight into the two-phase flow and mass-transfer behavior of owt. the simulated results were compared with experimental data and showed a good agreement. hydrodynamic and mass-transfer behaviors were revealed with the aid of velocity profiles, streamlines, interfacial area density distribution and so on. the effects of vapor/liquid load (f-s factor) on the murphree tray efficiency were also studied. the simulations of owt with different waves showed that the pressure drop, clear liquid height, froth height and murphree tray efficiency increase with the increase of slope, and owt with middle slope tended to have more uniform foam layer. comparison of the liquid-phase component velocity between owt and ripple shows that owt has better performance in froth layer distribution and stability. the mass-transfer data showed that owt not only had almost the same ""peak efficiency"" as sieve tray, but also had higher capacity and stability, it was suitable for capacity expansion.

northern_blotting	piwi-interacting rnas (pirna) are fully modified by 2'-o -methylation at their 3'-termini. this terminal methylation is required to prevent 3'-nucleotide addition, which serves as a tag for destabilization. in this chapter, we describe biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses of 2'-o -methylation at 3'-termini of pirnas.
machine_design	this paper presents an integrated error propagation analysis method to estimate the measurement uncertainty using monte carlo method in order to analyze the measurement accuracy of an h-drive stage with air bearing during high acceleration subjected to the influence of a variety of errors, including straightness errors, thermal errors, deformation errors and air bearing gap change errors caused by acceleration force. firstly, the integrated error propagation model of an h-drive stage is built combined with the effects of the various error sources based on the multi-body system and instrument precision theory. then these errors are identified by experiments and finite element analysis and the influence of each error in six degrees of freedom displacement is obtained. finally, the displacement measurement uncertainty of the stage in the reference coordinate system is evaluated by monte carlo method, within 95% probability, the displacement measurement results and the expanded uncertainty in x and y directions are calculated x=(165.000 +/- 0.064) mm and y=(195.000 +/- 0.054) mm respectively. the proposed method can be used in the error budget of precise machine design and applied in error compensation to improve the measurement and control accuracy of precise machine workpiece stage.

internal_combustion_engine	concerns with environmental impacts of urban mobility have led to the development of alternative solutions, such as battery electric vehicles (bev), highly applicable to certain sectors namely in urban logistics, since bev powertrain characteristics are extremely suited for urban driving context. this research work evaluates the adequacy of bev in urban logistics in lisbon, based on a real-world application. vehicle second-by-second data was collected during regular operation of both the internal combustion engine vehicle (icev) and the bev (for 7 and 3 months respectively). the results demonstrate that bev allows maintaining the same operation patterns, regarding the number of kilometers travelled per day (60 km), recharging time (6 h), and vehicle dynamics (average speed of 16 km/h for icev and 19 km/h for bev). when comparing the energy impacts of shifting to electric mobility, the bev allows reducing vehicle usage energy consumption by 76% and by 57% when considering the energy production stage. the logistics operations performance was not affected by the vehicle technology shift, since the operational requirements of the service were maintained and no issues on electric autonomy and recharging periods were observed, confirming the suitability of this vehicle technology for specific urban logistics applications.

thermodynamics	the hydrophobic drug lamotrigine (ltg) shows low bioavailability after oral administration. work has been performed to improve the aqueous solubility of ltg using the micelles of amphiphilic block copolymers. polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide triblock copolymers (peo-ppo-peo), known as pluronic((r)), have been the subject of current interest due to the versatile structural possibilities of varying peo/ppo ratios. incorporation of ltg in the aqueous micellar solutions of pluronic((r)) f127 was investigated using uv-visible spectroscopy. the shapes and size of the micelles with and without ltg have been ascertained using dynamic light scattering and small angle neutron scattering experiments. results show increase in the pluronic((r)) micellar size with hard sphere radius with the incorporation of ltg. the effect of hydrophilic polymers (peg1500 and f68) on the ltg-incorporated pluronic((r)) f127 micelles was also studied and found inefficient for enhancement of the solubility of ltg. solid forms of ltg-incorporated pluronic((r)) f127 micelles with and without hydrophilic polymers, coded as lpms, were successfully prepared through the thin-film hydration method. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis have been used to ensure the compatibility of the ltg with pluronic((r)) f127 micelles in prepared lpms. all the lpms showed good incorporation efficiency, loading capacity and the sustained release profile of ltg. results showed no specific improvement with the addition of hydrophilic polymers in the studied concentration range.
northern_blotting	the arabidopsis vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter gene, atnhx1, was introduced into soybean by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. four independent kanamycin resistant lines were obtained. the result of pcr, southern blotting and northern blotting analyses demonstrated that the atnhx1 gene was successfully inserted into the soybean genome and stably expressed in these kanamycin resistant lines. the stability of atnhx1 expression and salt resistance were evaluated in the soybean transformants for over 6 generations. two independently derived transgenic lines with high expression level of atnhx1 were selected, and propagated to generation t-5 in the absence of selection pressure. pcr and rt-pcr examinations revealed that atnhx1 was highly expressed in all investigated transgenic t-5 progenies. furthermore, all transgenic t-5 plants showed resistant to salt stress, same as those of homozygous t-2 plants. taken together, our results indicated that constitutive expression of atnhx1 enhanced salt tolerance in soybean for over 6 generations, suggesting a great potential use of atnhx1 for improving salt tolerance in plants by genetic engineering.
molecular_biology	we explore the integration of societal issues in undergraduate training within the life sciences. skills in thinking about science, scientific knowledge production and the place of science in society are crucial in the context of the idea of responsible research and innovation. this idea became institutionalized and it is currently well-present in the scientific agenda. developing abilities in this regard seems particularly relevant to training in the life sciences, as new developments in this area somehow evoke the involvement of all of us citizens, our engagement to debate and take part in processes of change. the present analysis draws from the implementation of a curricular unit focused on science-society dialogue, an optional course included in the biochemistry degree study plan offered at the university of porto. this curricular unit was designed to be mostly an exploratory activity for the students, enabling them to undertake in-depth study in areas/topics of their specific interest. mapping topics from students' final papers provided a means of analysis and became a useful tool in the exploratory collaborative construction of the course. we discuss both the relevance and the opportunity of thinking and questioning the science-society dialogue. as part of undergraduate training, this pedagogical practice was deemed successful.

molecular_biology	the ability to engineer cells to express a protein of interest in an inducible manner and stably for a long period is a valuable tool in molecular biology and also one that holds promise for regenerative medicine in the future. ccn proteins have been suggested to be involved in tissue regeneration. in this chapter, we describe an in vitro method for stable and inducible expression of ccn protein in a chondroprogenitor cell line and in chondrocytes in primary culture that does not involve the use of any viral vector.
strength_of_materials	in this work, a model to simulate the superelastic response for shape memory alloy wires and springs subjected to torsional loading is constructed by combining thermodynamics principles along with preisach models. following doraiswamy et al. (2011), a gibbs potential based formulation is employed to separate the thermoelastic response of the shape memory alloys from its dissipative response. the dissipative part is then modeled with a discrete preisach approach. rather than beginning with a full three dimensional model and solving for non-homogeneous shear stresses across the specimen cross-section, a ""strength of materials"" approach that can directly model the torsional response using experimentally measurable quantities such as torque and angle of twist is developed. the model results are verified with experiments performed on shape memory alloy springs at three different temperatures. the model is also used to predict torsion response of shape memory alloy wires at different twists and temperatures using experimental results for only one twist or temperature case respectively. the torsional response for three different wire diameters were predicted using experimental data for one diameter case.

enzymology	n-terminal acetylation (nta) is one of the most abundant protein modifications known, and the n-terminal acetyltransferase (nat) machinery is conserved throughout all eukarya. over the past 50 years, the function of nta has begun to be slowly elucidated, and this includes the modulation of protein protein interaction, protein-stability, protein function, and protein targeting to specific cellular compartments. many of these functions have been studied in the context of naa10/nata; however, we are only starting to really understand the full complexity of this picture. roughly, about 40% of all human proteins are substrates of naa10 and the impact of this modification has only been studied for a few of them. besides acting as a nat in the nata complex, recently other functions have been linked to naa10, including post-translational nta, lysine acetylation, and nat/kat-independent functions. also, recent publications have linked mutations in naa10 to various diseases, emphasizing the importance of naa10 research in humans. the recent design and synthesis of the first bisubstrate inhibitors that potently and selectively inhibit the nata/naa10 complex, monomeric naa10, and hnaa50 further increases the toolset to analyze naa10 function.

southern_blotting	dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (dfr) catalyzes the reduction of dihydroflavonols in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. in this study, we obtained the full-length cdna of dfr from calibrachoa hybrida, cadfr, through race-based technique. the cdna of cadfr is 1,351 bp with an open reading frame of 1, 152 bp, which encodes a putative protein of 383 amino acids. the cadfr protein is predicted with 42.74 kd in molecular weight and a pi value of 5.83. sequence alignment showed that cadfr had close relationship with dfrs from other species of the solanaceae family, and it belonged to the asp-type. we constructed 35s::cadfr overexpression vector and transformed it into three cultivars of petunia hybrida using the agrobacterium-mediated method. multiple transformants were selected in the presence of 50 mg/l kanamycin antibiotic and further verified by polymerase chain reaction and southern blotting analyses. we observed that the bud and flower color of transgenic petunia altered comparing with that of control plants. the dfr activities varied in most color-changed transgenic petunias. these results confirm the identity and function of cadfr and further suggest that integration of the cadfr can be used to change flower color of transgenic plants.

southern_blotting	chlorophyll biosynthesis is catalyzed by two multi subunit enzymes; a light-dependent and a light-independent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase. the light-independent enzyme consists of three subunits (chll, chln and chlb) in photosynthetic bacteria and plastids in which the chlb gene encodes the major subunit that catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide. we report here stable integration of the chlb gene from pinus thunbergii into the chloroplast genome of tobacco. using helium-driven biolistic gun, transplastomic clones were developed in vitro. the stable integration and homoplasmy for transgenes was confirmed by using pcr and southern blotting techniques. nodal cuttings of the homoplasmic transgenic and untransformed wild type shoots were cultured on ms medium in the dark. as expected, shoots developed from the cuttings of the wild type plants in the dark showed etiolated growth with no roots whereas shoots from the cuttings of the transgenic plants developed early and more roots. upon shifting from dark to light in growth room, leaves of the transgenic shoots showed early development of chlorophyll pigments compared to the wild type shoots. further, photosynthetically indistinguishable transgenic shoots also showed significant difference in root development from untransformed wild type shoots when cuttings were grown in the light. therefore, it may be concluded that the chlb gene is involved, directly or indirectly, in the root development of tobacco. further, the gene promotes early development of chlorophyll pigments, upon illumination from dark, in addition to its role in the light-independent chlorophyll formation when expressed together with subunits l&n in other organisms.
internal_combustion_engine	the internal combustion engine (ice) does not efficiently convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. a majority of this energy is dissipated as heat in the exhaust and coolant. rather than directly improving the efficiency of the engine, efforts are being made to improve the efficiency of the engine indirectly by using a waste heat recovery system. two promising technologies that were found to be useful for this purpose were thermoelectric generators (tegs) and heat pipes. both tegs and heat pipes are solid state, passive, silent, scalable and durable. the use of heat pipes can potentially reduce the thermal resistance and pressure losses in the system as well as temperature regulation of the tegs and increased design flexibility. tegs do have limitations such as low temperature limits and relatively low efficiency. heat pipes do have limitations such as maximum rates of heat transfer and temperature limits. when used in conjunction, these technologies have the potential to create a completely solid state and passive waste heat recovery system.

immunology	the concept of functional neutrophil subsets is new and their clinical significance in malignancies is unknown. our study investigated the role of cd16(dim) cd62l(high), cd16(high) cd62l(high) and cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subsets in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) patients. these neutrophil subsets may play different roles in immune-related activity in cancer, based on their profile, activation state and migration ability within a tumor site, which may be important in predicting cancer prognoses. tumor biopsies and blood were obtained from newly diagnosed untreated hnscc patients and healthy controls. neutrophil subsets and their phenotype were characterized using flow cytometry. isolated granulocytes were assessed for anti-tumor immune functions. compared to controls hnscc patients exhibited increased cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils in blood; this subset displayed a distinct phenotypes with high expression of cd11b and cd18. this subset was prone to migrate into the tumor facilitated by tumor-derived il-8. furthermore, il-8 was also found to activate neutrophils and thereby promoting subset transition. various assays demonstrated that activated cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils inhibited migration, proliferation and induced apoptosis of fadu cancer cells. neutrophil elastase detected in activated cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils and tumor biopsies suggested that cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils impart anti-tumoral activity via neutrophil extracellular traps. furthermore, increased fraction of cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils was shown to correlate with an increased survival rate. our study demonstrates the clinical relevance of the cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subset, providing evidence for its increased migration capacity, its anti-tumor activity including increased net formation and finally its correlation with increased survival in hnscc patients. what 's new? evidence is growing for distinct neutrophil subsets with diverse roles in cancer immunology, but a clinical link remains to be established. our study demonstrates the clinical relevance of the cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subset in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). patients harbored an increased fraction of anti-tumorigenic cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils in the circulation compared to healthy controls. the subset had an enhanced capacity to elicit neutrophil extracellular traps (nets) extrusion, and an increased fraction of cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils in the circulation correlated with increased survival. the findings demonstrate an anti-tumoral role of the cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subset in hnscc.
molecular_biology	background: representatives of the trematode family fasciolidae are responsible for major socio-economic losses worldwide. fascioloides magna is an important pathogenic liver fluke of wild and domestic ungulates. to date, only a limited number of studies concerning the molecular biology of f. magna exist. therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence of f. magna, and assess the phylogenetic relationships of this fluke with other trematodes based on the mtdna dataset. findings: the complete f. magna mt genome sequence is 14,047 bp. the gene content and arrangement of the f. magna mt genome is similar to those of fasciola spp., except that trne is located between trng and the only non-coding region in f. magna mt genome. phylogenetic relationships of f. magna with selected trematodes using bayesian inference (bi) was reconstructed based on the concatenated amino acid sequences for 12 protein-coding genes, which confirmed that the genus fascioloides is closely related to the genus fasciola; the intergeneric differences of amino acid composition between the genera fascioloides and fasciola ranged 17.97-18.24 %. conclusions: the determination of f. magna mt genome sequence provides a valuable resource for further investigations of the phylogeny of the family fasciolidae and other trematodes, and represents a useful platform for designing appropriate molecular markers.
computer-aided_design	introduction: combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) has not allowed the cure of hiv. the main obstacle to hiv eradication is the existence of quiescent reservoirs. several other limitations of cart have been described, such as strict life-long treatment and high costs, restricting it to western countries, as well as the development of multidrug resistance. given these limitations and the impetus to find a cure, the development of new treatments is necessary.areas covered: in this review, we discuss the current status of several efficient molecules able to suppress hiv gene transcription, including nf-kb and tat inhibitors. we also assess the potential of new proteins belonging to the intriguing ding family, which have been reported to have potential anti-hiv-1 activity by inhibiting hiv gene transcription.expert opinion: targeting hiv-1 gene transcription is an alternative approach, which could overcome cart-related issues, such as the emergence of multidrug resistance. improving cart will rely on the identification and characterization of new actors inhibiting hiv-1 transcription. combining such efforts with the use of new technologies, the development of new models for preclinical studies, and improvement in drug delivery will considerably reduce drug toxicity and thus increase patient adherence.
genetics	a black fly species of the simulium feuerborni species-group of simulium (nevermannia) from cameron highland, peninsular malaysia, previously regarded as s. feuerborni edwards, originally described from east java, is described as simulium pairoti sp. nov. based on complete life stages. high intraspecific variations in the arrangement of the six pupal gill filaments, length of the stalk of the ventral paired filaments, and length of the anterodorsal projection of the cocoon, are noted in this species. this new species is readily distinguished from its congeners by having the characters of male genitalia with simple lamellate ventral plate, short inwardly-twisted styles, several parameral hooks, and a simple narrow median sclerite. morphological data reported herein plus the chromosomal and molecular data presented elsewhere support s. pairoti as a novel pseudocryptic species.

cell_biology	primary immunodeficiencies (pids) are a group of rare genetic diseases resulting in the impairment of one or more functions of the human immune system. common variable immunodeficiency (cvid) is one of the most prevalent pids, yet despite extensive genetic analysis, most patients do not have a monogenetic diagnosis. this has led to the theory that cvid must be a polygenetic condition. an alternative theory to a monogenetic or polygenetic underlying cause of cvid is that it is epigenetic phenomena that are causal in the majority of cvid patients. i will briefly discuss epigenetic regulation in b-cell biology and development, current examples of epigenetic diseases causing cvid-like primary antibody deficiencies, and how these observations may guide future investigation into the role of epigenetics in cvid.
molecular_biology	background: structural alignment of proteins is one of the most challenging problems in molecular biology. the tertiary structure of a protein strictly correlates with its function and computationally predicted structures are nowadays a main premise for understanding the latter. however, computationally derived 3d models often exhibit deviations from the native structure. a way to confirm a model is a comparison with other structures. the structural alignment of a pair of proteins can be defined with the use of a concept of protein descriptors. the protein descriptors are local substructures of protein molecules, which allow us to divide the original problem into a set of subproblems and, consequently, to propose a more efficient algorithmic solution. in the literature, one can find many applications of the descriptors concept that prove its usefulness for insight into protein 3d structures, but the proposed approaches are presented rather from the biological perspective than from the computational or algorithmic point of view. efficient algorithms for identification and structural comparison of descriptors can become crucial components of methods for structural quality assessment as well as tertiary structure prediction. results: in this paper, we propose a new combinatorial model and new polynomial-time algorithms for the structural alignment of descriptors. the model is based on the maximum-size assignment problem, which we define here and prove that it can be solved in polynomial time. we demonstrate suitability of this approach by comparison with an exact backtracking algorithm. besides a simplification coming from the combinatorial modeling, both on the conceptual and complexity level, we gain with this approach high quality of obtained results, in terms of 3d alignment accuracy and processing efficiency. conclusions: all the proposed algorithms were developed and integrated in a computationally efficient tool descs-standalone, which allows the user to identify and structurally compare descriptors of biological molecules, such as proteins and rnas. both pdb (protein data bank) and mmcif (macromolecular crystallographic information file) formats are supported.
human_metabolism	a study was undertaken to determine if humans excrete both amobarbital n-glucuronides and n-glucosides in urine after an oral dose of amobarbital. amobarbital n-glucuronides were synthesized and characterized. a reverse phase lc method using past-column ph adjustment and uv detection at 240 nm was developed and used for the quantification of the amobarbital n-glucosides and n-glucuronides in human urine. amobarbital was administered orally to seven male subjects and the total urine was collected for a period of 48-53 h after dosing. after filtration, the urine was injected directly onto the hplc column to analyze for the presence of metabolites. the previously identified (5s)-amobarbital n-glucoside was detected in all seven subjects. the (5r)-amobarbital n-glucoside was detected at lower concentrations in only four of the subjects. at the levels at which amobarbital n-glucosides were detected, there was no evidence for the formation and excretion of the amobarbital n-glucuronides. amobarbital n-glucuronidation is not a quantitatively significant pathway for the biodisposition of amobarbital in humans.

northern_blotting	type vii collagen is the major component of anchoring fibrils in the epidermal basement membrane. its expression has been analyzed by immunostaining or northern blotting, but rarely at the protein level. in this study, we have quantitatively examined the effects of ascorbic acid and various cytokines/growth factors on the protein synthesis and secretion of type vii collagen by human dermal fibroblasts in culture, using a developed, highly sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay with two kinds of specific monoclonal antibodies against the non-collagenous domain-1. ascorbic acid and its derivative induced a twofold increase in type vii collagen synthesis, and markedly increased the secretion of type vii collagen into the medium when compared with the control culture. this effect was not influenced by the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta 1). the synthesis of type vii collagen was elevated by tgf-beta 1, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta, but not by tgf-alpha. thus, our data indicate that the synthesis and secretion of type vii collagen in human dermal fibroblasts are regulated by ascorbate and the enhancement of type vii collagen gene expression by cytokines/growth factors is accompanied with elevated production of type vii collagen at the protein level.
hydraulics	leaf mass per area (lma) is a primary plant functional trait that represents the cost of constructing a leaf. ultimately, plants modify lma by altering leaf thickness (lt), leaf dry matter content (ldmc), or both. while lma can be modified through both of these constituents, studies of lma have found that there is variation in whether lt or ldmc changes are responsible for lma-and the relationships change depending on the species or functional groups being compared. in this study, we used a phylogenetic framework to determine that evolutionary shifts in lma are driven by lt, and not ldmc, among 45 serengeti grass species. we considered two alternative hypotheses that could result in evolutionary correlation of lma on lt but not ldmc: either (1) lt is more labile than ldmc-and is therefore a less costly means to change lma or (2) ldmc is tightly coupled to a different dimension of leaf variation (e.g., leaf hydraulics), leaving lt as the source of variation in lma. lt was not more labile than ldmc, leading us to conclude that the evolution of lma has been shaped by lt because ldmc is responding to other demands on leaf physiology. we speculate that leaf hydraulics provide this constraint on ldmc. the decoupling of ldmc from lt may allow plants to better optimize resource allocation in ecosystems where gradients in light competition, herbivory, and aridity place competing demands on leaf economics.
enzymology	phosphonates are compounds that contain the chemically stable carbon-phosphorus (c-p) bond. they are widely distributed amongst more primitive life forms including many marine invertebrates and constitute a significant component of the dissolved organic phosphorus reservoir in the oceans. virtually all biogenic c-p compounds are synthesized by a pathway in which the key step is the intramolecular rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate. however c-p bond cleavage by degradative microorganisms is catalyzed by a number of enzymes c-p lyases, c-p hydrolases, and others of as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism. expression of some of the pathways of phosphonate catabolism is controlled by ambient levels of inorganic p (pi) but for others it is pi-independent. in this report we review the enzymology of c-p bond metabolism in bacteria, and also present the results of an in silico investigation of the distribution of the genes that encode the pathways responsible, in both bacterial genomes and in marine metagenomic libraries, and their likely modes of regulation. interrogation of currently available whole-genome bacterial sequences indicates that some 10% contain genes encoding putative pathways of phosphonate biosynthesis while similar to 40% encode one or more pathways of phosphonate catabolism. analysis of metagenomic data from the global ocean survey suggests that some 10 and 30%, respectively, of bacterial genomes across the sites sampled encode these pathways. catabolic routes involving phosphonoacetate hydrolase, c-p lyase(s), and an uncharacterized 2-aminoethylphosphonate degradative sequence were predominant, and it is likely that both substrate-inducible and pi-repressible mechanisms are involved in their regulation. the data we present indicate the likely importance of phosphonate-p in global biogeochemical p cycling, and by extension its role in marine productivity and in carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the oceans.
strength_of_materials	the nonlinear load-displacement and normal stress distribution in composite sandwich beams made of unidirectional carbon/epoxy facings and pvc foam cores under bending was studied. the carbon/epoxy after an initial linear response exhibits a stiffening nonlinearity in tension and a softening nonlinearity in compression with the longitudinal strength in tension higher than that in compression. the foam core also presents a nonlinear stress-strain response. it was obtained that the load-displacement behaviour of the beam, after an initial linear part, is not linear. this behavior was modeled by an incremental strength of materials nonlinear analysis. the theoretical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results. furthermore, it was obtained that the neutral axis of sandwich beams under bending does not pass through the centroid of the cross section, but is displaced toward the tensile side of the beam. experimental results by moire measurements of the in-plane horizontal displacements of the core material corroborated the analytical predictions. these findings imply higher compressive and smaller tensile stresses in the core, than those predicted for facings with identical stress-strain behaviour in tension and compression, and should be taking into consideration in the failure analysis of sandwich beams.
computer-aided_design	the 2-d analytical solution of electrostatic potential and enhanced drain current is modeled for a dual metal surround gate junctionless transistor (dmsgjlt) by solving the poisson equation using the parabolic approximation technique. the gate engineered dmsgjlt produces an increase in the mobility of electrons in the channel. enhancement in drain current of 35 mu a is obtained than single metal jlt for the same dimension. due to that, the gain increases, short channel effects and leakage current decreases. the electrostatic potential, threshold voltage, drain current, transconductance, drain-induced barrier lowering, power and delay predicted by the analytical solution have excellent agreement with the simulation results obtained from technology computer-aided design. the analytical modeling provides useful insight on physics of short channel effects. the inverter circuit is implemented with a dmsgjlt and is compared with that of a single metal device. the noise margin analysis is made for the inverter circuit employing both dual metal and single metal devices. it is found that gate engineering improves the noise margin to a much extend and due to this, the voltage loss is also improved with a dmsgjlt.
immunology	canine leishmaniosis (canl) is caused by the parasite leishmania infantum and is a systemic disease, which can present with variable clinical signs, and clinicopathological abnormalities. clinical manifestations can range from subclinical infection to very severe systemic disease. leishmaniosis is categorized as a neglected tropical disease and the complex immune responses associated with leishmania species makes therapeutic treatments and vaccine development challenging for both dogs and humans. in this review, we summarize innate and adaptive immune responses associated with l. infantum infection in dogs, and we discuss the problems associated with the disease as well as potential solutions and the future direction of required research to help control the parasite.
polymerase_chain_reaction	digital pcr (dpcr) is a powerful method for the absolute quantification and rare mutation detection of nucleic acids. however, the available dpcr platforms require either expensive instruments or complicated operation, which limit their extensive application. this paper describes a robust self-partition chip to perform dpcr in a very simple and inexpensive format. the chip is constructed by sandwiching a micromolded surfactant-doped pdms layer between two glass slides, containing 10,000 reaction compartments (0.785 nl each). the two simple strategies, ""glass-pdms-glass"" sandwich configuration and surfactant-doped surface modification, are used to enhance pcr compatibility and enable efficient amplification in the chip by minimizing water loss and nonspecific adsorption of protein. furthermore, powered by pre-degassing of its pdms substrate and an attached pdms slab, the chip autonomously loads and partitions sample into a high-density array of microwells for performing dpcr analysis. we evaluated the quantitative capabilities of the dpcr chip by measuring a ten-fold serial dilution of genomic dna from lung cancer cell line h1975. finally, we also demonstrate its feasibility in the accurate measurement of small copy number variations, which exhibited better accuracy than real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). such simple and low-cost platform promises to accelerate the widespread use of dpcr.

internal_combustion_engine	this research paper mainly deals with a comprehensive techno-economic modeling and multi objective optimization of a cchp system for residential application. an internal combustion engine (ice) proposed as the prime power and a combined organic rankine cycle (orc), ejector refrigeration cycle (erc), and domestic water heater (dwh) is considered to recover the wasted heat from the ice through exhaust gas and water jacket. their common working fluids namely r-134a, r-600, r-123, and r-11 are selected in this study. a comprehensive multi-objective optimization is applied to determine the optimal design parameters of the system. two major objective functions, exergy efficiency that should be maximized and total cost rate of the system to be minimized are considered while satisfying several reasonable constraints. the total cost rate as an objective function consists of purchase equipment costs, fuel cost, and environmental impact cost. diesel engine capacity, diesel engine part load, expander inlet pressure, expander extraction pressure, extraction ratio, condenser pressure, and evaporator pressure are selected as decision variables. a developed multi-objective genetic algorithm is used as an optimization tool with ability of better optimal results with less computer running time. it is observed that r-11 working fluid is a good candidate from both exergy efficiency and total cost rate point of view. to examine the effect of each decision variable on objective functions, a sensitivity analysis is performed. finally, the ability of the system is studied to meet the cooling, heating, and electricity demand of a detached house with a defined load in tehran.

northern_blotting	we have cloned a novel transcriptional repressor protein, termed simirp58, which has high homology to rp58. both simirp58 and rp58 belong to the poz domain and kruppel zn finger (pok) family of proteins. using the luciferase assay system, we found that simirp58 also has transcriptional repressor activity like rp58. northern blotting and quantitative rt-pcr showed that simirp58 was expressed in testes at the highest level. in situ hybridization of testes showed that simirp58 is expressed by spermatocytes in only a portion of the seminiferous tubules. in contrast, expression of rp58 by spermatocytes was ubiquitous in all seminiferous, tubules. using cos-7 cells, we observed that simirp58 was localized in the cytoplasm, which is in contrast to rp58 that was localized in the nucleus. interestingly, co-transfection with simirp58 and rp58 induced changes in the localization patterns of both proteins.

human_metabolism	it was proved in two independent experimental studies with the same group of 11 young sportsmen that creatine (cr) given as food supplement interfered with the metabolism of one- and two-carbon units. cr, given in one dose of 5 g daily during one month, induced reciprocal changes of muscle mass and body fat. these changes were characteristic of each of the four proband groups, into which the probands were divided on basis of the increased or decreased level of cr in urine, and the increased or decreased levels of folates and vitamin b-12 in blood. the comparison of results of short- and long-term cr supplementations showed that individual deviations found within the rank of each group are characteristic for each person under study. the changes of the level of thiodiglycolic acid in urine proved to be good markers for deviations from homeostasis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim to investigate the role of delta 133p53 isoform in nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b) inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc)-mediated growth inhibition of mkn45 gastric cancer cells. methods the growth rate of mkn45 cells after treatment with different concentrations of only pdtc or ptdc in combination with cisplatin was detected by the cck-8 assay. mrna expression levels of delta 133p53, p53 beta, and the nf-kappa b p65 subunit and p65 protein levels were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and immunofluorescence, respectively. growth of mkn45 cells was significantly inhibited by pdtc alone in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). moreover, the inhibitory effect of cisplatin was remarkably enhanced in a dose- dependent manner by co-treatment with pdtc (p < 0.01). results rt-pcr analysis revealed that mrna expression of p65 was curbed significantly in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with only pdtc (p < 0.01), and this suppressive effect was further enhanced when co-treated with cisplatin (p < 0.01). with respect to the other p53 isoforms, mrna level of delta 133p53 was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with only pdtc or ptdc in combination with cisplatin (p0.05). a similar tendency of change in p65 protein expression, as observed for the corresponding mrna, was detected by immunofluorescence analysis (p0.01). conclusion delta 133p53 isoform (not p53 beta) is required in pdtc-induced inhibition of mkn45 gastric cancer cells, indicating that disturbance in the cross-talk between p53 and nf-kappa b pathways is a promising target in pharmaceutical research for the development of treatment strategies for gastric cancer.
enzymology	wound age evaluation is one of the most challenging issues in forensic pathology. in the first minutes or hours, standard histological examination may not determine whether the wound was inflicted in the pre- or post-mortem period. while red blood cell infiltration is classically considered as a sign of vital reaction, several studies have shown that extravasation of blood cells may also occur after death and cannot be used as a reliable marker in the diagnosis of wound vitality. numerous studies about wound vitality are available in the literature. they have evaluated markers involved in coagulation or inflammation, using various methods such as enzymology, molecular biology or immunohistochemistry. in this update, we first introduce some methodological principles. then, we review the main studies available in the literature. immunohistochemistry seems to be the most valuable method, given its easy application and the possibility to analyse the localization of the molecules of interest. some markers are promising, such as cd15, tnf alpha, il-6, il-1b, tgf alpha or tgf beta 1. prior to their application in daily practice, these early results need to be confirmed with other studies, conducted by independent teams and integrating multiple controls. most notably, the antibodies have to be tested in numerous postmortem wounds. indeed, a critical risk of overexpression in post-mortem wounds is present. some promising markers have been later invalidated because of post-mortem false positivity. finally, optimal sensitivity and specificity values could probably be reached by combining several markers, validated by large groups of pre- and post-mortem wounds.
human_metabolism	the diurnal light cycle has a crucial influence on all life on earth. unfortunately, modern society has modified this life- governing cycle by stressing maximum production and by giving insufficient attention to the ecological balance and homeostasis of the human metabolism. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of exposure or lack of exposure to natural light in a rest/ activity rhythm on cortisol and melatonin levels, as well as on psychological variables in humans under natural conditions. this is a cross- sectional study. the subjects were allocated split into two groups according to their workspace ( 10 employees in the ""with window'' group and 10 in the ""without window'' group). all participants were women and wore anactigraph ( actiwatch 2, philips respironics), which measures activity and ambient light exposure, for seven days. concentrations of melatonin and cortisol were measured from the saliva samples. participants were instructed to collect saliva during the last day of use of the actigraph at 08: 00 am, 4: 00 pm and 10: 00 pm. the subjects answered the self- reporting questionnaire- 20 ( srq- 20) to measure the presence of minor psychiatric disorders; the montgomery- asberg ( ma) scale was used to measure depression symptoms, and the pittsburgh sleep quality index questionnaire ( psqi) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep. the rayleigh analysis indicates that the two groups, `` with window'' an d `` without window'', exhibited similar activities and light acrophases. in relation to light exposure, the mesor was significantly higher ( t 2.651, p 0.023) in t he `` with window'' group ( 191.04 133.36) than in the `` without window'' group ( 73.8 42.05). additionally, the `` with window'' group presented the highest amplitude of light exposure ( 298.07 222.97). cortisol levels were significantly different between the groups at 10: 00 pm ( t 3.009, p 0.008; `` without window'' ( 4.01 0.91) `` with window'' ( 3.10 0.30)). in terms of the melatonin levels, the groups differed at two different times of day: 08: 00 am ( t 2.593, p 0.018) and 10: 00 pm ( t 2.939, p 0.009). the `` with window'' group had a lower melatonin level at 08: 00 am ( 3.54 0.60) but a higher level at 10: 00 pm ( 24.74 4.22) than the `` without window'' group. higher cortisol levels were positively correlated with minor psychiatric disorders and depressive symptoms ( ma) at 10: 00 pm. lower melatonin levels at 10: 00 pm were correlated with depressive symptoms and poor quality of sleep ( psqi). our study demonstrated that not only may light pollution affect human physiology but also lack of exposure to natural light is related to high levels of cortisol and lower levels of melatonin at night, and these, in turn, are related to depressive symptoms and poor quality of sleep.
immunology	people living nowadays with hiv and aids may be treated effectively regarding virus replication and immunology. however, non-aids-defining cancer is of growing relevance due to high incidence and unfavorable outcome. the aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on gastrointestinal (gi) carcinoma. although literature on gi cancer is rare, an increased incidence of esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and colorectal carcinoma has been demonstrated. however, there are only few reports on therapy strategies and outcome, so that, despite increased occurrence of many gi carcinomas, only little is known about individualized treatment options and outcome in hiv-positive patients. more efforts have to be undertaken to close this gap.

genetics	the genetic structure of european mudminnow populations throughout the species range was examined using mitochondrial dna and seven microsatellite loci. ten mitochondrial haplotypes were detected, suggesting three phylogeographic lineages, which likely diverged during the early and middle pleistocene. these three lineages geographically correspond to three regions: the danube drainage including the drava system and dniester delta, the sava system and the tisza system. high genetic diversity observed using mtdna was confirmed with microsatellite data, suggesting the existence of 14 populations in the studied area. the isolation-with-migration model showed that migration rates between populations were generally low and were highest between the drava and its tributary mura. according to the inferred relative population splitting times, umbra krameri likely spread from the eastern part of the species range to the west, which also showed the highest genetic diversity and largest population size. as reported by the time-calibrated phylogeny, separation of the european and american umbra occurred roughly at the end of late cretaceous and in the first half of the paleogene (60.57 ma with 95% highest probability density of 39.57-81.75). taking these results into account, appropriate guidelines are proposed to conserve european mudminnow populations.
thermodynamics	gaseous helium is being considered as a cryogen for a variety of high-power density applications. it is capable of reaching operational temperature levels as low as 20 k. this paper presents a time efficient method of designing and modeling a high-temperature superconducting dc cable. the analysis is an extension of a previously presented mathematical model in which the volume element method was used to characterize the fluid flow and heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation through a flexible cable cryostat. a system of ordinary differential equations was formulated using the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. the computational domain consists of volume elements distributed in three dimensions to account for the spatial dependence of the model. the pressure drop of the gaseous helium was calculated based on the darcy-weisbach correlation. additionally, the temperature distribution was solved numerically using adaptive time-stepping. the obtained solutions converge within a timescale on the order of seconds to minutes, and the steady state results along with a transient analysis is discussed.
machine_design	in this paper a design approach for a sensorless controlled, brushless, interior permanent magnet machine is attained. an initial study based on established electrical machine formulas provides the machine 's basic geometrical sizing. the next design stage combines a particle swarm optimisation (pso) search routine with a magneto-static finite element (fe) solver to provide a more in depth optimisation. the optimisation system has been formulated to derive alternative machine design variants, subject to the design constraints, in a computationally efficient manner using as few fe simulations as required. moreover a parallel computing approach has been used for the most computationally intensive processes. the optimisation system objective function aims to find a solution satisfying all the machine 's design requirements including the torque-speed envelope and compatibility with the high-frequency injection based sensorless operation, whilst minimising the machine weight. a holistic approach is presented where a complete machine, including the stator and rotor sub-assemblies are designed accounting for all the required performance measures under the high-frequency injection based sensorless operation. the efficacy of the new approach has been demonstrated on a design case study with consecutive design stages discussed in detail. also, the paper provides conceptual information regarding practical implementation of the proposed optimisation system together with an insight into the definition of the objective function and its influence on the design solutions. furthermore, the calculated results from the optimisation system have been compared with direct fe predictions for the design exemplar showing good correlation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	escherichia coli o157 related foodborne illnesses continue to be one of the most important global public health problems in the world. this study aims to determine e. coli o157 prevalence in 375 chicken meat parts and giblets. the samples were collected randomly from several supermarkets and butchers in diyarbakir, a city in southeast turkey. they were analyzed and confirmed using the immunomagnetic separation (ims), vitek (r) 2 microbial identification system and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. this study also aims to detect the presence of flic(h7), eaea, stx(1), stx(2) and hlya genes by using pcr. the overall e. coli o157 prevalence in chicken meat parts and giblets was 1.3%. all of the e. coli o157 isolates carried rfbe(o157) and eaea genes; but not any flic(h7) and hlya genes. the e. coli o157 isolates obtained from drumstick and breast meat carried either stx(1) or stx(2) genes, which were related to important virulence factors of the disease.
northern_blotting	objective: symptoms of airway diseases are often associated with specific times of the day. for example, midnight worsening of cough is a frequent complaint of patients with laryngitis and bronchitis. we speculate that these symptoms are under the control of the circadian clock, and the clock genes in the airway epithelium play some important roles. in the present study, we tried to prove the time specific expressions of clock oscillating genes in the murine larynx. materials and methods: adult wild-type c57/b16 mice and mcry1(-/-)mcry2(-/-) mutant mice were used for this study. we employed immunohistochemistyr and/or northern blotting for examining the circadian expression of mper1, mper2, c/ebpbeta, hnf3beta, and muc5b. results: the expression of mper2 mrna showed a strong day-night expression difference, which was abolished after the lesion of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and in mcry1(-/-)mcry2(-/-) mutant mice. mper1 and mper2 proteins both showed very similar expression profiles in the epithelium and submucosal glands with a peak in the evening and a trough in the early morning. other nuclear proteins such as c/ebpbeta and hnf3beta did not show the rhythms. muc5b protein showed circadian oscillation in the laryngeal submucosal gland. conclusion: in this study, we confirmed the existence of a local laryngeal clock which is controlled by the central clock in the suprachiasniatic nucleus. muc5b protein in the submucosal mucous gland also showed circadian rhythm. we consider that these rhythmic expressions may cause the time specific symptoms among laryngeal diseases.

immunology	background: home-based interventions to improve indoor air quality have demonstrated benefits for asthma morbidity, yet little is known about the effect of environmental interventions in the school setting. objective: we piloted the feasibility and effectiveness of a classroom-based air cleaner intervention to reduce particulate pollutants in classrooms of children with asthma. methods: in this pilot randomized controlled trial, we assessed the effect of air cleaners on indoor air particulate pollutant concentrations in 18 classrooms (9 control, 9 intervention) in 3 urban elementary schools. we enrolled 25 children with asthma (13 control, 12 intervention) aged 6 to 10 years. classroom air pollutant measurements and spirometry were completed once before and twice after randomization. asthma symptoms were surveyed every 3 months. results: baseline classroom levels of fine particulate matter (particulate matter with diameter of <2.5 mu m [pm2.5]) and black carbon (bc) were 6.3 and 0.41 mu g/m(3), respectively. when comparing the intervention to the control group, classroom pm2.5 levels were reduced by 49% and 42% and bc levels were reduced by 58% and 55% in the first and second follow-up periods, respectively (p<.05 for all comparisons). when comparing the children randomized to intervention and control classrooms, there was a modest improvement in peak flow, but no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) and asthma symptoms. conclusions: in this pilot study, a classroom-based air cleaner intervention led to significant reductions in pm2.5 and bc. future large-scale studies should comprehensively evaluate the effect of school-based environmental interventions on pediatric asthma morbidity.

internal_combustion_engine	this research investigated the effect of guide vanes into the intake runner of a diesel engine run with higher viscous biodiesel to enhance the in-cylinder intake airflow characteristics. first, simulation of an internal combustion engine base model was done. guide vanes of various lengths were developed and imposed into the intake runner to investigate the airflow characteristics. based on the simulation results, five guide vanes models of 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16mm length were constructed and tested on a compression ignition (ci) engine run with biodiesel. according to the experimental results of engine performance and emissions, it was found that guide vanes of 12mm length showed the highest number of improvements with 14mm and 10mm length showed the second and third highest number of improvements, respectively. therefore, this research concluded that guide vanes successfully improved the in-cylinder air flow characteristics to improve the mixing of higher viscous biodiesel with air resulting in better performances of the engines than without vanes.
human_metabolism	folates belong to the b vitamin group based on the parental compound folic acid (fa). they are involved in important biochemical processes like dna synthesis and repair. fa is composed of a pteridine ring, p-aminobenzoic acid and glutamate moieties. the human metabolism is not able to synthesize folates and therefore obtain them from diet. fa, a synthetic vitamin, is used as a food fortificant because of its low price, relative stability and increased bioavailability compared to natural folate forms. fa is known to be a sensitive compound easily degradable in aqueous solution by ultraviolet and visible light towards various by-products. irradiation is a process for preservation of foods that uses accelerated electrons, gamma rays or x-rays. irradiation is proposed for the treatment of various food products, eliminating or reducing pathogens and insects, increasing the storage time and replacing chemical fumigants. this study concerns the identification of degradation products of fa after e-beam irradiation. fa aqueous solutions were irradiated with a van de graaff electrons beam accelerator (2 mev, 100 mu a current, 20 cm scan width, dose rate about 2 kgy/s). applied doses were between 0 (control) and 10.0 kgy. absorbed doses were monitored with fwt 60.00 radiochromic dosimeters.

fluid_mechanics	similar to other renewable energy sources, wind energy is characterized by a low power density. hence, for wind energy to make considerable contributions to the world 's overall energy supply, large wind farms (on- and offshore) consisting of arrays of ever larger wind turbines are being envisioned and built. from a fluid mechanics perspective, wind farms encompass turbulent flow phenomena occurring at many spatial and temporal scales. of particular interest to understanding mean power extraction and fluctuations in wind farms are the scales ranging from 1 to 10 m that comprise the wakes behind individual wind turbines, to motions reaching 100 m to kilometers in scale, inherently associated with the atmospheric boundary layer. in this review, we summarize current understanding of these flow phenomena (particularly mean and second-order statistics) through field studies, wind tunnel experiments, large-eddy simulations, and analytical modeling, emphasizing the most relevant features for wind farm design and operation.
thermodynamics	liquid-liquid equilibrium data for poly vinyl pyrrolidone (pvp) k30+k2hpo4+h2o system were measured at 298.15 k and different ph values (7.54, 8.05, and 9.47). a binodal curve was fitted to the merchuk equation and the tie line compositions were fitted to both the othmer-tobias and bancroft equations. the refractive indices and densities of several homogeneous binary and ternary solutions used for calibration were also measured within a range of 0-30 mass% of pvp and 0-50 mass% of k2hpo4. then, the viscosities, densities, electrical conductivities, and refractive indices of binary (pvp k30+water; potassium phosphate+water) and ternary (pvp k30+potassium phosphate+water) systems were measured and correlated at different ph values. the density data showed a linear variation of the polymer and salt mass fractions. the viscosity data of pvp k30 solutions were correlated as a function of the mass fractions by using a nonlinear equation. the effects of the tie line lengths on the densities and viscosities of the aqueous two-phase systems were represented. also, the modified unifac-nrf is used to calculate the phase equilibria of the mention system. the fitted binary interaction parameters of the model were reported.
human_metabolism	hydroxycinnamic acids are antioxidant phenolic compounds which are widespread in plant foods, contribute significantly to total polyphenol intakes, and are absorbed by humans. the extent of their putative health benefit in vivo depends largely on their bioavailability. however, the mechanisms of absorption and metabolism of these phenolic compounds have not been described. in this study, we used the in vitro caco-2 model of human small intestinal epithelium to investigate the metabolism of the major dietary hydroxycinnamates (ferulate, sinapate, p-coumarate, and caffeate) and of diferulates. the appearance of metabolites in the medium versus time was monitored, and the various conjugates and derivatives produced were identified by hplc-dad, lc/ms, and enzyme treatment with beta-glucuronidase or sulfatase. enterocyte-like differentiated caco-2 cells have extra- and intracellular esterases able to de-esterify hydroxycinnamate and diferulate esters. in addition, intracellular udp-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases existing in caco-2 cells are able to form the sulfate and the glucuronide conjugates of methyl ferulate, methyl sinapate, methyl caffeate, and methyl p-coumarate. however, only the sulfate conjugates of the free acids, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid, were detected after 24 h. the o-methylated derivatives, ferulic and isoferulic acid, were the only metabolites detected following incubation of caco-2 cells with caffeic acid. these results show that the in vitro model system differentiated caco-2 cells have the capacity to metabolize dietary hydroxycinnamates, including various phase i (de-esterification) and phase ii (glucuronidation, sulfation, and o-methylation) reactions, and suggests that the human small intestinal epithelium plays a role in the metabolism and bioavailability of these phenolic compounds.
polymerase_chain_reaction	although some novel antimicrobial peptides (amp) have been successfully isolated from bactrocera dorsalis hendel, the mechanisms underlying the induction of these peptides are still elusive. the homolog of nf-kappa b transcription factor relish, designated as bdrelish, was cloned from b. dorsalis. the full length cdna of bdrelish is 3954 bp with an open reading frame that encodes 1013 amino acids. similar to drosophila relish and the mammalian p100, it is a compound protein containing a conserved rel homology domain, an ipt (ig-like, plexins, transcription factors) domain and an i kappa b-like domain (four ankyrin repeats), the nuclear localization signal rkrrr is also detected at the residues 449-453, suggesting that it has homology to relish and it is a member of the rel family of transcription activator proteins. reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis reveals that bdrelish mrnas are detected in different quantities from various tissues and the highest transcription level of bdrelish is determined in fat body. the injection challenge of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureas significantly upregulated the expression of bdrelish. the injection of bdrelish dsrna markedly reduced the expression of bdrelish and decreased the transcription magnitude of antimicrobial peptides. individuals injected bdrelish dsrna died at a significantly faster rate compared with the control groups. therefore, bdrelish is vital for the transcription of amps to attack the invading bacteria.
human_metabolism	blackcurrant (bc) fruits are a rich source of biologically active anthocyanins but little is known of the anthocyanin content of commonly consumed bc products or how processing affects the absorption. we report that whereas fresh and frozen whole bc were a rich source of anthocyanins, containing 897 and 642 mg (100 g fw)(-1) of total anthocyanins the levels in all other products were substantially lower (0.05-10.3% of the levels in fresh fruit). further, when the absorption and excretion of bc was assessed in volunteers consuming a portion (100 g) of frozen whole bc (642 mg total anthocyanins) and, 300 g of a bc drink made by diluting concentrated syrup (33.6 mg total anthocyanins), only small quantities of bc anthocyanins were excreted in urine (fruit, 0.053 +/- 0.022%; drink, 0.036 +/- 0.043%; mean percent urinary yield +/- sd) and they were not detected in plasma. these data indicate that fresh and frozen bc, but not processed products, are rich sources of anthocyanins but, regardless of the food source, these anthocyanins are poorly bioavailable.

computer-aided_design	the topic of this article is the development of an open-source automated design framework for synthetic biology, specifically for the design of artificial gene regulatory networks based on a digital approach. in opposition to other tools, geneda is an open-source online software based on existing tools used in microelectronics that have proven their efficiency over the last 30 years. the complete framework is composed of a computation core directly adapted from an electronic design automation tool, input and output interfaces, a library of elementary parts that can be achieved with gene regulatory networks, and an interface with an electrical circuit simulator. each of these modules is an extension of microelectronics tools and concepts: odin ii, abc, the verilog language, spice simulator, and systemc-ams. geneda is first validated on a benchmark of several combinatorial circuits. the results highlight the importance of the part library. then, this framework is used for the design of a sequential circuit including a biological state machine.
northern_blotting	clostridium kluyveri is unique in fermenting ethanol and acetate to butyrate, caproate, and h-2. the genes encoding butyrate-producing enzymes, including electron-bifurcating butyryl-coa dehydrogenase/electron transfer flavoprotein complex and nadh-dependent reduced ferredoxin:nadp(+) oxidoreductase, form a cluster, which is preceded by a gene annotated as the transcriptional regulator rex. northern blotting and rt-pcr experiments indicated that the gene cluster forms a large transcriptional unit that possibly includes several small transcriptional units. the deduced rex protein contains a winged helix dna-binding domain and a rossmann fold potentially interacting with nad(h). bioinformatics analysis revealed that rex can bind the promoter regions of numerous genes, which are involved in carbon and energy metabolism, including nadh oxidation, hydrogen production, atp synthesis, butyrate formation, and succinate metabolism. rex may regulate the transcription of genes encoding certain transcriptional regulators and transporters. electrophoretic mobility shift and isothermal titration calorimetry assays revealed that rex specifically formed protein-dna complexes with the promoter regions of target genes, which could be inhibited by nadh but restored by an excess amount of nad(+). these results suggest that rex plays a key role in the carbon and energy metabolism of c. kluyveri as a global transcriptional regulator in response to the cellular nadhinad' ratio.

southern_blotting	banana streak virus (bsv) is a significant constraint to banana production in kenya. the ability to quickly and reliably detect bsv is important for the management of the virus. hence, detection of the variability of bsv was necessary for the optimization of a suitable diagnostic protocol to be used for routine screening of tissue cultured material. in this study, 215 potentially infected banana plants from nine major banana growing regions in kenya were tested for bsv using serological and molecular techniques. virus particles were detected by immunosorbent electron microscopy (isem) in seven of the ten tested samples confirming the presence of bsv. immuno-capture-polymerase chain reaction (ic-pcr) using a degenerate primer was used on extracted viral dna and on immune-captured viral particles from 80 samples. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) confirmed the presence of bsv in 200 samples and ic-pcr in 38 of the 80 tested samples. a total of 33 sequences were obtained from eight samples by pcr (embl accession numbers am 905900-am905905) across the conserved reverse transcriptase/rnaseh region of the genome. pairwise comparison of the sequences suggested that they represented seven different isolates with sequence identity thresholds of 90-100%. southern blotting and hybridization with a radiolabelled probe of the lisulya clone, confirmed that both integrated and episomally replicating viral dna may be present in at least one of the kenya samples. therefore, the presence of bsv in kenya and some diversity within the kenyan population was confirmed. the diagnostic protocol was optimized for the confirmed isolates.
southern_blotting	background: currently, the technology called clearfield (r) is used in the development of crops resistant to herbicides that inhibit the enzyme acetohydroxy acid synthase (ahas, ec 2.2.1.6). ahas is the first enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway that produces the branched-chain of the essential amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. therefore, multiple copies of the ahas gene might be of interest for breeding programs targeting herbicide resistance. in this work, the characterization of the ahas gene was accomplished for the chenopodium quinoa regalona-baer cultivar. cloning, sequencing, and southern blotting were conducted to determine the number of gene copies. results: the presence of multiple copies of the ahas gene as has been shown previously in several other species is described. six copies of the ahas gene were confirmed with southern blot analyses. cqhas1 and cqahas2 variants showed the highest homology with ahas mrna sequences found in the nr database. a third copy, cqahas3, shared similar fragments with both cqahas1 and cqahas2, suggesting duplication through homeologous chromosomes pairing. conclusions: the presence of multiple copies of the gene ahas shows that gene duplication is a common feature in polyploid species during evolution. in addition, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the interaction of sub-genomes in quinoa.

manufacturing_engineering	modern manufacturing and business based on product service systems require software platforms capable of supporting offerings over their lifecycle thus securing long term customer value. also a function to get and manage feedback from end users, customers and manufacturing is essential for design to build in functionalities and features that best enable efficient use and maintenance. the aim is to integrate the product life-cycle management (plm) and service life-cycle management (slm) concepts resulting in a coherent and collaborative product-service design and manufacturing engineering platform. the concept requirements were collected from four real world use cases and refined and combined to create final set of requirements. in this paper we present the facilitated requirement collection process and the final requirements in relation to engineering collaboration and product-service system characteristics.
cell_biology	transgenic pigs failed to accord milk yield curve to lactate rhfix-a vitamin k (vk) dependent protein even fed with vk enriched to 8 times higher than nutritional requirement. a further higher vk supplementation may be required. homozygous transgenic sows (n = 4, 200 kg) at their 3rd nursing were divided into control and treatment groups and respectively received vk enriched and further menadione (soluble vk) supplemented diet (220 mg/kg vk enriched diet) for 33 days. at next lactation, control sows than received treatment and previous treated were fed on control diet. results revealed that menadione treatment increased milk bioactivity of rhfix from the 7th day of 73 to the 21st day of 153 iu/ml; it gradually decreased to 96 iu/ml on 35th day of lactation. under control feeding, bioactivity remained relatively unchanged. however, milk rhfix concentration and ratio of activated rhfix responded little to the treatment. the menadione-induced bioactivity curve agrees with the known lactation pattern of sow means rhfix secretion is still galactopoietic but requires high vk intake to show. the ineffectual vk spend on lactational carboxylation might be common in other mammary vk dependent expression system but can be effectively overcome by a high supplementation of menadione with a 5-folds improvement in quality.
molecular_biology	india is rich in genetic diversity of major pulse crops, but the productivity and the production of pulse crops remains low compared to the world and hence, there is a need to enhance the utilization for increasing the production. major pulse species for which genetic diversity is occurring in india include vigna, cajanus, cicer, pisum, lens, phaseolus and few minor pulses such as macrotyloma, canavalia, lathyrus, vicia, mucuna, moghania and rhynchosia etc. national bureau of pint genetic resources (nbpgr) is the nodal institute for the ""management of plant genetic resources in india. it has assembled-70,000 accessions of different pulse crops majoring cajanus cajan, cicer arietinum, phaseolus vulgaris, pisum sativum, vigna mungo, vigna radiata, vigna umbellata, vigna unguiculata, viceasp. and lens sp. through collection and introduction from india and from >70 other countries of the world. several pests of quarantine significance have been identified and salvaged from the exotic germplasm. the ex situ base collection at nbpgr conserve 64,744 accessions of 20 genera and 61 species of pulses. this germplasm has been characterized for agro-morphological, quality and biochemical traits, biotic and abiotic stresses for identifying trait-specific reference sets and 28 catalogues describing about 45,000 accessions of 14 pulse crops. a total of 121 accessions of various pulse crops have been registered as unique/potential donors. core and mini cores have been developed in chickpea, pigeonpea, common bean, mungbean, adzuki bean, cowpea, lentil, moth bean and pea both nationally and internationally. wild species of pulse crops have been utilized for transferring desirable traits into cultivated species. application of modern tools and technologies of molecular biology will accelrate the process of gene transfer for improvement of pulse crops.
internal_combustion_engine	as part of a two-part life cycle efficiency and greenhouse gas emission analysis for various automotive fuels in the indian context, this paper presents the first part, i.e., tank-to-wheel analysis of various fuel/powertrain configurations for a subcompact passenger car. the tank-to-wheel analysis was applied to 28 fuel/powertrain configurations using fuels such as gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and hydrogen with various conventional and hybrid electric powertrains. the gasoline equivalent fuel economy and carbon dioxide emission results for individual fuel/powertrain configuration are evaluated and compared. it is found that the split hybrid configuration is best among hybrids as it leads to fuel economy improvement and carbon dioxide emissions reduction by 20-40% over the indian drive cycle. further, the engine efficiency, engine on-off time and regenerative braking energy assessment is done to evaluate the causes for higher energy efficiency of hybrid electric vehicles. the hybridization increases average engine efficiency by 10-60% which includes 19-23% of energy recovered at wheel through regenerative braking over the drive cycle. overall, the tank-to-wheel energy use and efficiency results are evaluated for all fuel/powertrain configurations which show battery electric vehicle, fuel cell vehicles and diesel hybrids are near and long term energy efficient vehicle configurations.

genetics	background: at present, the metaphase ii (mii) oocytes have a very special structure that leads to complex difficulties associated with its vitrification, and their efficacy still needs a large amount of study to observe. the present study was to investigate whether transient hydrostatic pressure (thp), which was utilized for oocytes before vitrification, had positive effect on the oocytes' developmental ability and reactive oxygen species, and had no damage on meiotic spindle, zona pellucida, and dna copy number. methods: all the immature oocytes used in this research were collected between february 2015 and december 2015 in shanghai ji ai genetics & ivf institute. the mii oocytes, which were originated from metaphase i (mi) oocytes, were randomly distributed into three groups: a) fresh oocytes; b) vitrification; and c) vitrification after thp treatment. the embryo developmental outcome was evaluated after intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo culture. furthermore, the meiotic spindle behavior, reactive oxygen species (ros), zona pellucida (zp), and dna copy number variation were evaluated and compared among the three groups. results: a total of 568 mii oocytes were included in the study. embryos from group b had fewer cells on day 3 compared with group a and c (5.01 +/- 2.11 for group a, 3.89 +/- 2.21 for group b, and 4.69 +/- 2.05 for group c). the developmental feature of blastocyst in groups a and c were superior to those of group b. the mii oocytes were manipulated with thp before vitrification, and the equilibration time was significantly shorter in the vitrification procedure (244.9 +/- 30.1 vs. 181.5 +/- 10.1). the ros, zp of vitrified/warmed oocytes in group c were improved with thp before vitrification. thp had no influence on the meiotic spindle and dna copy number variation of vitrified/warmed oocytes. conclusions: the results of the study indicated that sublethal thp treatment before vitrification increased the developmental competence of human in vitro matured oocytes, reduced vitrification related changes in the ros, which occurred during oocyte vitrification, and did not damage the meiotic spindle, zp and dna copy number variation.

northern_blotting	human mitochondrial long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have not been described to date. by analysis of deep-sequencing data we have identified three lncrnas generated from the mitochondrial genome and confirmed their expression by northern blotting and strand-specific qrt-pcr. we show that the abundance of these lncrnas is comparable to their complementary mrnas and that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins involved in rna processing regulate their expression. we also identify the 5' and 3' transcript ends of the three lncrnas and show that mitochondrial rnase p protein 1 (mrpp1) is important for the processing of these transcripts. finally, we show that mitochondrial lncrnas form intermolecular duplexes and that their abundance is cell-and tissue-specific, suggesting a functional role in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.
immunology	johne 's disease, caused by infection with mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (map), is a chronic wasting disease of ruminants. hallmark symptoms of clinical johne 's disease include diarrhea, progressive weight loss, and premature death; symptoms due largely to chronic inflammation in the small intestine. map colonizes resident macrophages within the ileum of the small intestine, subsequently establishing a persistent infection in the host. it has been proposed that regulatory t cells may play a role in the progression of johne 's disease, either through promotion of tolerance to map or via a loss in homeostasis that subsequently allows widespread inflammation. in this report, we evaluated the presence of tregs, as well as other immune parameters, in the ileum and draining lymph nodes of map associated lesions. a lesion classification scheme was developed to categorize severity of map-induced lesions within infected tissues and subsequently regulatory t cell presence and overall immune activity were assessed corresponding to lesions of varying severity, in comparison to tissues from healthy control animals. our results revealed a relationship between animal health and overall lesion severity within the infected tissues, as well as a relationship between bacterial burden and severity of pathology. regulatory t cell abundance was shown to decrease with increasing lesion severity. within the ileum, the expression of many th1, th2, and treg-associated genes increased in mild lesions and decreased in severe lesions, whereas in the lymph nodes the expression of these genes tended to increase with increasing lesion severity. based on our results, we conclude that a local loss of t cell (including treg) activity occurs within severe heal lesions associated with map, resulting in a loss of homeostasis that ultimately leads to the progression of clinical johne 's disease.

southern_blotting	in chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection, variants with mutations in the basal core promoter (bcp) and precore region predominate and associate with more severe disease forms. studies on their effect on viral replication remain controversial. increasing evidence shows that epigenetic modifications of cccdna regulate hbv replication and disease outcome. here we determined the transcription and viral replication efficiency of well-defined bcp and precore mutations and their effect on cccdna epigenetic control. hbv monomers bearing bcp mutations a1762t/g1764a and a1762t/g1764a/c1766t, and precore mutations g1896a, g1899a and g1896a/g1899a, were transfected into hepg2 cells using a plasmid-free approach. viral rna transcripts were detected by northern blot hybridization and rt pcr, dna replicative intermediates by southern blotting and rt pcr, and viral release was measured by elisa. acetylation of cccdna-bound histones was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assay and methylation of cccdna by bisulfite sequencing. bcp mutations resulted in low viral release, mrna transcription and pgrna/cccdna ratios that paralleled the acetylation of cccdna-bound h4 histone and inversely correlated with the hdac1 recruitment onto cccdna. independently of the mutations, cccdna was a target for methylation, accompanied by the upregulation of dnmt1 expression and dnmt1 recruitment onto cccdna. our results suggest that bcp mutations decrease viral replication capacity possibly by modulating the acetylation and deacetylation of cccdna-bound histones while precore mutations do not have a significant effect on viral replication. these data provide evidence that epigenetic factors contribute to the regulation of hbv viral replication.

human_metabolism	accelerator mass spectrometry (ams) is an extremely sensitive nuclear physics technique developed in the mid-70 's for radiocarbon dating of historical artefacts. the technique centres round the use of a tandem van de graaff accelerator to generate the potential energy to permit separation of elemental isotopes at the single atom level. ams was first used in the early 90 's for the analysis of biological samples containing enriched c-14 for toxicology and cancer research. since that time biomedical ams has been used in the study of (1) metabolism of xenobiotics in animals and humans (2) pathways of drug metabolism (3) biomarkers (4) metabolism of endogenous molecules including vitamins (5) dna and protein binding studies and (6) clinical diagnosis. a new drug development concept which relies on the ultrasensitivity of ams known as human microdosing (phase 0) is being used to obtain early human metabolism information of candidate drugs arising out of discovery. these various aspects of ams are reviewed in this article and a perspective on future applications of ams provided.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the eco-toxicological effects of bacillus thuringiensis (bt) maize on earthworm life-history traits were widely studied and the results were controversial, while their effects on earthworm bacterial community have been rarely studied. here, effects of two hybrids of bt maize [5422bt1 (event bt11) and 5422cbcl (mon810)] straw return on eisenia fetida bacterial community were investigated by the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) combing with dna sequencing, compared to near-isogenic non-bt maize (5422). bt maize straw return had significant effects on soil nutrients, especially for available nitrogen (n). the significant differences were shown in soil bacterial community between bt and non-bt maize treatments on the 75th and 90th d, which was closely correlated with soil available n, p and k rather than crylab protein. there was no statistically significant difference in the bacterial community of earthworm gut contents between bt and non-bt maize treatments. the significant differences in the bacterial community of earthworm casts were found among three maize varieties treatments, which were closely correlated with crylab protein and n levels. the differentiated bacterial species in earthworm casts mainly belonged to proteobacteria, including brevundimonas, caulobacter, pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, methylobacterium, asticcacaulis and achromobacter etc., which were associated with the mineralization, metabolic process and degradation of plants residues. therefore, bt maize straw return caused changes in the bacterial community of e. fetida casts, which was possibly caused by the direct (crylab protein) and non-expected effects (n levels) of bt maize straw.

enzymology	proteins targeted for degradation by the mycobacterial proteasome are covalently modified with prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (pup) in a process termed ""pupylation."" despite its name, pup is only ubiquitin-like in function and not sequence or structure. furthermore, the enzymology of pupylation appears to be distinct from protein modification by ubiquitin (ub) and other ubiquitin-like proteins (ubls). nonetheless, we have adapted methods established in the ub field for the production of reagents to isolate, identify, and analyze pupylated proteins in mycobacteria. these methods can be modified to study specific pupylated proteins in various pup-bearing bacteria or to identify posttranslational modifiers in other prokaryotes.
immunology	transfusion of blood cell components is frequent in the therapeutic arsenal; it is globally safe or even very safe. at present, residual clinical manifestations are principally inflammatory in nature. if some rare clinical hazards manifest as acute inflammation symptoms of various origin, most of them linked with conflicting and undesirable biological material accompanying the therapeutic component (infectious pathogen, pathogenic antibody, unwanted antigen, or allergen), the general feature is subtler and less visible, and essentially consists of alloimmunization or febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction. the present essay aims to present updates in hematology and immunology that help understand how, when, and why subclinical inflammation underlies alloimmunization and circumstances characteristic of red blood cells and - even more frequently - platelets that contribute inflammatory mediators. modern transfusion medicine makes sustained efforts to limit such inflammatory hazards; efforts can be successful only if one has a clear view of each element 's role.
manufacturing_engineering	this paper introduces preliminary developments of an nsf-funded on-going educational project. the project goal is to enhance student technical and professional skills and business knowledge by integrating lean manufacturing education into a traditional manufacturing engineering program. a group of faculty members with complementary background and expertise in engineering and business co-taught a new lean course that attracted student enrollments from five departments across campus. in addition to plant tours, guest lectures' and real-world industrial projects, we particularly designed an innovative and unique experience, lean lego simulation (lls), which has proven valuable for students to better understand lean principles and applications. course survey shows student feedback was overwhelmingly positive. evaluation is also being carried out to measure how well the project is working from the viewpoint of all participants especially faculty collaboration and student achievements.
genetics	aim. we tested the performance of the tissue homogenizer bead beater millmix 20 (tehtnica - domel) for grinding the bone samples from skeletal remains for sub sequential extraction and dna typing of human identification short tandem repeats (strs). methods. we analyzed 60 bone dna extracts obtained from femurs and tibias. from 13 bones (6 femurs and 7 tibias) analyses were repeated two and from 4 femurs three times to evaluate the repeatability of the extraction method and grinding machine used. dna was obtained from 0.5 g of demineralizated bone powder and the samples were quantified using the human quantifiler or the investigator quantiplex kit. str typing was performed using the ngm or the investigator essplex plus kit to evaluate the quality of bone powder and tested extraction method. results. of the profiles obtained from 60 dna extracts, 73% were full, 17% acceptable, 8% quite acceptable and only 2% of the profiles were not suitable for interpretation which represent a 98% success rate. from 17 bones analyses were repeated two or three times and results obtained show high degree of repeatability since very similar results were obtained from almost all of the repetition. conclusion. grinding the bone samples using the millmix 20 has proven highly successful in recovery of high-quality powder from skeletal remains. we believe that the results obtained will contribute to the possibilities of using automated devices for grinding the bone samples, which would shorten the procedures for obtaining high-quality bone powder from skeletons in forensic laboratories.
southern_blotting	the significant breakthrough in plant biotechnology is the development of techniques to transform genes from unrelated sources into commercially important crop plants to develop resistance against insect pests. a local cotton cultivar mnh-93 was transformed through agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c58c(1) assisted by bombardment with tungsten particles. the agrobacterium strain contained the recombinant binary vector pkmab harboring crylab under 35s promoter. neomycin phosphotransferase (nptii) gene was used as a selectable marker at a concentration of 50 mg l-1. the transformation efficiency remained 0.26%. the primary transformants were analyzed for transgene integration and expression through pcr and southern blotting and western dot blot. the gene copy number was determined by southern analysis in order to find out the crylab integration sites. the bt protein being produced in the transgenic plants was quantified using imagequant software, which ranged from 0.00 to 1.35% of the total protein. the positive plant seeds obtained from to progeny were further raised under greenhouse and field conditions to evaluate their field performance. leaf biotoxicity assays were performed to determine the efficacy of introduced gene. the results showed that transgenic lines in t-1 progeny have appreciable level of resistance (40-60%) against lepidopteran pests in both green house and field conditions.
molecular_biology	family study can provide estimates of overall genetic influences on a particular trait because family relationships provide accurate measures of average genetic sharing. however, evidence of genetic contributions to skin phenotypes is limited, which may preclude genetic studies to identify genetic variants or to understand underlying molecular biology of skin traits. this study aimed to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to selected dermatologic phenotypes, that is, to melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity level in a korean twin-family cohort. we investigated more than 2,000 individuals from 486 families, including 388 monozygotic twin pairs and 82 dizygotic twin pairs. variance component method was used to estimate genetic influences in terms of heritability. heritability of skin melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity (arm and cheek) were estimated to be 0.44 [ 95% ci 0.38-0.49], 0.21 [ 95% ci 0.16-0.26], 0.13 [ 95% ci 0.07-0.18], and 0.11 [ 95% ci 0.06-0.16] respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. our findings suggest that genetics play a major role on skin melanin index, but only mild roles on sebum secretion and humidity. sebum secretion and skin humidity are controlled predominantly by environmental factors notably on shared environments among family members. we expect that our findings add insight to determinants of common dermatologic traits, and serve as a reference for biologic studies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	adipose and endothelial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular disease. perivascular adipose tissue (pvat) directly surrounds vessels and influences vessel function via a paracrine effect, and adenosine monophosphate (amp)-activated protein kinase (ampk) modulates the metabolic pathway, thus, the present study hypothesized that activation of ampk in pvat may regulate endothelial function in pathological settings. the present study investigated the effect of methotrexate (mtx) on adipocytokine expression in pvat with an emphasis on the regulation of endothelial function. the effects of mtx and the mechanisms involved were investigated using a relaxation assay and western blot analysis. reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to detect the mrna and protein expression levels. elisa assay was used to quantify the level of tnf-alpha and il-6. palmitic acid (pa) stimulation induced inflammation and dysregulation of adipocytokine expression in pvat. mtx treatment inhibited nuclear factor-kappa b p65 phosphorylation and downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, whereas adiponectin expression increased. mtx increased ampk phosphorylation under basal and inflammatory conditions in pvat, whereas knockdown of ampk via small interfering rna diminished its modulatory effect, indicating that mtx inhibits inflammation in an ampk-dependent manner. the present study prepared conditioned medium from pa-stimulated pvat to induce endothelial dysfunction and observed that pre-treatment of pvat with mtx effectively restored the loss of acetylcholine-induced vasodilation and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in the rat aorta. the results of the present study demonstrated that mtx ameliorated inflammation-associated adipocytokine dysregulation and thus prevented endothelial dysfunction. these data provide further pharmacological evidence regarding the beneficial effects of mtx in cardiovascular diseases.
machine_design	the optimal design of electric machines requires a significant amount of computation time, since the design is usually performed based on finite-element analysis (fea) for better accuracy. for this reason, the development of an optimization algorithm is regarded as a prerequisite to reduce the number of objective function call, which is directly related to computation time. the local search algorithm does not guarantee that the global optimum solution can be searched effectively. therefore, in this paper, we introduce the novel optimization method, search region management (srm), to improve the efficiency of the local search algorithm. srm uses a guided random bit generation based on gray code for the region selection when the local search iterates the optimum search process for a multi-start. in addition, the srm saves and manages the information of previous searched points to prevent overlapping calculation and to increase the effectiveness of the local search during every iteration process. to clarify the effectiveness of the proposed method for electric machine design, it is applied to the optimal design of brushless dc motor coupled with fea minimizing torque ripple.
enzymology	since 1970s', chinese enzymologists have obtained a lot of distinguished achievements on the basic research on enzymes. at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of progress in biochemistry and biophysics, this paper is attempted to review the selected achievements from the systematically enzymic research in china.
hydraulics	induced earthquakes often accompany fluid injection, and the seismic hazard they pose threatens various underground engineering projects. models to monitor and control induced seismic hazard with traffic light systems should be probabilistic, forward-looking, and updated as new data arrive. in this study, we propose an induced seismicity test bench to test and rank such models; this test bench can be used for model development, model selection, and ensemble model building. we apply the test bench to data from the basel 2006 and soultz-sous-forets 2004 geothermal stimulation projects, and we assess forecasts from two models: shapiro and smoothed seismicity (sass) and hydraulics and seismics (hysei). these models incorporate a different mix of physics-based elements and stochastic representation of the induced sequences. our results show that neither model is fully superior to the other. generally, hysei forecasts the seismicity rate better after shut-in but is only mediocre at forecasting the spatial distribution. on the other hand, sass forecasts the spatial distribution better and gives better seismicity rate estimates before shut-in. the shut-in phase is a difficult moment for both models in both reservoirs: the models tend to underpredict the seismicity rate around, and shortly after, shut-in.
southern_blotting	plant defensins are group of small, cysteine stabilized antimicrobial peptides rich in basic amino acids which inhibit growth of a multitude of phytopathogens. these defensins have been explored widely to generate transgenic crop plants resistant to varied fungal and bacterial diseases. in the present study, gene sequence coding for a seed defensin (sm-amp-d1) of common chickweed stellaria media was synthesized artificially and cloned downstream of a strong constitutive promoter in pcambia-1301 plant expression vector. transgenic banana plants expressing the sm-amp-d1 gene were subsequently generated via agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. transgenic nature of the regenerated banana plants was confirmed by genomic dna pcr and southern blotting analysis. northern blots demonstrated efficient expression of sm-amp-d1 mrna in transgenic banana plants. further, two selected transgenic lines challenged with a pathogenic isolate of fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 1 showed improved resistance as compared to untransformed control banana plants. these transgenic lines continued to show resistance against foc race 1 6 months post-infection. this study demonstrates that overexpression of potent plant defensins such as sm-amp-d1 in important food crops like banana can lead to development of durable resistance against fungal pathogens.
strength_of_materials	research on the development of an ideal dental composite is still ongoing and is focused more on the filler content and polymerization. silica is an important filler used in several commercial dental composites. at present the silica used in the fabrication of dental composites is synthesized by the classic sol-gel method, using toxic and expensive precursors and chemicals. rice husk is an abundant source of silica and malaysia is a major rice producing country. this study is aimed at extracting spherical nanosilica from rice husk using an environment friendly and inexpensive method, and its inclusion as fillers in dental nanocomposites. spherical nanosilica was extracted from rice husk using a simple precipitation method employing non-toxic chemicals. the dental nanocomposite thus prepared was subjected to flexural strength and modulus tests, which are important tests for predicting the strength of materials. the flexural strength of the dental composite was 82 mpa and the modulus was 6.8 gpa. the results indicate that rice husk, which is an agricultural waste, is a good and inexpensive source of silica to be used as fillers for fabrication of dental nanocomposites with good mechanical properties.
cell_biology	in bacteria, the control of mrna stability is crucial to allow rapid adaptation to changing conditions. in most bacteria, rna degradation is catalyzed by the rna degradosome, a protein complex composed of endo- and exoribonucleases, rna helicases, and accessory proteins. in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis, the existence of a rna degradosome assembled around the membrane-bound endoribonuclease rnase y has been proposed. here, we have studied the intracellular localization of the protein that have been implicated in the potential b. subtilis rna degradosome, i.e., polynucleotide phosphorylase, the exoribonucleases j1 and j2, the dead-box rna helicase csha, and the glycolytic enzymes enolase and phosphofructokinase. our data suggests that the bulk of these enzymes is located in the cytoplasm. the rnases j1 and j2 as well as the rna helicase csha were mainly localized in the peripheral regions of the cell where also the bulk of messenger rna is localized. we were able to demonstrate active exclusion of these proteins from the transcribing nucleoid. taken together, our findings suggest that the interactions of the enzymes involved in rna degradation in b. subtilis are rather transient.
genetics	the current focus on delivery of personalised (or precision) medicine reflects the expectation that developments in genomics, imaging and other domains will extend our diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, and enable more effective targeting of current and future preventative and therapeutic options. the clinical benefits of this approach are already being realised in rare diseases and cancer but the impact on management of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, remains limited. this may reflect reliance on inappropriate models of disease architecture, based around rare, high-impact genetic and environmental exposures that are poorly suited to our emerging understanding of type 2 diabetes. this review proposes an alternative 'palette' model, centred on a molecular taxonomy that focuses on positioning an individual with respect to the major pathophysiological processes that contribute to diabetes risk and progression. this model anticipates that many individuals with diabetes will have multiple parallel defects that affect several of these processes. one corollary of this model is that research efforts should, at least initially, be targeted towards identifying and characterising individuals whose adverse metabolic trajectory is dominated by perturbation in a restricted set of processes.
materials_engineering	understanding of metal oxidation is critical to corrosion control, catalysis synthesis, and advanced materials engineering. although, metal oxidation process is rather complicated, different processes, many of them coupled, are involved from the onset of reaction. since first introduced, there has been great success in applying heteroepitaxial theory to the oxide growth on a metal surface as demonstrated in the cu oxidation experiments. in this paper, we review the recent progress in experimental findings on cu oxidation as well as the advances in the theoretical simulations of the cu oxidation process. we focus on the effects of defects such as step edges, present on realistic metal surfaces, on the oxide growth dynamics. we show that the surface steps can change the mass transport of both cu and o atoms during oxide growth, and ultimately lead to the formation of different oxide morphology. we also review the oxidation of cu alloys and explore the effect of a secondary element to the oxide growth on a cu surface. from the review of the work on cu oxidation, we demonstrate the correlation of theoretical simulations at multiple scales with various experimental techniques.

materials_engineering	chitosan-based magnetite nanocomposites were synthesized using a versatile ultrasound assisted in situ method involving one quick step. this synthetic route approach results in the formation of spheroidal nanoparticles (fe3o4) with average diameter between 10 and 24 nm, which were found to be superparamagnetic with saturation magnetization (ms) ranges from 32-57 emu g(-1), depending on the concentration. the incorporation of fe3o4 into chitosan matrix was also confirmed by ftir and tg techniques. this hybrid nanocomposite has the potential application as electrochemical sensors, since the electrochemical signal was excepitionally stable. in addition, the in situ strategy proposed in this work allowed us to synthesize the nanocomposite system in a short time, around 2 min of time-consuming, showing great potential to replace conventional methods. herein, the procedure will permit a further diversity of applications into nanocomposite materials engineering.

molecular_biology	relationships between the abundance of potential geosmin- and 2-methylisoborneol-producing (2-mib) cyanobacteria and bacteria, and concentrations of the two taste and odour compounds (t&os) were examined in a 7 day incubation of natural water from the surface and bottom of three reservoirs in southeast queensland, australia. only a single known t&o-producing cyanobacterium (geitlerinema spp.) was detected by microscopy at low density, and only in one reservoir. densities of potential t&o-producing streptomyces (determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay) were highest in the bottom water and varied from 0.7 x 10(3) to 775 x 10(3) cells l-1. geosmin ranged from 6 to 59 ng l-1 (with the highest concentrations in the bottom water), while 2-mib varied from 6 to 47 ng l-1 (with the highest concentration in surface water). concentrations of both compounds declined during the incubation under both light and dark conditions. presence of the geosmin synthase gene, geoa, in cyanobacteria and streptomyces was examined by different pcr approaches. cloning of pcr products from amplification of geoa showed a high similarity to geoa in cyanobacteria, but not to streptomycetes. our results demonstrate that more research on the ecology and molecular biology of t&o producers is required to better understand the dynamics of t&os and to monitor emerging t&o episodes.
northern_blotting	the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (nasba) method of detecting noroviruses in artificially and naturally contaminated shellfish. we used 58 fecal samples that tested positive for noroviruses with electron microscopy (em) to develop an nasba assay for these viruses. oligonucleotide primers targeting the polymerase coding region were used to amplify the viral rna in an isothermal process that resulted in the accumulation of rna amplicons. these amplicons were detected by hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes that were highly specific for genogroup i (gi) and genogroup ii (gii) of noroviruses. the expected band of 327 bp appeared in denaturing agarose gel without any nonspecific band. the specific signal for each amplicon was obtained through northern blotting in many repeats. all fecal samples of which 46 (79.3%) belonged to gii and 12 (20.6%) belonged to gi were positive for noroviruses by em and by nasba. target rna concentrations as low as 5 pg/ml were detected in fecal specimens using nasba. when the assay was applied to artificially contaminated shellfish, the sensitivity to nucleic acid was 100 pg/1.5 g shellfish tissue. the potential use of this assay was also confirmed in naturally contaminated shellfish collected from different ponds in guangzhou city of china, of which 24 (18.76%) out of 128 samples were positive for noroviruses; of these, 19 (79.6 %) belonged to gii and 5 (20.4%) belonged to gi. the nasba assay provided a more rapid and efficient way of detecting noroviruses in fecal samples and demonstrated its potential for detecting noroviruses in food and environmental samples with high specificity and sensitivity.
manufacturing_engineering	in manufacturing engineering, there are several areas of knowledge focused on the study of manufacturing processes that give rise to products supplied to the processing industries and products to final consumers that can be processed from sheet, wires, rods and beams. in both cases, one of the most widely used manufacturing processes is the ""metal forming"" which is the mechanical process that pieces can be obtained by compression of solid metal in molds using plastic deformation of the material for filling the molds cavities. however, there is a process that can do the same without the need for molds, the so-called incremental sheet forming which consists of drawing the workpiece on a cnc form milling using a small cylindrical punch with a rounded tip. the purpose of this work is to make a study of the process of incremental sheet forming of polymers as a new type of rapid prototyping technology that is based on the process of forming material, different from the existing processes for removing or adding material. the tests were done in a geometry pyramid trunk format, in three subsequent stages and the objective is to evaluate some parameters such as temperature of working and the punch diameter in the final result of the prototype. the material chosen for the study was the pvc because that is present in many studies already done on the subject. tests made with pvc indicated that a variation in 20 degrees c of material working temperature resulted in a significant increase in forming results during the tests.

polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose keratoconus (kc) is thinning of the central cornea. its etiology is unknown, but it may result from degrading of collagen type iv. the major protein in the cornea is collagen. matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) is able to degrade collagen type iv from the basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ecm). mmp-9 enzymatic activity is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1). in the present study, we sought to investigate and evaluate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms in col4a3, mmp-9, and timp-1 on the risk of kc in an iranian population sample. methods this case-control study was performed on 140 kc patients and 150 healthy controls. genotyping of the col4a3 rs55703767, mmp-9 rs17576, and timp-1 rs6609533 polymorphisms was done using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (arms-pcr). result our findings showed that the rs55703767g/t polymorphism decreased the risk of kc (or = 0.26, 95% ci = 0.08-0.82, p = 0.022). rs17576a/g, associated with kc and the a allele, was significantly overrepresented in healthy individuals. rs6609533a/g (x-chromosome) increased the risk of kc in females (or = 2.27, 95% ci = 1.06-4.76, p = 0.036). in males, the allele frequency was not associated with kc risk/protection. conclusions this study indicates that in our population, the col4a3 rs55703767 polymorphism decreased the risk of kc. however, the timp-1 rs6609533 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of kc.
genetics	mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (lrrk2) gene are the most common genetic cause of parkinson 's disease. here, we investigated whether the g2019s lrrk2 mutation causes morphological and/or functional changes at nigro-striatal dopamine neurons. density of striatal dopaminergic terminals, nigral cell counts, tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels as well as exocytotic dopamine release measured in striatal synaptosomes, or striatal extracellular dopamine levels monitored by in vivo microdialysis were similar between >= 12-month-old g2019s knock-in mice and wild-type controls. in vivo striatal dopamine release was insensitive to the lrrk2 inhibitor nov-lrrk2-11, and was elevated by the membrane dopamine transporter blocker gbr-12783. however, g2019s knock-in mice showed a blunted neurochemical and motor activation response to gbr-12783 compared to wildtype controls. western blot and dopamine uptake analysis revealed an increase in dopamine transporter levels and activity in the striatum of 12-month-old g2019s ki mice. this phenotype correlated with a reduction in vesicular monoamine transporter 2 levels and an enhancement of vesicular dopamine uptake, which was consistent with greater resistance to reserpine-induced hypolocomotion. these changes were not observed in 3-month-old mice. finally, western blot analysis revealed no genotype difference in striatal levels of endogenous alpha-synuclein or alpha-synuclein bound to dopal (a toxic metabolite of dopamine). however, serine129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein levels were higher in 12-month-old g2019s knock-in mice. immunohistochemistry confirmed this finding, also showing no genotype difference in 3-month-old mice. we conclude that the g2019s mutation causes progressive dysfunctions of dopamine transporters, along with serine129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein overload, at striatal dopaminergic terminals, which are not associated with dopamine homeostasis dysregulation or neuron loss but might contribute to intrinsic dopaminergic terminal vulnerability. we propose g2019s knock-in mice as a presymptomatic parkinson 's disease model, useful to investigate the pathogenic interaction among genetics, aging, and internal or environmental factors leading to the disease.
genetics	background: the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213, a susceptibility variant for moyamoya disease (mmd), may be associated with non-mmd intracranial artery steno-occlusive disease of non-mmd type (nonmmd icad) in asian. we investigated whether the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 affect the development of non-mmd icad in koreans compared to mmd and control group. methods: we included 31 patients with non-mmd icad, 25 patients with mmd, and 100 participants as control group. the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of target and detection by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. clinical phenotype was compared between patients with and without the rs112735431 polymorphism in non-mmd icad and mmd. results: the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 was significantly associated with non-mmd icad (p = 0.001; odds ratio, 143; 95% confidence interval, 2.80-73.2) and mmd (p < 0.0001; odds ratio, 126.0; 95% confidence interval, 24.2-656.0). the rate of hypertension was more frequent in mmd with the rs112735431 polymorphism than mmd without polymorphism (p = 0.010). conclusions: the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 is highly associated not only with mmd but also with non-mmd icad in koreans. also, our study suggests that the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 may be linked to the hypertension in mmd. further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 and hypertension in patients with mmd.

northern_blotting	full length cdnas of cucumber mosaic virus (cmv) cb7 strain, causing necrosis on nicotiana glutinosa, were obtained by rt-pcr, using viral genomic rnas as templates. cdnas of cnw-cb7 genomic rnas were cloned and sequenced and results indicated that rnai, 2 and 3 was 3 356 nt, 3 045 nt and 2 218 nt, respectively (accordingly accession number ef216866, dq785470 and ef216867). infectious rna transcripts from cdna clones of cmv-cb7 were inoculated onto n. glutinosa and the seedlings of host plants displayed necrosis symptom, whist that of cmv-fny induced typical mosaic symptoms. through pseudorecombination between cmv-cb7 and cnw-fny genomic rnas, the genetic determinant of necrosis phenotype was mapped to rna2. chimeric infectious clones consisting of partial sequences of rna2 derived from cnw-cb7 and cnw-fny, respectively, were obtained by overlapping pcr. pathogenic analysis with those chimeric rna2 revealed that 2b gene or 3' utr of cmv-cb7 rna2 was responsible for the necrotic pathotype. northern blotting analysis reflected that both necrotic and non-necrotic viruses accumulated to similar levels of genomic rnas in host plants. therefore, necrotic phenotype induced on n. glutinosa was not related to the level of accumulation of cmv genomic rnas.
materials_engineering	bacterial cellulose is a strong and ultrapure form of cellulose produced naturally by several species of the acetobacteraceae. its high strength, purity, and biocompatibility make it of great interest to materials science; however, precise control of its biosynthesis has remained a challenge for biotechnology. here we isolate a strain of komagataeibacter rhaeticus (k. rhaeticus igem) that can produce cellulose at high yields, grow in low-nitrogen conditions, and is highly resistant to toxic chemicals. we achieved external control over its bacterial cellulose production through development of a modular genetic toolkit that enables rational reprogramming of the cell. to further its use as an organism for biotechnology, we sequenced its genome and demonstrate genetic circuits that enable functionalization and patterning of heterologous gene expression within the cellulose matrix. this work lays the foundations for using genetic engineering to produce cellulose-based materials, with numerous applications in basic science, materials engineering, and biotechnology.
hydraulics	chemoheterotrophic denitrification technologies using woodchips as a solid carbon source (i.e., wood chip bioreactors) have been widely trialed for treatment of diffuse-source agricultural nitrogen pollution. there is growing interest in the use of this simple, relatively low-cost biological wastewater treatment option in waters with relatively higher total suspended solids (tss) and chemical oxygen demand (cod) such as aquaculture wastewater. this work: (1) evaluated hydraulic retention time (hrt) impacts on cod/tss removal, and (2) assessed the potential for woodchip clogging under this wastewater chemistry. four pilot-scale woodchip denitrification bioreactors operated for 267 d showed excellent tss removal (>90%) which occurred primarily near the inlet, and that cod removal was maximized at lower hrts (e.g., 56% removal efficiency and 25 g of cod removed per m(3) of bioreactor per data 24 h hrt). however, influent wastewater took progressively longer to move into the woodchips likely due to a combination of (1) woodchip settling, (2) clogging due to removed wastewater solids and/or accumulated bacterial growth, and (3) the pulsed flow system pushing the chips away from the inlet. the bioreactor that received the highest loading rate experienced the most altered hydraulics. statistically significant increases in woodchip p content over time in woodchip bags placed near the bioreactor outlets (0.03 vs 0.10%p2o5) and along the bioreactor floor (0.04 vs. 0.12%p2o5) confirmed wastewater solids were being removed and may pose a concern for subsequent nutrient mineralization and release. nevertheless, the excellent nitrate-nitrogen and tss removal along with notable cod removal indicated woodchip bioreactors are a viable water treatment technology for these types of wastewaters given they are used downstream of a filtration device.

computer-aided_design	sinus augmentation procedure has been demonstrated to be a highly predictable treatment in posterior maxilla atrophy. all the surgical interventions in the maxillary region require deep knowledge of anatomy and possible anatomical variations. in this article, pre-operative and post-operative assessments of sinus cavity as well as novel approaches to deepen our knowledge of the behavior of bone substitute materials are described. the awareness of the patient 's morphologic conditions enables exact planning of invasive surgery and aids to avoid complications. pre-operative radiologic evaluation of the region before sinus lift is advisable both for a planning of the sinus augmentation and for selection and alignment of the optimum placement of implants. on the orthopantomography it is possible to measure the vertical dimension of graft, but not the volume and 3d changes. cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) has become the ""gold standard"" to plan a comprehensive implant treatment and to achieve a post-operative assessment. a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) technique is proposed to produce custom-made block grafts for sinus lift procedure, and a customized cutting guide to accurately place the lateral wall and ease membrane elevation. this procedure allows to reduce intervention time, to precisely adapt the scaffold, to reduce risk of complications and to improve operation quality. recently, a novel approach has been used to deepen our knowledge of the behavior of bsbs: by means of synchrotron micro-tomography (sct). it is a 3-d analyzing method, suitable to examine the dynamic and spatial arrangement of regenerative phenomena in complex anatomical structures such as bone, where tissues with several morphologies (alveolar process, unmineralized extracellular matrix, regenerated vessels, etc.) compete to achieve the final goal of bone regeneration.
genetics	background: understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to high altitude life is of paramount importance for preserving and managing genetic diversity in highland animals. this objective has been addressed mainly in terrestrial fauna but rarely in aquatic animals. tibetan schizothoracinae fish is the ideal model system in evolutionary biology, carrying key insights into evolutionary genetics of speciation and adaptation at high altitude. gymnocypris przewalskii is the newly formed schizothoracinae fish species in the tibetan plateau, inhabits chronic cold, extreme saline and alkaline aquatic environment in lake qinghai, thus evolving the unique genomic signatures to adapt extremely severe environments. results: to characterize its genomic features, we assembled de novo transcriptome of g. przewalskii from lake qinghai. intriguingly, by comparative genomic analyses of g. przewalskii and 8 other fish species, we identified potential expansions in gene families related to energy metabolism, transport and developmental functions, possibly underlying the adaptation to these environmental stresses. through comprehensive molecular evolution analyses, we found that sets of genes controlling mitochondrion, ion homoeostasis, acid-base balance and innate immunity show significant signals of positive selection. compared to previous studies on highland fishes, we failed to identify any positively selected genes related to hypoxia response. conclusions: our findings provide comprehensive insights into the genetic basis of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme high altitude aquatic life on the tibetan plateau.
immunology	allogenic lymphocyte immunotherapy (lit) as a treatment for unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (ursa) is still controversial due to the lack of enough controls to evaluate its effectiveness. eighteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials with lit for ursa were included in the meta-analysis. live birth rates for each group were extracted, and the overall odds ratio (or) for lit was calculated. the success rate of treatment group was significantly higher (or 3.74, 95% ci 3.07 similar to 4.57). lit performed before and during pregnancy had dramatically improved the live birth rate in women with ursa (or 4.67, 95% ci 3.70 similar to 5.90). the overall or was 5.25 (95% ci 4.16 similar to 6.64), which supports a low dose of lymphocytes for treating ursa. our results indicate that lit provides a significantly beneficial effect over placebo for ursa. lit given before and during pregnancy is superior to lit given only before pregnancy, and the lower doses per treatment (less than 100 x 10(6) lymphocytes or 100 ml peripheral blood) achieved a better outcome.
fluid_mechanics	in fluid mechanics, a lot of authors have been executing their researches to obtain the analytical solutions of navier-stokes equations, even for 3d case of compressible gas flow or 3d case of non-stationary flow of incompressible fluid. but there is an essential deficiency of non-stationary solutions indeed. we explore the ansatz of derivation of non-stationary solution for the navier-stokes equations in the case of incompressible flow, which was suggested earlier. in general case, such a solution should be obtained from the mixed system of 2 riccati ordinary differential equations (in regard to the time-parameter t). but we find an elegant way to simplify it to the proper analytical presentation of exact solution (such a solution is exponentially decreasing to zero for t going to infinity infinity). also it has to be specified that the solutions that are constructed can be considered as a class of perturbation absorbed exponentially as t going to infinity infinity by the null solution.
polymerase_chain_reaction	exosomes secreted from the cell to the extracellular environment play an important role in intercellular communication. next-generation sequencing technology, which has achieved great development recently, allows us to detect more complete data and gain even deeper analyses of rna transcriptomes. in our research, we extracted exosomes from different gastric cancer cell lines and immortalized normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line and examined the amounts of exosomal proteins and rnas. our data showed that the secreted amount of cancer cell-derived exosomes, which contain proteins and rnas, was much higher than that of normal cell-derived exosomes. moreover, next-generation sequencing technology confirmed the presence of small non-coding rnas in exosomes. based on publicly available databases, we classified small non-coding rnas. according to the microrna profiles of exosomes, hsa-mir-21-5p and hsa-mir-30a-5p were two of the most abundant sequences among all libraries. the expression levels of the two micrornas, mir-100 and mir-148a, in exosomes were validated through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction result, consistent with the trend of sequencing result, indicated a significant difference in exosomes between gastric cancer and gastric mucosal epithelial cell lines. we also predicted novel microrna candidates but they need to be validated. this research provided an atlas of small noncoding rna in exosomes and may make a little contribution to the understanding of exosomal rna composition and finding parts of differential expression of rnas in exosomes.
northern_blotting	previous studies in our laboratory have shown that one of the earliest events during hepatocarcinogenesis in the albumin sv40 t antigen (alb sv40 t ag) transgenic rat is the duplication of chromosome 1q3.7-4.3, a region which contains the imprinted and coordinately regulated genes lgf2 and h19. we have also shown that this duplication is associated with the biallelic expression of the normally monoallelically-expressed h19. these results, however, are seemingly at odds with studies in the mouse that have shown a conservation of fetal regulatory patterns of these two genes in hepatic neoplasms. we therefore aimed in this study to determine the allelic origin of lgf2 expression in hepatocellular carcinomas of the ab sv40 t ag transgenic rat. sprague-dawley alb sv40 t ag transgenic rats and brown norway rats were reciprocally mated and the expression of lgf2 in hepatocellular carcinomas of the resulting f, transgene-positive female rats was analyzed by northern blotting and rt-pcr. we determined that lgf2 was expressed exclusively from the paternal allele, which prompted the study (by the same methods) of the allelic origin of h19 in the same hepatocellular carcinomas in order to determine if the two genes remained coordinately regulated. our results demonstrate fetal-like re-expression of lgf2 and deregulation of h19 in singular hepatocellular carcinomas of the rat. these results imply that another regulatory mechanism other than the generally accepted icr/ctcf mechanism may play a role in the control of lgf2 and h19 expression.

manufacturing_engineering	resource consumption accounting (rca) is a major innovation in manufacturing management accounting. it combines activity-based costing and marginal cost elasticity of germany. rca can be used to the analysis and management of e / i production, the basis for budget of project, and provide evidence for sub-projects and sub-contract.
enzymology	biocatalysis currently is focusing on enzymatic and multi-enzymatic cascade processes instead of single steps imbedded into chemical pathways. alongside this scientific revolution, this review provides an overview on multi-enzymatic cascades that are responsible for the biosynthesis of some terpenes, alkaloids and polyethers, which are important classes of natural products. herein, we illustrate the development of studies inspired by multi- and chemo-enzymatic approaches to build the core moieties of polyethers, polypeptide alkaloids, piperidines and pyrrolidines promoted by the joint action of oxidoreductases, hydrolases, cyclases, transaminases and imine reductases.

thermodynamics	an isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model with a source of dark energy is studied. that source is simulatedwith a viscous relativistic fluidwith minimal causal correction. in this model the restrictions on the parameters coming from the following conditions are analized: (a) energy density without singularities along time, (b) scale factor increasing with time, (c) universe accelerated at present time, (d) state equation for dark energy with ""omega"" bounded and close to -1. it is found that those conditions are satisfied for the following two cases. (i) when the transport coefficient (tau(pi)), associated to the causal correction, is negative, with the additional restriction zeta |tau(pi)| >2/3, where. is the relativistic bulk viscosity coefficient. the state equation is in the ""phantom"" energy sector. (ii) for tau(pi) positive, in the ""k-essence"" sector. it is performed an exact calculation for the case where the equation of state is constant, finding that option (ii) is favored in relation to (i), because in (ii) the entropy is always increasing, while this does no happen in (i).
southern_blotting	few naturally-occurring plasmids are maintained in mammalian cells. among these are genomes of gamma-herpesviruses, including epstein-barr virus (ebv) and kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), which cause multiple human malignancies(1-3). these two genomes are replicated in a licensed manner, each using a single viral protein and cellular replication machinery, and are passed to daughter cells during cell division despite their lacking traditional centromeres(4-8). much work has been done to characterize the replications of these plasmid genomes using methods such as southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). these methods are limited, though. quantitative pcr and southern blots provide information about the average number of plasmids per cell in a population of cells. fish is a single-cell assay that reveals both the average number and the distribution of plasmids per cell in the population of cells but is static, allowing no information about the parent or progeny of the examined cell. here, we describe a method for visualizing plasmids in live cells. this method is based on the binding of a fluorescently tagged lactose repressor protein to multiple sites in the plasmid of interest(9). the dna of interest is engineered to include approximately 250 tandem repeats of the lactose operator (laco) sequence. laco is specifically bound by the lactose repressor protein (laci), which can be fused to a fluorescent protein. the fusion protein can either be expressed from the engineered plasmid or introduced by a retroviral vector. in this way, the dna molecules are fluorescently tagged and therefore become visible via fluorescence microscopy. the fusion protein is blocked from binding the plasmid dna by culturing cells in the presence of iptg until the plasmids are ready to be viewed. this system allows the plasmids to be monitored in living cells through several generations, revealing properties of their synthesis and partitioning to daughter cells. ideal cells are adherent, easily transfected, and have large nuclei. this technique has been used to determine that 84% of ebv-derived plasmids are synthesized each generation and 88% of the newly synthesized plasmids partition faithfully to daughter cells in hela cells. pairs of these ebv plasmids were seen to be tethered to or associated with sister chromatids after their synthesis in s-phase until they were seen to separate as the sister chromatids separated in anaphase(10). the method is currently being used to study replication of kshv genomes in hela cells and slk cells. hela cells are immortalized human epithelial cells, and slk cells are immortalized human endothelial cells. though slk cells were originally derived from a kshv lesion, neither the hela nor slk cell line naturally harbors kshv genomes(11). in addition to studying viral replication, this visualization technique can be used to investigate the effects of the addition, removal, or mutation of various dna sequence elements on synthesis, localization, and partitioning of other recombinant plasmid dnas.
machine_design	this paper presents the design of a high-performance 14-pole, 12-slot interior permanent magnet synchronous machine with flux barriers inside the stator iron core and fractional-slot concentrated windings. this work focuses on electromagnetic, mechanical and thermal aspects of the machine design. the specific goal of this work was to design an electrical machine, which will have a small size, high power-to-weight ratio, high efficiency, especially at part-load operating points, and high speed capability for traction drive applications. therefore the unconventional stator design is used. the proposed machine design was compared with the conventional one, concerning the magnetic saturation, spectrum of the magneto-motive force and produced torque. to ensure the high speed capability of the motor, the numerical structural analysis of the rotor is shown. temperature behavior inside of the designed motor at steady-state operating point is shown.
fluid_mechanics	demand for green energy production is arising all over the world. a lot of emphasis is laid in making the buildings green. even a small amount of energy savings made contribute to saving the environment. in this study, an idea is proposed and studied to extract power from the high head water in the pipelines of a building. a building of height 15 m is considered for this study. water flowing in the pipe has sufficient energy to run a micro hydro turbine. the feasibility of producing electrical energy from the energy of pipe water is found. the motivation is to find the feasibility of generating power using a low-cost turbine. the experimental setup consists of micro turbine of 135 mm diameter coupled to a 12-v dc generator; leds and resistors are employed to validate the results. the theoretical calculations were presented using the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. the theoretical results are validated using experimental and numerical results using cfd simulation. in addition, exergy analysis has been carried out to quantify the irreversibilities during the process in the system.
fluid_mechanics	finite element simulation of the mixed convection within porous square cavities for darcy-brinkmanforchheimer model has been carried out in the present work. the penalty optimization based galerkin finite element method is used to solve the partial differential equations of heat and fluid flow. bejan 's heatline concept has been employed to visualize the heat flow within the closed cavities based on the motion of the horizontal wall(s) (cases la-id) or vertical wall(s) (cases 2a-2c) involving isothermally hot bottom wall, cold side walls and insulated top wall for various fluids with prandtl number, pr-m = 0.026, 0.7 and 7.2, reynolds number, re = 10-100 and grashof number, gr = 10(3)-10(5). the higher permeability at da(m) >= 10(-3) leads to the enhanced buoyancy convection for all the cases. although the direction of the motion of wall(s) significantly influences the fluid flow field within the enclosure, due to the decoupling between the fluid and thermal fields at the low pe(m) (pe(m) = 0.26 and 2.6), conductive heat transfer occurs as seen from the end-to-end heatlines. it is also found that the overall heat transfer rates at the bottom wall (nu(b)) are identical for the cases 1a-id and cases 2a-2c at pr-m = 0.026, irrespective of gr and re at da(m) = 10(-2). at pr-m = 0.7 and 7.2, the convection dominant heat transfer occurs for all the cases for gr = 10(5), re = 10 and 100 and da(m) = 10(-2). the strong convective circulation cells are observed at pr-m = 0.7 and 7.2 for all the cases. the plume shaped isotherms are also observed along the centerline at pr-m = 7.2, re = 10, gr = 10(5) and da(m) = 10(-2) for all the cases. at pr-m = 7.2, gr = 10(5), da(m) = 10(-2) and. re = 100, the multiple convective heatline cells are observed for the cases la-id. it is observed that, the strengths of fluid and heat circulation cells are less at re = 100 compared to re = 10 for all the cases due to weak buoyancy force at the high re. in order to achieve the high heat transfer rate at the bottom wall (nu(b)) for the mixed convection involving various moving walls, case 2b (a case of the vertically moving wall) is preferred at pr-m = 0.7, re = 100, gr = 10(5) and da(m) = 10(-2). at the high pr-m (pr-m = 7.2, re = 100, gr = 105 and da(m) = 10(-2)), case 2a (a case of the vertically moving wall) is preferred based on the maximum heat transfer rate at the bottom wall (nu(b)).

immunology	prostate cancer (pca) has become the second leading cause of male cancer-related mortality in the united states. mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) are able to migrate to tumor tissues, and are thus considered to be novel antitumor carriers. however, due to their immunosuppressive nature, the application of mscs in pca therapy remains limited. in this study, we investigated the effect of mscs overexpressing an nad-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (mscs-sirt1) on prostate tumor growth, and we analyzed the underlying mechanisms. our results show that mscs accelerate prostate tumor growth, whereas mscs-sirt1 significantly suppresses tumor growth. natural killer (nk) cells and macrophages are the prominent antitumor effectors of the mscs-sirt1-induced antitumor activity. ifn-gamma and c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10 (cxcl10) are highly expressed in mscs-sirt1 mice. the antitumor effect of mscs-sirt1 is weakened when cxcl10 and ifn-gamma are inhibited. these results show that mscs-sirt1 can effectively inhibit prostate cancer growth recruiting nk cells and macrophages in a tumor inflammatory microenvironment.
hydraulics	hydraulic control with switching valves can excite undesirable hydraulic and mechanical oscillations; hence, control performance is inadequate. there are different ways to cope with such oscillations. one way is to change the design or to add some damping elements which improve the attenuation of the oscillations. another way is to actuate the system in an appropriate way - so that almost no unwanted oscillations are excited. this article illustrates that optimal feed-forward control theory can be used to obtain a realisable switching valve command which avoids ongoing oscillations for the case of a fast position step. a system composed of a dual-stroke cylinder with its piston chamber connected to the switching valves by some pipeline and its rod chamber to pre-pressurised accumulators for counterbalancing is modelled as a discrete dynamical system of order 9. the optimal control problem is conditioned such that the resulting valve signals can be approximately realised by the existing switching valves. for this realisation, the so-called ballistic mode of switching valves plays an important role. the theoretical results are tested experimentally on a proper test rig.
polymerase_chain_reaction	circular rnas are a special class of endogenous rnas characterized by jointing 3' and 5' ends together via exon or intron circularization. recent studies found that circular rnas are involved in the development of some human diseases. however, little is known about their roles in human gastric cancer. in this study, we chose hsa_circ_0001895 as a targeted circrna to investigate its clinical significances in gastric cancer patients. hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels in five gastric cancer cell lines and 257 specimens of tissues were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. then, the potential relationship between hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels and patients' clinicopathological factors was investigated. a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed for evaluating the diagnostic value of hsa_circ_0001895. hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels in five detected gastric cancer cell lines (ags, bgc-823, hgc-27, mgc-803, and sgc-7901) were all significantly downregulated than those in normal gastric epithelial ges-1 cells. besides, compared with healthy control tissues, it was downregulated not only in 69.8% (67/96) gastric cancer tissues but also in gastric precancerous lesions. moreover, hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels were significantly correlated with cell differentiation, borrmann type, and tissue carcino-embryonic antigen expression. our results suggested that hsa_circ_0001895 may play crucial roles during gastric cancerogenesis and is a potential biomarker for clinical prognosis prediction.
southern_blotting	intracellular delivery of a functional gene or a nucleic acid sequence to specifically knockdown a harmful gene is a potential approach to precisely treat a critical human disease. the intensive efforts in the last few decades led to the development of a number of viral and non-viral synthetic vectors. however, an ideal delivery tool in terms of the safety and efficacy has yet to be established. recently, we have developed ph-sensing inorganic nanocrystals of carbonate apatite for efficient and cell-targeted delivery of gene and gene-silencing rna. here we show that addition of very low level of fluoride to the particle-forming medium facilitates a robust increase in transgene expression following post-incubation of the particles with hela cells. confocal microscopic observation and southern blotting prove the cytoplasmic existence of plasmid dna delivered by likely formed fluoridated carbonate apatite particles while degradation of plasmid dna presumably by cytoplasmic nucleases was noticed following delivery with apatite particles alone. the beneficial role of fluoride in enhancing carbonate apatite-mediated gene expression might be due to the buffering potential of generated fluoridated apatite in endosomal acidic environment, thereby increasing the half-life of delivered plasmid dna.

enzymology	some cancers have been shown to have a higher temperature than surrounding normal tissue. this higher temperature is due to heat generated internally in the cancer. the higher temperature of cancer (compared to surrounding tissue) enables a thermodynamic analysis to be carried out. here i show that there is increased entropy production in cancer compared with surrounding tissue. this is termed excess entropy production. the excess entropy production is expressed in terms of heat flow from the cancer to surrounding tissue and enzymic reactions in the cancer and surrounding tissue. the excess entropy production in cancer drives it away from the stationary state that is characterised by minimum entropy production. treatments that reduce inflammation (and therefore temperature) should drive a cancer towards the stationary state. anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and also thyroxine analogues have been shown (using various criteria) to reduce the progress of cancer.
cell_biology	recent studies have established resident memory t cells (t-rm) as the dominant memory lymphocyte population surveying most nonlymphoid tissues. unlike other memory t cell lineages, t-rm do not recirculate through blood and are permanently confined to their tissue of residence. t-rm orchestrate local immune responses and have been shown to accelerate local pathogen control in many experimental infection models. here we briefly summarize recent advances in t-rm differentiation, maintenance, and their protective function. while little is known, we have speculated on the potential implications of t-rm for transplantation biology. areas of emphasis include the role of passenger t-rm in controlling latent viral recrudescence in donor organs, donor t-rm as a source of graft-versus-host disease, the ability of t-rm to potently induce inflammation through sensing and alarm functions, and differentiation of host t cells into t-rm in response to local cues inside the allograft. further investigation of t-rm in the context of transplantation might identify therapeutic targets to prolong graft survival. this review discusses the phenotype, function, and potential relevance for transplantation of resident memory t cells.
enzymology	c-14-labeled nicotinamide cofactors are widely employed in biomedical investigations: for example, to delineate c-14-labeled nicotinamide cofactors are widely employed in biomedical investigations, for example, to delineate metabolic pathways, to elucidate enzymatic mechanisms, and as substrates in kinetic isotope effect (kie) experiments. the c-14 label has generally been located remote from the reactive position, frequently at the adenine ring. rising costs of commercial precursors and disruptions in the availability of enzymes required for established syntheses have recently made the preparation of labeled nicotinamides such as [ad-c-14]nadph unviable. here, we report the syntheses and characterization of several alternatives: [carbonyl-c-14]nadph, 4r-[carbonyl-c-14, 4-h-2]nadph, and [carbonyl-c-14, 4-h-2(2)]nadph. the new procedures use [carbonyl-c-14]nicotinamide as starting material, because it is significantly cheaper than other commercial c-14 precursors of nadph, and require only one commercially available enzyme to prepare nad(p)(+) and nad(p)h. the proximity of carbonyl-c-14 to the reactive center raises the risk of an inopportune c-14 isotope effect. this concern has been alleviated via competitive kie measurements with escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecdhfr) that use this specific carbonyl-c-14 nadph. a combination of binding isotope effect and kie measurements yielded no significant c-12/c-14 isotope effect at the amide carbonyl (kie = 1.003 +/- 0.004). the reported procedure provides a high-yield, high-purity, and cost-effective alternative to labeled nicotinamide cofactors synthesized by previously published routes.

enzymology	ghrelin-o-acyltransferase (goat) is an 11-transmembrane integral membrane protein that octanoylates the metabolism-regulating peptide hormone ghrelin at ser3 and may represent an attractive target for the treatment of type ii diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. protein octanoylation is unique to ghrelin in humans, and little is known about the mechanism of goat or of related protein-o-acyltransferases hhat or porc. in this study, we explored an in vitro microsomal ghrelin octanoylation assay to analyze its enzymologic features. measurement of k-m for 10-mer, 27-mer, and synthetic tat-peptide-containing ghrelin substrates provided evidence for a role of charge interactions in substrate binding. ghrelin substrates with amino-alanine in place of ser3 demonstrated that goat can catalyze the formation of an octanoyl-amide bond at a similar rate compared with the natural reaction. a ph-rate comparison of these substrates revealed minimal differences in acyltransferase activity across ph 6.0-9.0, providing evidence that these reactions may be relatively insensitive to the basicity of the substrate nucleophile. the conserved his338 residue was required both for ser3 and amino-ala3 ghrelin substrates, suggesting that his338 may have a key catalytic role beyond that of a general base.

hydraulics	neutral beam injection (nbi) is a high-power auxiliary heating system for the east device. we present a thermal shield (ts) structure to protect the neck pipe of the east equatorial port to avoid damage from the nbi beam. since the east port has a big trumpet structure, a straight section, and a small trumpet structure, to accommodate the port structure, a ts concept is put forward including its cooling system. the cooling loops and the sub-branches were designed with interfaces between the inner cooling branches. the heat removal capability is verified by a thermal hydraulics analysis based on ansys code. in particular, fabrication is addressed with technical processing technology, especially for the embedded cooling pipes in the heat sinks. the pipes are checked for leaks after bending and the embedding processing. the assembly activities are demonstrated in the spatial space zones of the port before the engineering installation. it is confirmed that the ts structure is safe and will run feasibly in the east discharge. it is indicated that the ts structure can provide thermal shielding and remove heat for the nbi device in the port region.
computer-aided_design	computer-aided process planning is an important component for linking design and manufacturing in computer-aided design/computer-aided process planning/computer-aided manufacturing integrated manufacturing systems. operation sequencing in computer-aided process planning is one of the most essential tasks. to solve the problem and acquire optimal process plans, operation sequencing is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with various constraints, and a novel modified ant colony optimization algorithm is developed to solve it. to ensure the feasibility of process plans, constrained relationships considered among operations are classified into two categories called precedence constraint relationships and clustering constraint relationships. operation precedence graph based on constrained relationships is formed to get visual representation. to ensure good manufacturing economy, in the mathematical model for optimization, total weighted production cost or weighted resource transformation time related to machine changes, setup changes, tool changes, machines and tools is utilized as the evaluation criterion. to avoid local optimum and enhance global search ability, adaptive updating method and local search mechanism are embedded into the optimization algorithm. case studies of three parts are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the modified ant colony optimization algorithm, and some comparisons between the modified ant colony optimization algorithm and previous genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, tabu search and particle swarm optimization algorithm are discussed. the results show that the modified ant colony optimization algorithm performs well in the operation sequencing problem.
human_metabolism	background: numerous diseases have been related with free radicals overproduction and oxidative stress. botanical preparations possess a multitude of bioactive properties, including antioxidant potential, which has been mainly related with the presence of phenolic compounds. however, the mechanisms of action of these phytochemicals, in vivo effects, bioavailability and bio-efficacy still need research. scope and approach: the present report aims to provide a critical review on the aspects related with the in vivo antioxidant activity of phenolic extracts and compounds from plant origin. key findings: biological functions beyond the human metabolism were discussed, comparing in vivo vs. in vitro studies, as also focusing the conditioning factors for phenolic compounds bioavailability and bioefficacy. furthermore, an upcoming perspective about the use of phytochemicals as life expectancy promoters and anti-aging factors in human individuals was provided. conclusions: overall, and despite all of those advances, the study of the biological potential of numerous natural matrices still remains a hot topic among the scientific community. in fact, the available knowledge about the responsible phytochemicals for the biological potential, their mechanisms of action, the establishment of therapeutic and prophylactic doses, and even the occurrence of biochemical interrelations, is considerable scarce.

northern_blotting	several studies have reported previously that acute myeloid leukemia (aml) may express wt1 detected by rt-pcr and/or northern blotting. the diagnostic utility of wt1 expression in aml using immunohistochemistry has not been reported previously. paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 55 aml, 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), and 10 normal bone marrow specimens were immunostained for wt1 (anti-n terminus antibody). 22/55 aml cases (40%) demonstrated nuclear immunopositivity for wt1, including 20/47 bone marrow trephines and 2/4 granulocytic sarcomas. all the all and normal bone marrow specimens were negative. a significant proportion of aml expresses nuclear immunostaining for wt1, a finding that has only been described previously in wilms' tumor and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. this finding is important for the correct interpretation of immunohistochemical findings in the diagnosis of ""small round cell'' tumors of childhood, especially in cases of extramedullary deposits of aml, in which traditional myeloid markers may be negative.
internal_combustion_engine	the paper presents a proof-of-principle study for the simultaneous imaging of temperature and fuel partial density in a realistic diesel spray using tracer-based planar laser-induced fluorescence (tracer-plif). the fluorescence of 1-methylnaphthalene (1-mn) is characterized in a flow cell with respect to temperature and pressure in nitrogen atmosphere at ic engine conditions with excitation at 266 nm. the strong spectral red-shift of 1-mn with increasing temperature is used for two-color-lif. the fuel partial density is determined with only one detection channel. this technique is further applied for investigation of temperature and fuel partial density in a diesel spray studied at 5 mpa and 800 k in an injection chamber. averaged images are presented for a pilot injection revealing a maximum temperature difference between fuel jet and ambience of about 150 k with a maximum fuel partial density of about 220 g/m(3). between 1300 and 1700 mu s after visible start of injection, the mixing temperature increases by up to 50 k and the fuel partial density decreases by about 20 g/m(3) because of gas entrainment. the suitability of the lif technique for single-shot measurements is further demonstrated by studying the cyclic spray variations, which allows for a detailed understanding of mixture formation in ic engine combustion. this enhanced tracer-based lif-technique for the first time allows for a simultaneous quantification of temperature and fuel partial density at elevated temperatures, which are highly relevant for diesel engines.

internal_combustion_engine	the biogas fired tri-generation system for cooling, heating and electricity generation (bcchp + pv) supported by a photovoltaic system (pv) is discussed and analyzed from energetic and ecological effectiveness point of view. analyzed system is based on the internal combustion engine and the adsorption machine. for the evaluation of primary energy savings in the bcchp aided by pv system, the indicators of the total primary energy savings (tpes) and relative primary energy savings apes were defined. also an analysis is carried out of the reduction of greenhouse gases emission. in the ecological potential evaluation, the environmental impact as an indicator of the total greenhouse gasses reduction (tghgr).is taken into account. the presented detailed algorithm for the evaluation of the multigeneration system in the global balance boundary can be applied for the analysis of energy effects (consumption of primary energy) as well as ecological effect (emission of greenhouse gasses) for real data (e.g. hour by hour through the year of operation) taking into account random availability of renewable energy. it allows to take into account a very important factor characterized for renewable energy systems (res) which is the variability or random availability (e.g. in the case of photovoltaic-pv) of primary energy. particularly in the presented work the effects of the analysis and the application of the discusses algorithms have been demonstrated for the hour-by-hour availability of solar radiation and for the daily changing availability of chemical energy of biogas. additionally, the energy and ecological evaluation algorithms have been integrated with the methods offered by exergy analysis. in the case of cogeneration systems there is a problem of the allocation of fuel between useful products (heat and electricity). the commonly applied methods of ""energetic division"" do n't take into account different quality of products generated in the cogeneration unit. moreover, these methods require subjective assumptions and it can lead in some cases to non-physical results of fuel allocation. it is commonly known that exergy losses decide on the amount of consumed energy driving the production process. if in the considered process two or more products are generated these losses should be proportionally allocated between these products. for this reason the correct allocation also should be done with the application of the exergetic allocation, what has been proposed in the algorithm presented in the paper.

cell_biology	aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the self-assembling peptide nanofibre scaffolds (sapns) on the growth, proliferation and retinal neuronal differentiation of the stem/progenitor cells (scs) derived from the ciliary pigment epithelium (cpe) of human cadaveric eye. here sapns (rada16-i, pm), which is well described in previous studies, commercially available and xeno-free. the cpe cells isolated were cultured in dmem/f12 supplemented with n2 and growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor, encapsulated in the scaffolds. the entrapped scs actively expanded and formed clone-like clusters in the scaffolds. many cells in the cluster were proliferating, as revealed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine uptake and could be maintained for up to 6 days and expressed neural progenitor markers such as beta-iii tubulin, nestin, pax6 and musashi1. upon differentiation of these cells in conditioned medium, the cells exhibited retinal neuronal markers such as s-opsin, rhodopsin and recoverin. the rt2 profiler polymerase chain reaction array experiments showed selective gene expression, possibly involved in neural stem/progenitor cell adhesion and differentiation. these findings suggest the suitability of the three-dimensional culture system for the proliferation and maintenance of cpe stem/progenitor cells (cpe-ns) and for possible use in ex vivo studies of small molecules, drug deliveries for retinal diseases and for use in combination with directed stem/progenitor cell differentiation. and ultimately for tissue replacement therapies. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
materials_engineering	this paper presents the design and implementation of the electrical system intended for powering and ignition of the plasma burner of the type metallurgical furnaces. furnace itself is developed and realized on the grounds of the vsb-tu ostrava, faculty of metallurgy and materials engineering, together with the faculty of electrical engineering and computer science, the department of electrical power engineering kat410.
fluid_mechanics	purpose: besides ventricular parameters, the design and angular orientation of a prosthetic heart valve induce a specific flow field. the aim of this study was to know the inflow characteristics of a left ventricular model (lvm), investigating the behavior of tricuspid bioprosthetic mitral valves in terms of velocity profiles and related valve aperture areas at the beginning of diastole, under different conditions. methods: 3 heart rates (hrs) were established in the lvm and each mitral bioprosthesis (27 and 31 mm diameter) was installed in 2 orientations, rotated by 180 degrees. for each experimental setup, 2-dimensional particle image velocimetry (2d piv) measurements and simultaneous mitral valve (mv) area detection were obtained from 50 samples. results: the results from the velocity profiles immediately downstream of mitral bioprostheses showed the influence of valve orientation for moderate hrs, although for a similar magnitude of mean velocity vectors. the geometries of mv open areas for each hr were similar regardless of valve orientation, except for the 27-mm valve at 90 beats per minute (bpm), and for the 31-mm valve at 60 bpm. moreover, for each hr, similar percentages of valve open area were obtained regardless of mv nominal diameters. conclusions: in conclusion, the experimental setup for the 2d piv measurements synchronized with the mv area detection was a useful tool for knowing the inflow characteristics of the lvm.
machine_design	analytical calculation methods for all the major components of the synchronous inductance of tooth-coil permanent-magnet synchronous machines are reevaluated in this paper. the inductance estimation is different in the tooth-coil machine compared with the one in the traditional rotating field winding machine. the accuracy of the analytical torque calculation highly depends on the estimated synchronous inductance. despite powerful finite element method (fem) tools, an accurate and fast analytical method is required at an early design stage to find an initial machine design structure with the desired performance. the results of the analytical inductance calculation are verified and assessed in terms of accuracy with the fem simulation results and with the prototype measurement results.
human_metabolism	lipoprotein(a), a variant of ldl carrying the adhesive glycoprotein apo(a), is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. lipoprotein(a) (lp(a)) is found in humans and subhuman primates but rarely in lower mammals. better understanding of the evolutionary advantage of this molecule should elucidate its physiological role. we developed a new mouse model with two characteristics of human metabolism: the expression of lp(a) and the lack of endogenous ascorbate (vitamin c) production. we show that dietary deficiency of ascorbate increases serum levels of lp(a). moreover, chronic hypoascorbemia and complete depletion of ascorbate (scurvy) leads to lp(a) accumulation in the vascular wall and parallels atherosclerotic lesion development. the results suggest that dietary ascorbate deficiency is a risk factor for atherosclerosis independent of dietary lipids. we provide support for the concept that lp(a) functions as a mobile repair molecule compensating for the structural impairment of the vascular wall, a morphological hallmark of hypoascorbemia and scurvy.
immunology	the commonality of antibiotic usage in medicine means that understanding the resulting consequences to the host is vital. antibiotics often decrease host microbiome community diversity and alter the microbial community composition. many diseases such as antibiotic-associated enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders have been linked to a disrupted microbiota. the complex interplay between host, microbiome, and antibiotics needs a tractable model for studying host-microbiome interactions. our freshwater vertebrate fish serves as a useful model for investigating the universal aspects of mucosal microbiome structure and function as well as analyzing consequential host effects from altering the microbial community. methods include host challenges such as infection by a known fish pathogen, exposure to fecal or soil microbes, osmotic stress, nitrate toxicity, growth analysis, and measurement of gut motility. these techniques demonstrate a flexible and useful model system for rapid determination of host phenotypes.
immunology	hyperglycemia is the most prominent sign that characterizes diabetes. hyperglycemia favors malignant cell growth by providing energy to cancer cells. clinical studies also showed an increased risk of diabetes being associated with different types of cancers. in addition, poorly regulated glucose metabolism in diabetic patients is often found with increased levels of chronic inflammatory markers, e.g., interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and emerging evidence has highlighted activation of the immune response in the progression and development of cancer cells. therefore, uncontrolled proinflammatory responses could conceivably create a chronic inflammatory state, promoting a tumor-favorable microenvironment and potentially triggering immune overactivation and cancer growth. to further understand how hyperglycemia contributes to immune overactivation, the tumor microenvironment and the development of chronic inflammation-associated tumors may provide insights into tumor biology and immunology. this paper provides a brief introduction to hyperglycemia-associated diseases, followed by a comprehensive overview of the current findings of regulatory molecular mechanisms of glycosylation on proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix under hyperglycemic conditions. then, the authors discuss the role of hyperglycemia in tumorigenesis (particularly in prostate, liver, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers), as well as the contribution of hyperglycemia to chronic inflammation. the authors end with a brief discussion on the future perspectives of hyperglycemia/tumorigenesis and potential applications of alternative effective therapeutic strategies for hyperglycemia-associated cancers.

enzymology	a simple immobilization method for candida rugosa lipase on superparamagnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles is described. the fe3o4 nanoparticles were coated with pei and candida rugosa lipase was adsorbed on these particles via electrostatic interactions. the immobilization resulted in marginal simultaneous purification. however, the immobilized preparation showed 110x higher transesterification activity in low-water media. it was also efficient in kinetic resolution of (+/-)-1-phenylethanol with ee(p) of 99 % and e=412 within 24 h.
cell_biology	background: recent advances in our basic knowledge of the tissue damage and regeneration pathology have combined with a remarkable progress in stem cell biology so the prospect of clinical tissue repair strategies is a tangible reality. we tried to describe a better view about mesenchymal stem cell (msc) mechanisms in wound healing and tissue regeneration, sending any ideas for next advanced therapies. content: sustaining injury, whether minor or major, is part of every organism life. therefore, efficient response mechanisms to damage have developed. wound healing is a perplexing multi-step processes which can be divided into three major phases: inflammation, proliferation, and scar formation/remodeling. though the compartementalization of this process into discrete stages give the illusion of simplicity, but in reality it is much more complicated. so that efficient healing can occur, complex interactions between multiple cell types, soluble factors and extracellular matrix components are required to rebuild the tissue. even under optimal conditions, the healing process drives to fibrosis or scar. the latest technology that makes a huge difference in the wound healing process is stem cell therapy, which offers a novel approach to many diseases. summary: wound healing therapies continue to rapidly evolve, with advances in basic science and engineering research heralding the development of new therapies, as well as ways to modify existing treatments. stem cell-based therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic concepts for wound healing. advances in stem cell biology have enabled researchers and clinicians alike with access to cells capable of actively modulating the healing response.
cell_biology	estuarine and marine ecosystems are subject to different sources of stress including changes in environmental physicochemical variables (nutrients, oxygen availability, temperature, salinity, ph) or exposure to a large cocktail of environmental pollutants. in the estuary of bilbao, despite the improvement in environmental quality due to replacement of most polluting industries and the progressive implementation of an integrated sewage treatment plan, chronic pollution by metals and hydrocarbons still remains, together with eutrophication and pollution by emerging contaminants. the unit of formation and research ""protection of ecosystem health"" was created in 2012 through the strategic aggregation of three consolidated research groups: cell biology in environmental toxicology (cbet), phytoplankton of estuaries and coastal areas (fiteac) and research on marine and estuarine pelagic environment and planktonic communities (maresplank). the three groups have a long tradition in studying the health of marine and estuarine ecosystems from different perspectives, focusing in the bay of biscay and especially in the estuary of bilbao. in this work we review data on the health status of the bilbao estuary using early warning tools at the cell and tissue levels, phytoplankton assemblages and zooplankton ecology. in spite of the seasonal and interannual variability recorded for some parameters, a general recovery trend was observed for the health status in the estuary of bilbao, with sporadic critical events such as the prestige oil spill.

molecular_biology	soybean oil is an important carbon source in kitasamycin fermentation by streptomyces kitasatoensis. in this study, three different surfactants, tween 80, tween 85, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds), were added in the fermentation medium to improve soybean oil utilization. results indicated that all of these surfactants promote kitasamycin biosynthesis. when 0.5 g/l sds was added at the beginning of fermentation, kitasamycin production increased by 55% and a(5) content improved by 12%, compared with the control treatment (i.e., no surfactant added). oil consumption rate and lipase activity were also improved in the presence of sds, producing more organic acids benefiting kitasamycin biosynthesis. high butyric acid concentration in the fermentation medium containing sds repressed c-3 acetylation and promoted a(5) component accumulation. additionally, utilization of oil components by s. kitasatoensis was altered. specifically, linoleic acid was primarily used in the fermentation process with sds, whereas oleic acid was primarily used in the fermentation process where no surfactant had been added.

thermodynamics	a low-dimensional model that describes both saturated and unsaturated flow processes in a single equation is presented. subsurface flow processes in the groundwater, the vadose zone, and the capillary fringe are accounted for through the computation of aggregated hydrodynamic parameters that result from the integration of the governing flow equations from the bedrock to the land surface. the three-dimensional subsurface flow dynamics are thus described by a two-dimensional equation, allowing for a drastic reduction of model unknowns and simplification of the model parameterizations. this approach is compared with a full resolution of the richards equation in different synthetic test cases. because the model reduction stems from the vertical integration of the flow equations, the test cases all use different configurations of heterogeneity for vertical cross-sections of a soil-aquifer system. the low-dimensional flow model shows strong consistency with results from a complete resolution of the richards equation for both the water table and fluxes. the proposed approach is therefore well suited to the accurate reproduction of complex subsurface flow processes.
machine_design	in this paper, a complete sensitivity analysis of the optimal parameters for the axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machines working in the field weakening region is implemented. thanks to the presence of a parameterized accurate analytical model, it is possible to obtain all the required parameters of the machine. the two goals of the ideal design are to maximize the power density: p-density and the ratio of maximal to rated speed: n(max)/n(r,) which is an inductance related parameter keeping the efficiency at the target speed above 90%. different slots/poles/phases combinations are studied to reveal the optimum combination for each phase. this paper has studied the effect of the ratio of number of stator slots to number of rotor poles on the p-density and n(max)/n(r). it is shown that a low value of this parameter results in a better p-density and n(max)/n(r). the effect of the outer diameter, and the inner to outer diameter ratio are studied with respect to the two design goals. in addition, a comparison between the finite and the theoretical infinite speed designs is implemented. a complete 3d finite element validation has proven the robustness of the analytical model.
internal_combustion_engine	about 20 years ago electromagnetic valve trains have been topic of many research projects in the automotive industry. despite promising approaches this technology had no chance to prevail on the market yet. in the meantime reinforced market restrictions are introduced and improved technical boundary conditions are available. the task of this project is to reevaluate the electromagnetic valve train (emvt) technology under these new circumstances. a dynamic simulation environment in dymola/modelica is created to be able to simulate the multidisciplinary system. this includes a magnetic, an electrical, a mechanical and a controller subsystem. the biggest challenge regarding the controller development is the high-dynamic valve movement. this is considered by implementing a repetitive learning feed forward controller developed in matalb/simulink/targetlink via a fmi interface into the simulation. the simulation shows that a concept based on a conventional spring mass system with additional lateral magnets is able to open the valves of an internal combustion engine and simultaneously has a sufficient impact on velocity control.
molecular_biology	serrated polyps have long been thought to lack malignant potential in the human colorectum. however, identification of the serrated pathway to colorectal cancer based on molecular biology has improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of colorectal cancers. accordingly, serrated polyps such as traditional serrated adenoma and sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (ssa/p) are now considered to be precursor lesions of the serrated pathway. recently, serrated polyps were classified into three subtypes, consisting of hyperplastic polyp, ssa/p, and traditional serrated adenoma, according to the world health organization classification. it has been suggested that ssa/p in the proximal colon are a precursor lesion of pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and are characterized by braf mutation and a cpg island methylator phenotype with or without microsatellite instability. however, ssa/p is more challenging to detect by colonoscopy and is likely to account for some interval cancers, particularly in the proximal colon because it presents flat or sessile, isochroous appearance, and occasionally has a mucous cap. furthermore, the possibility has been raised that pathologists misclassify ssa/p as hyperplastic polyp. it is important for gastroenterologists to recognize the endoscopic features of serrated polyps to facilitate their detection and removal and also to establish postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines. in this review, we discuss the recent classification of serrated polyps; the molecular characteristics of the serrated pathway; appropriate diagnostic methods using endoscopy, including a new image-enhanced endoscopic technique; and management of these lesions.
southern_blotting	as important forage crops, gramineous forage plants can also play role in improving natural environment, maintaining water and soil erosion with turfgrass plants together. using the particle bombardment transformation system nicotianamine synthase gene was introduced into the callus of lolium perenne. twenty transgenic ryegrass lines were obtained from 105 pieces of g418-resistant calli, giving a 5.15% transformation frequency. pcr and southern blotting analysis showed that target gene was integrated into the genome of the transgenic plants. transgenic plants displayed excellent drought resistant by expression of nashor gene in the field aridity experiment. the chlorophyll content of leaves in transgenic plant was higher than that of the controls in normal condition. the further observation infield experiment and identified resistance for these transgenic plants are underway.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) in oral fluids (of) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) is gaining increasing popularity. however, the different steps leading to a result have not been extensively evaluated. the aim of the present study was to examine the effect on the performance of qrt-pcr with different sampling materials, conditions of storage of the of, the need for centrifuging of, as well as to compare rna extraction methods and pcr mixes. for the assays, pen-based oral fluids were used, which were pooled and spiked in a serial dilution (up to genotype 10(circle) tcid50/ml) of type 1 prrsv isolate 3267. centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min resulted in an increase in sensitivity (1-2 pcr cycles) that was significant (p<0.05) at the lowest dilution tested. the trizol and magmax rna extraction methods gave the maximum sensitivity, lowest threshold cycle (ct), at equivalent virus concentrations. the agpath-id one-step rt-pcr kit pcr mix reagents were more sensitive for the detection of prrsv using a purified plasmid as standard, but lsi vetmax prrsv eu/na prrsv reagents resulted in a slightly better sensitivity with of (p <0.05). the present results may be useful to standardize protocols for optimizing detection of type i prrsv in of by qrt-pcr.

enzymology	plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites to defend themselves from pathogen attack, while pathogens have evolved to overcome plant defences by producing enzymes that degrade or modify these defence compounds. however, many compounds targeted by pathogen enzymes currently remain enigmatic. identifying host compounds targeted by pathogen enzymes would enable us to understand the potential importance of such compounds in plant defence and modify them to make them insensitive to pathogen enzymes. here, a proof of concept metabolomics-based method was developed to discover plant defence compounds modified by pathogens using two pathogen enzymes with known targets in wheat and tomato. plant extracts treated with purified pathogen enzymes were subjected to lc-ms, and the relative abundance of metabolites before and after treatment were comparatively analysed. using two enzymes from different pathogens the in planta targets could be found by combining relatively simple enzymology with the power of untargeted metabolomics. key to the method is dataset simplification based on natural isotope occurrence and statistical filtering, which can be scripted. the method presented here will aid in our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions and may lead to the development of new plant protection strategies.
machine_design	the selection of suitable working fluids for use in organic rankine cycles (orc) is strongly addicted to the intended application of the orc system. the design of the orc, the kind of heat source and the ambient condition has an influence on the performance of the organic rankine cycle and on the selection of the working fluid. it can come to a discrepancy between the best candidate from the thermodynamic point of view and the transformation into a real machine design. if an axial turbine design is considered for expansion and energy conversion within the orc, the vapor volume flow ratios within the expansion path, the pressure ratio and of course the number of stages have to be considered within the fluid selection process and for the design parameters. furthermore, environmental aspects have to be taken into account, e.g. the global warming potential (gwp) and the flammability of the selected fluid. this paper shows the results of the design and fluid selection process for an organic rankine cycle for application in a combined operation with a 2mw class industrial gas turbine. the gas turbine contains two radial compressor stages with an integrated intercooler. to further increase the thermal cycle efficiency, a recuperator has been implemented to the gas turbine cycle, which uses the exhaust gas waste heat to preheat the compressed air after the second compressor, before it enters the combustion chamber. the shaft power is generated by a three stage axial turbine, whereby the first stage is a convection cooled stage, due to a turbine inlet temperature of 1100 degrees c. to further increase the electrical efficiency and the power output of the energy conversion cycle, a combined operation with an organic rankine cycle is intended. therefore the waste heat from the gt compressor intercooler is used as first heat source and the waste heat of the exhaust gas after the recuperator as second heat source for the organic rankine cycle. it is intended that the orc fluid acts as heat absorption fluid within the compressor intercooler. due to these specifications for the orc, a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been performed to determine the optimal design parameter and the best working fluid for the orc, in order to obtain a maximum power output of the combined cycle. due to the twice coupling of the orc to the gt cycle, the heat exchange between the two cycles is bounded by each other and a detailed analysis of the coupled cycles is necessary. e.g. the ambient temperature has an enormous influence on the transferred heat from the intercooler to the orc cycle, which itself affects the heat transfer and temperatures of the transferable heat from the second heat source. thus, a detailed analysis by considering the ambient operation conditions has been performed, in order to provide a most efficient energy conversion system over a wide operation range. the performance analysis has shown that by application of an orc for a combined operation with the intercooled and recuperated gas turbine, the combined cycle efficiency can be increased, for a wide ambient conditions range, by more than 3 %pts. and the electrical power output by more than 10 %, in comparison to the stand alone intercooled and recuperated gas turbine.
manufacturing_engineering	in order to achieve rapid development process and reduce the time to market, new approaches have been investigated for automotive body assembly design. this research presents a prospective study about using plant digital mock up to support industrialization process and design reviews. the concept of digital lot (dlot) is introduced as a design object to validate a layout and assembly processes alternative in a collaborative way. the result is a better synchronization between manufacturing engineers and quick identification of key issues related to the future assembly process configuration.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: tick-borne haemoparasitic diseases (tbhds), caused by theileria, babesia, anaplasma and ehrlichia, are common in regions of the world where the distributions of host, pathogen and vector overlap. many of these diseases threaten livestock production and some also represent a concern to human public health. the primary aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the above-mentioned pathogens in a large number of blood samples (n = 1979) collected from sheep (n = 1727) and goats (n = 252) in turkey. a secondary aim was to assess the diagnostic sensitivity of a number of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests and the reverse line blotting (rlb) assay. dna samples were screened using species-specific pcr for the presence of theileria ovis, theileria sp. mk, t. lestoquardi, t. uilenbergi, t. luwenshuni, babesia ovis, anaplasma ovis and a. phagocytophilum while rlb was undertaken to test for the presence of all known theileria, babesia, anaplasma and ehrlichia species. the diagnostic sensitivity of these two approaches was then compared in terms of their ability to detect single species and mixed infections. results: overall, 84 and 74.43% of the small ruminants sampled were identified as hosting one or more pathogen(s) by species-specific pcr and rlb respectively. the presence of theileria sp. ot1, t. luwenshuni and t. uilenbergi in turkey was revealed for the first time while the presence of babesia motasi, b. crassa and t. separata in turkish small ruminants was confirmed using molecular methods. a high prevalence of mixed infection was evident, with pcr and rlb approaches indicating that 52.24 and 35.42% of animals were co-infected with multiple species, respectively. more than 80% of the mixed infections contained t. ovis and/or a. ovis. the rlb approach was found to be capable of detecting mixed infections with species such as theileria sp. ot1, theileria sp. ot3, t. separata, b. crassa and babesia spp. conclusion: the results indicated that pathogens causing tbhds are highly prevalent in sheep and goats in turkey. the diagnostic sensitivity of species-specific single pcr was generally higher than that of rlb. however, the latter approach was still capable of identifying a high proportion of individuals containing mixed-species infections. the use of species-specific single pcr is recommended to accurately estimate pathogen prevalence and to identify co-infected hosts.
molecular_biology	a total of similar to 38.6 million mortalities occur due to liver cancer annually, worldwide. although a variety of therapeutic methods are available, the efficacy of treatment at present is extremely limited due to an increased risk of malignancy and inherently poor prognosis of liver cancer. gene therapy is considered a promising option, and has shown notable potential for the comprehensive therapy of liver cancer, in keeping with advances that have been made in the development of cancer molecular biology. the present study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of the abilities of the hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein of newcastle disease virus (ndv), the pro-apoptotic factor apoptin from chicken anaemia virus, and the interferon- inducer interleukin-18 (il-18) in antagonizing liver cancer. therefore, a recombinant dna plasmid expressing the three exogenous genes, vp3, il-18 and hemagglutinin neuraminidase (hn), was constructed. flow cytometry, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and analysis of caspase-3 activity were performed in h22 cell lines transfected with the recombinant dna plasmid. in addition, 6-week-old c57bl/6 mice were used to establish a h22 hepatoma-bearing mouse model. mice tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. the results of the present study revealed that the recombinant dna vaccine containing the vp3, il-18 and hn genes inhibited cell proliferation and induced autophagy via the mitochondrial pathway in vivo and in vitro.
polymerase_chain_reaction	composite lymphomas (cls) are defined as two unrelated lymphomas occurring at the same time within the same tissue. the incidence of these tumors is low. of all possible combinations between lymphomas, the least frequent are the ones combining peripheral t-cell lymphoma (ptcl) and hodgkin lymphoma (hl). we recently identified five cases of cl composed of ptcl and classical hl, mixed cellularity type. we investigated histological and clinical features of these cases. immunostaining was performed on paraffin sections. ptcl cells were positive for cd8 and tia-1 in four of the five cases. hodgkin and reed-sternberg (hrs) cells were positive for cd30 and weakly positive for pax5 in all cases, positive for cd15 in three of five cases, positive for cd20 in one of five cases, and negative for eber. monoclonal rearrangement of the t-cell receptor (tcr) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (igh) genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using whole paraffin sections. we concluded more precisely the monoclonality of the igh rearrangement of hrs cells based on single-cell pcr for igh and dna sequencing analysis after laser microdissection of single cells in one case. hl can occur in cd8-positive and tia-1-positive ptcl. clinicians should recognize the possibility of these cl.
polymerase_chain_reaction	lung cancer is the most frequent cause of mortality in cancer patients; non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) accounts for similar to 80% of lung cancer cases. micrornas (mirnas) have been revealed to perform an important role in cancer development and progression. based on a custom mirna microarray analysis of patients with nsclc, mirna-615-3p (mir-615-3p) downregulation was identified in nsclc tissues compared with normal lung tissues, which suggested that mir-615-3p acted as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer. the overexpression of mir-615-3p was then validated using 40 pairs of nsclc and adjacent normal tissue samples using a taqman reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. in order to investigate the tumor suppressor function of mir-615-3p, the ectopic expression of mir-615-3p in the nsclc a549, h1299 and h1650 cell lines was established. the results revealed that overexpressed mir-615-3p markedly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in the 3 nsclc cell lines compared with the cells overexpressing the negative control sequence (nc). additional investigation revealed that mir-615-3p overexpression significantly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase in the a549, h1299 and h1650 cell lines compared with the cells overexpressing nc. finally, ectopic expression of mir-615-3p was found to repress the cell migration and invasion of the 3 lung cancer cell lines. the results of the present study demonstrate, for the first time, that mir-615-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in nsclc, and may be a novel potential molecular therapeutic target for patients with nsclc.
computer-aided_design	background: during microtia reconstruction, the intraoperative design of the cartilage framework is important for the appearance and symmetry of the bilateral auricles. templates (traditionally, the x-ray film template) are usually utilized to complete the task, which can provide cues regarding size, cranioauricular angle and positioning to the surgeons. with a combination of three-dimensional (3d) scanning and additive manufacturing (am) techniques, we utilized two different ear-shaped templates (sheet moulding and 3d templates) during the fabrication of 3d-customized autologous cartilage frameworks for auricle reconstruction. methods: forty unilateral microtia patients were included in the study. all the patients underwent auricle reconstruction using the tissue-expanding technique assisted by the new am templates. images were processed using computer-aided design software and exported to print two different am ear-shaped templates: sheet moulding and 3d. both templates were assisted by the 3d framework fabrication. the 3d images of each patient 's head were captured preoperatively using a 3d scanner. x-ray film templates were also made for the patients. the lengths and widths of the contralateral auricles, x-ray film and sheet moulding templates were measured in triplicate. the error of the template and the contralateral auricle were used to compare the accuracy between the two templates. results: between january and may 2014, 40 unilateral microtia patients aged 6-29 years were included in this study. all patients underwent auricle reconstruction using autogenous costal cartilage. the sterilized am templates were used to assist in the framework fabrication. the operative time was decreased by an average of 15 min compared with the method assisted by the x-ray film template. postoperative appearance evaluation (based on five indexes: symmetry, length, width, cranioauricular angle and the substructure of the reconstructed ear) was performed by both the doctors and the patients (or their parents). follow-up (ranging from 9 to 18 months) showed that all of the patients obtained satisfactory results with life-like 3d configuration and symmetric cranioauricular angle. the follow-up showed that no surgery-related complications occurred. comparing the accuracy of the x-ray film and sheet moulding templates, the average errors of length were 1.8 mm +/- 1.44 mm and 0.39 mm +/- 0.35 mm, respectively, and the average width errors were 1.32 mm +/- 0.88 mm and 0.3 mm +/- 0.47 mm, respectively. the new sheet moulding template was more accurate than the x-ray template. conclusions: the new sheet-moulding template is much more accurate than the traditional xray film template. framework fabrication assisted by accurate 3d and informative am templates contributed to individualized cartilage framework fabrication and satisfactory results.

enzymology	plp is well-regarded for its role as a coenzyme in a number of diverse enzymatic reactions. transamination, deoxygenation, and aldol reactions mediated by plp-dependent enzymes enliven and enrich deoxy sugar biosynthesis, endowing these compounds with unique structures and contributing to their roles as determinants of biological activity in many natural products. the importance of deoxy aminosugars in natural product biosynthesis has spurred several recent structural investigations of sugar aminotransferases. the structure of a pmp-dependent enzyme catalyzing the c-3 deoxygenation reaction in the biosynthesis of ascarylose was also determined. these studies, and the crystal structures they have provided, offer a wealth of new insights regarding the enzymology of plp/pmp-dependent enzymes in deoxy sugar biosynthesis. in this review, we consider these recent achievements in the structural biology of deoxy sugar biosynthetic enzymes and the important implications they hold for understanding enzyme catalysis and natural product biosynthesis in general. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phosphate enzymology.

genetics	background: a steadily increasing pattern of breast cancer mortality has been reported in south korea since the late 1980s. this paper explored the trends of educational inequalities of female breast cancer mortality between 1983 and 2012 in korea, and conducted age-period-cohort (apc) analysis by educational level. methods: age-standardized mortality rates of breast cancer per 100,000 person-years were calculated. relative index of inequality (rii) for breast cancer mortality was used as an inequality measure. apc analyses were conducted using the web tool for apc analysis provided by the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the u.s. national cancer institute. results: an increasing trend in breast cancer mortality among korean women between 1983 and 2012 was due to the increased mortality of the lower education groups (i.e., no formal education or primary education and secondary education groups), not the highest education group. the breast cancer mortality was higher in women with a tertiary education than in women with no education or a primary education during 1983-1992, and the reverse was true in 1993-2012. consequently, rii was changed from positive to negative associations in the early 2000s. the lower education groups had the increased breast cancer mortality and significant cohort and period effects between 1983 and 2012, whereas the highest group did not. conclusions: apc analysis by socioeconomic position used in this study could provide an important clue for the causes on breast cancer mortality. the long-term monitoring of socioeconomic patterning in breast cancer risk factors is urgently needed.
hydraulics	utilisation of submerged vanes in front of intake ports is an effective approach to address sedimentation in lateral intakes from rivers. strategically installed, these flow-training structures could increase the mid-depth and near surface flows into the intake, and simultaneously prevent bed-load transport from entering the intake channels. the effectiveness of submerged vanes depends on their number, shape, dimensions and configuration. determination of optimum values for dimensions or configuration of the vanes is very challenging as the effect of many parameters, which are effective in sedimentation in the intake zone, must be investigated. in this study, effort has been made to determine appropriate dimensions of submerged vanes that are installed in front of a 90 degrees intake from a straight channel. fuzzy topsis, a multi-objective optimisation method, has been utilised for the optimisation process by considering ten parameters. the simulations have been conducted for three discharge ratios of 0.11, 0.16 and 0.21. the results show that a height of 0.2 times the flow depth, and a length of four times the vane height are the appropriate dimensions for utilisation of submerged vanes in front of the lateral intakes from straight channels.
strength_of_materials	this paper describes the method of increasing the contact fatigue strength of materials intended for application in the production of gears. investigations were carried out on 41cralmo7 grade steel (closest equivalent: nitralloy 135m) by quenching and tempering or nitriding and double shot-peening. special emphasis should be placed on the combination of nitriding and shot-peening technologies. both nitriding and shot-peening were significantly modified and differ from the classical processes. nitriding was carried out in a way preventing the formation of a compound surface layer formed by nitrides epsilon and gamma. shot-peening was carried out as a double-stage operation with the help of a change of parameters. as a result of combining the modernized processes, a new technology was developed guaranteeing the possibility of attainment of the contact fatigue limit comparable with the limit obtained by carburizing or induction hardening. the paper describes the methodology and the experimental work, as well as the obtained values of contact fatigue strength. other surface parameters are also given, such as roughness, hardness, state and distribution of residual stresses.
northern_blotting	a full-length cdna of an immunogenic protein was cloned from a cdna library of the local egyptian cattle tick boophilus annulatus. antibodies raised against b. annulatus larval proteins were used to screen a cdna expression library. a 936 bp cloned fragment was sequenced and showed an open reading frame of 516 bp encoding a protein of 171 amino acids. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with protein data bank revealed that the sequence is related to a sequence isolated from the hard tick haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (hq05). southern blot analysis of b. annulatus genomic dna showed that the cloned cdna hybridized to double bands per restriction digest, suggesting that the cloned cdna is a double copy gene. amino acid analysis of the cloned gene revealed the presence of two casein kinase 11 phosphorylation sites in the n-terminal domain suggesting that this molecule may be involved in the signal transduction or gene expression pathways. rt-pcr and northern blotting revealed the presence of two isoforms of the ba05 gene in salivary glands and in the 3-day-old eggs. the cloned gene without the signal peptide, was expressed in escherichia coli under t7 promotor of pet-30b vector, and purified under denaturation conditions. the purified protein appeared as a single band on 12% sds-page with a molecular weight around 22.8 kda including the histidine tag of the vector. antibodies raised against the purified molecule were used to detect the b. annulatus homologue to the hq05 gene in whole tick, larvae and gut protein extracts. immunoblotting revealed the presence of this molecule ba05 only in whole tick and larval protein extracts and not in the gut protein extract. using the same antibodies, homologues to the ba05 gene were detected in other tick species as hyalomma dromedarii and rhipicephalus sp. but not in ornithodoros moubata.

molecular_biology	background: pim-3 kinase is a highly homologous serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. few studies have been conducted to define the role of pim-3 in solid tumors, especially in prostate cancer. the aim of this study was to define the role of pim-3 in development and prognosis of prostate cancer. material/methods: we collected specimens from 160 patients with prostate cancer, as well as 100 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. realtime polymerase chain reaction was used for the assessment of pim-3 expression at the rna level and western blot was used to quantify the pim-3 protein synthesis in 3 different cell lines. results: we found that pim-3 mrna expression in prostate cancer tissue was significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (p<0.05). accordingly, the protein level expression of pim-3 in prostate cancer cell lines was also significantly higher than that in control cells. in addition, the expression status of pim-3 mrna was significantly associated with pathological parameters such as pre-surgery prostate specific antigen, gleason score, pathological stage, and lymphoid metastasis. high expression of pim-3 also significantly decreased the survival rate of patients after surgery. conclusions: pim-3 expression is an important risk factor for prostate cancer; we are the first team to report pim-3 as a valuable biomarker in chinese.
human_metabolism	in this study, it was found that the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of musa basjoo flowers was a rich source of antioxidant, due to its high total phenolic contents and significant antioxidant activity. ten phenolic compounds were isolated from this plant. they are gallic acid (1), caffeic acid methyl ester (2), guaiacylglycerol (3), 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-acrylic acid 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methoxy carbonyl ethyl ester (4), thero-guaiacylglycerol 8-o-beta-d-glycopyranoside (5), quercitrin (6), buein (7), (2r, 3s)-5,7,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavanonol (8), isoquercitrin (9) and 1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-hepta-4e, 6e-dien-3-one (10). in addition, compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 possessed potent strong free radical scavenging activity. compounds 1 and 10 with powerful activity showed the higher content, implying important roles of 1 and 10 for the antioxidant activity of musa basjoo flower. the study suggested that components of musa basjoo flower possessed good antioxidant capacities and the species could be used in the prevention of diseases related to oxidant by-products of human metabolism.
computer-aided_design	the g protein coupled receptor 119 is an exciting and promising target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. in this study, three dimensional quantitative structure activity relationships i.e. a comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular field analysis region focusing have been carried out on a novel series of g protein coupled receptor 119 agonists. a quality pharmacophore model was built by hip-hop algorithm. the best pharmacophore model indicated which feature of hydrogen-bond acceptor and hydrophobic existed around active compounds. as the quality of the pharmacophore model is satisfactory, it was utilized to search the zinc database for a virtual screening task. the obtained compounds subjected to lipinski filter at first, were docked with gold algorithm to discover potent hits. the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (""gap"") implies high reactivity of the most active molecule in the active site of protein. in addition, the molecular electrostatic potential energy at density functional theory level confirms the results from molecular docking. in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicity risk assessment analysis were carried out on the seven hits with the highest gold score fitness. six of the new hits from virtual screening had diverse structures and are reported as new scaffold candidates for g protein coupled receptor 119 agonists.
materials_engineering	the increasing demand in the diverse device applications of transparent conducting oxides (tcos) requires synthesis of new tcos of n- or p-type conductivity. this article is about materials engineering of zno-sno2-in2o3-ga2o3 to synthesize powders of the quaternary compound zn2-xsn1-xinxgaxo4-delta in the stoichiometry of x = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 by solid state reaction at 1275 degrees c. lattice parameters were determined by x-ray diffraction (xrd) technique and solubility of in3+ and ga3+ in spinel zn2sno4 was found at 1275 degrees c. the solubility limit of in3+ and ga(3+)in zn2sno4 is found at below x = 0.4. the optical transmittance approximated by the uv-vis reflectance spectra showed excellent characteristics while optical band gap was consistent across 3.2 ev with slight decrease along increasing x value. carrier mobility of the species was considerably higher than the older versions of zinc stannate spinel co-substitutions whereas the carrier concentrations were moderate.
strength_of_materials	the estimation of the theoretical strength of materials is important in order to assess the potential for improvements in processing and design of structures, especially with the increased interests in nanostructured materials. most estimates are based on knowledge of inexact potential energy functions. fractal geometry presents a mathematical approach to the understanding of fracture in materials at all length scales. the fractal dimension, which is a quantitative characterization of the tortuosity of the fracture surface, is directly related to the toughness of a material. fractal geometry provides a framework by which bond rupture can be described as a series of bond reconfigurations. this article shows how fractal geometry can use this framework to estimate the theoretical strength of materials based on crack tip geometry and generated fracture surface without any assumption of the shape or type of potential energy function. the estimates are between the commonly quoted values of e/pi and e/8.

computer-aided_design	nowadays, power is a dominant factor that constrains highly integrated hardware-systems designs. the implied problems of high power density, causing chip overheating, or limited power source in modern internet-of-things devices are most commonly dealt with the use of the dynamic power management. this method enables to use power-reduction techniques, such as clock gating, power gating, or voltage and frequency scaling. since the adoption of power management is quite difficult in modern complex systems, there are new approaches evolving intended to simplify power-constrained systems design. we have also proposed such an approach, utilizing the system level of design abstraction and increased automation in the design process. in this paper, the proposed hybrid verification approach is described that represents an integral part of the suggested design methodology. it consists of formal and informal techniques, enabling the verification process to begin at the very early specification stage of the system development. our approach helps a designer to create correct and consistent power-management specification and verifies whether the specified power intent is preserved after design refinement. the continuous automated verification steps can quickly find errors at early design stages and thus reduce the amount of design re-spins, which speeds-up the overall development process.
immunology	background: the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology (eaaci) is in the process of developing the eaaci guidelines on allergen immunotherapy (ait) for the management of insect venom allergy. to inform this process, we sought to assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of ait in the management of insect venom allergy. methods: we undertook a systematic review, which involved searching 15 international biomedical databases for published and unpublished evidence. studies were independently screened and critically appraised using established instruments. data were descriptively summarized and, where possible, meta-analysed. results: our searches identified a total of 16 950 potentially eligible studies; of which, 17 satisfied our inclusion criteria. the available evidence was limited both in volume and in quality, but suggested that venom immunotherapy (vit) could substantially reduce the risk of subsequent severe systemic sting reactions (or = 0.08, 95% ci 0.03-0.26); meta-analysis showed that it also improved disease-specific quality of life (risk difference = 1.41, 95% ci 1.04-1.79). adverse effects were experienced in both the build-up and maintenance phases, but most were mild with no fatalities being reported. the very limited evidence found on modelling cost-effectiveness suggested that vit was likely to be cost-effective in those at high risk of repeated systemic sting reactions and/or impaired quality of life. conclusions: the limited available evidence suggested that vit is effective in reducing severe subsequent systemic sting reactions and in improving disease-specific quality of life. vit proved to be safe and no fatalities were recorded in the studies included in this review. the cost-effectiveness of vit needs to be established.
cell_biology	caveolin-2 (cav2) is a major protein component of caveolae in membranes of vascular smooth muscle and endothelium, yet its absence alters the ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibers. to gain insight into cav2 function in skeletal muscle, we tested the hypothesis that genetic deletion of cav2 would alter microvascular reactivity and depress contractile function of skeletal muscle in vivo. in the left gluteus maximus muscle (gm) of anesthetized cav2(-/-) and wild-type (wt) male mice (age, 6 mo), microvascular responses to physiological agonists and to gm contractions were studied at 34 degrees c. for feed arteries (fa), first- (1a), second( 2a) and third-order (3a) arterioles, respective mean diameters at rest (45, 35, 25, 12 mu m) and during maximal dilation (65, 55, 45, 30 mu m) were similar between groups. cumulative dilations to ach (10(-9) to 10(-5) m) and constrictions to norepinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) m) were also similar between groups, as were steady-state dilations during rhythmic twitch contractions (2 and 4 hz; 30 s). for single tetanic contractions (100 hz; 100, 250, and 500 ms), rapid onset vasodilation (rov) increased with contraction duration throughout networks in gm of both groups but was reduced by nearly half in cav2(-/-) mice compared with wt mice (p < 0.05). nevertheless, maximal force during tetanic contraction was similar to 40% greater in gm of cav2(-/-) vs. wt mice (152 +/- 14 vs. 110 +/- 3 mn per square millimeter, respectively; p < 0.05). thus, while structural and functional properties of resistance networks are well maintained in the gm of cav2(-/-) mice, diminished rov with greater force production reveals novel physiological roles for cav2 in skeletal muscle.
manufacturing_engineering	in this paper, training mode of professional master of aeronautics and astronautics manufacturing engineering in our relatively advanced domestic colleges (hit) was researched. the position and objective, curriculum system, practical ability and education methods of aeronautics and astronautics manufacturing engineering degree oriented to aerospace was further clarified. better basis for the master degree training of aeronautics and astronautics manufacturing engineering was provided for our county 's aerospace industry.
molecular_biology	aim: aim of the present study is to evaluate the risk of residual neoplastic foci, in patients treated with breast conservative surgery, based on duct carcinoma in situ (dcis) grading. materials and methods: the study is based on a retrospective analysis of 419 resection specimens relative to 161 patients. all these patients underwent surgical re-excision when the first specimen had shown one or more margins involved by dcis. margins were oriented and the side of margin involved was recorded. clonal analysis, using the mitochondrial dna (mtdna) technique, was obtained in selected cases. results: residual neoplastic foci were found in 145 out of 419 (34.6%) re-excised specimens. specifically, residual foci of dcis grade 2 and 3 were found more frequently in the margin facing the nipple (33.3% and 51.6%, respectively). on the contrary foci of dcis grade 1 did not show any specific distribution. clonal mt dna analysis evidenced that dcis grade 3 foci present in the re-excision specimens were genetically similar to the tumor removed in the first specimen, while dcis grade 1 foci were not clonally related each other. conclusions: the present data further confirm that dcis grade 3 is characterized by a circumscribed neoplastic process extending along the large ducts probably of a single mammary lobe. on the contrary dcis grade 1 is characterized by multiple independent neoplastic foci,, dispersed through several lobes indicating a field where multiple independent foci of cancer harbor.

manufacturing_engineering	aluminium matrix composites find wide applications in the present industrial scenario due to their desirable properties. study of the effect of process parameters on machinability of aluminium matrix composites is of paramount importance in the field of manufacturing engineering. machining of a composite depends on the properties and relative content of the reinforcement and the matrix materials as well as on its response to the machining process. in this article, investigations on the machinability aspects of aluminium-silicon carbide and aluminium-graphite composites are presented. experiments have been carried out through the design of experiments technique and regression machinability models have been developed, which express the degree to which the resultant force depends upon the cutting parameters and the percentage of reinforcement present in the aluminium matrix composites machined. a comparative study of the effect of cutting parameters on the resultant force has been presented.
fluid_mechanics	in this work, the wrf meteorological model is run in three different modes to estimate the wind energy potential in the bay of biscay for the 1990-2001 period. the first simulation (noda) involves a typical use of the wrf model and it does not use data assimilation. the second one (12hda) performs 3dvar data assimilation at 00 utc and 12 utc. finally, 6hda uses 3dvar data assimilation at 00 utc, 06 utc, 12 utc and 18 utc. verification for the three simulations has been carried out at a preliminary stage using wind data from buoys, and then a spatially distributed analysis has been conducted of surface wind based on satellite data from the cross-calibrated multi-platform (ccmp). to that purpose, the spatial correlation and error patterns over our study area have been used as statistical indicators. the results indicate that the wind values obtained with data assimilation every six hours (6hda) yield the best verification scores at a 95% confidence level, thereby being the most accurate at reproducing wind observations in the area. regarding the estimation of wind energy potential, at a second stage, we tested the calculation 's sensitivity to the use of data assimilation. the most reliable simulation with data assimilation (6hda) estimates 21% less energy potential than the simulation without data assimilation. in the absence of historical wind observation records of the sea with sufficient time and space resolution, meteorological models such as wrf provide an estimation of the wind values in tentative areas for offshore wind farms. in this line, our study highlights the need to use meteorological models with data assimilation, as future wind energy production can then be more realistically estimated beforehand. this may also contribute to a more accurate economic and technical evaluation of the risks and benefits for future investments in offshore wind energy.

hydraulics	large-scale reactor calculations with monte carlo (mc), including nonlinear feedback effects, have become a reality in the course of the last decade. in particular, implementations of coupled mc and thermalhydraulic (t-h) calculations have been separately developed by many different groups. numerous mc codes have been coupled to a variety of t-h codes (system level, subchannel, and computational fluid dynamics). in this work we review the numerical methods that have been used to solve the coupled mc-t-h problem with a particular focus on the formulation of the nonlinear problem, convergence criteria, and relaxation schemes used to ensure stability of the iterative process. we use a simple pressurized water reactor pin cell problem to numerically investigate the stability of commonly used schemes and which problem parameters influence the stability-or lack thereof. we also examine the role that the running strategy used in the mc calculation plays in the convergence of the coupled calculation. results indicate that the instability in fixed-point iterations is driven by the doppler feedback effect and that underrelaxation can be used to restore stability. we also observed that a form of underrelaxation could be achieved by performing the coupled iterations without converging the mc fission source each iteration. by performing many iterations of few histories, we observed rapid convergence to the coupled mc-t-h solution in a relatively small number of batches. numerical results also showed that the presence of instability in the fixed-point iteration is independent of the stochastic noise in the mc simulation.
enzymology	spore photoproduct lyase (spl) repairs a special thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, which is commonly called spore photoproduct or sp at the bacterial early germination phase. sp is the exclusive dna photo-damage product in bacterial endospores; its generation and swift repair by spl are responsible for the spores' extremely high uv resistance. the early in vivo studies suggested that spl utilizes a direct reversal strategy to repair the sp in the absence of light. the research in the past decade further established spl as a radical sam enzyme, which utilizes a tri-cysteine cxxxcxxc motif to harbor a [4fe-4s] cluster. at the 1 + oxidation state, the cluster provides an electron to the s-adenosylmethionine (sam), which binds to the cluster in a bidentate manner as the fourth and fifth ligands, to reductively cleave the c-s bond associated with the sulfonium ion in sam. generating a reactive 5'-deoxyadenosyl (5'-da) radical. this 5'-da radical abstracts the pror hydrogen atom from the c6 carbon of sp to initiate the repair process; the resulting sp radical subsequently fragments to generate a putative thymine methyl radical, which accepts a back-donated h atom to yield the repaired tpt. sam is suggested to be regenerated at the end of each catalytic cycle; and only a catalytic amount of sam is needed in the spl reaction. the h atom source for the back donation step is suggested to be a cysteine residue (c141 in bacillus subtilis spl), and the h-atom transfer reaction leaves a thiyl radical behind on the protein. this thiyl radical thus must participate in the sam regeneration process; however how the thiyl radical abstracts an h atom from the 5'-da to regenerate sam is unknown. this paper reviews and discusses the history and the latest progress in the mechanistic elucidation of spl. despite some recent breakthroughs, more questions are raised in the mechanistic understanding of this intriguing dna repair enzyme. this article is part of a special issue entitled: radical sam enzymes and radical enzymology.

computer-aided_design	the rational design of molecularly imprinted polymers (mips) has been a major contributor to their reputation as ""plastic antibodies"" - high affinity robust synthetic receptors which can be optimally designed, and produced for a much reduced cost than their biological equivalents. computational design has become a routine procedure in the production of mips, and has led to major advances in functional monomer screening, selection of cross-linker and solvent, optimisation of monomer(s)-template ratio and selectivity analysis. in this review the various computational methods will be discussed with reference to all the published relevant literature since the end of 2013, with each article described by the target molecule, the computational approach applied (whether molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics, semi-empirical quantum mechanics, ab initio quantum mechanics (hartree-fock, moller-plesset, etc.) or dft) and the purpose for which they were used. detailed analysis is given to novel techniques including analysis of polymer binding sites, the use of novel screening programs and simulations of mip polymerisation reaction. the further advances in molecular modelling and computational design of synthetic receptors in particular will have serious impact on the future of nanotechnology and biotechnology, permitting the further translation of mips into the realms of analytics and medical technology.

human_metabolism	hydrogen sulfide is presented in textbooks as toxic, environmentally unacceptable species, however some positive effects in human metabolism were discovered in the last decades. it is important to offer students also some new information about this compound. as didactic tool in this case may serve serial precipitation of cd2+, cu2+, zn2+, mn2+ and pb2+ ions forming various colored sulfides in bubblers with chemically generated hydrogen sulfide stream. this experiment has strong and diverse color effect for enhancing the visual perception to motivate students to understand more abstract and complex information about hydrogen sulfide. it also may be helpful in analytical chemistry courses for conditional precipitation equilibrium teaching and calculations.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: by the end of the 2013-2016 west african ebola virus disease (evd) outbreaks, a total of 3814 cases (probable and confirmed) and 2544 deaths were reported in guinea. clearly, surveillance activities aiming at stopping human-to-human transmission have been the breakthrough of evd outbreak management, but their application has been at times easier said than done. this article presents five confirmed or probable evd cases that arose in conakry towards the end of the guinea epidemic, which demonstrate flaws in surveillance and follow-up. case presentation: for case 1, safe burial requirements were not followed. for cases 1 and 2, negative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) results were interpreted as no infection. for the first case, the sample may have not been taken properly while for the second the disease was possibly at its early stage. case 3 was stopped at a border health checkpoint and despite her high temperature she was allowed to continue the bus journey. for case 4, an oral swab sample was supposedly taken after death but could not be found for retrospective testing. despite characteristic symptomatology, case 5 was not identified as a suspect case for as long as 3 weeks. conclusion: in epidemic contexts, health systems must be able to track all samples of suspect cases and deaths, regardless of their laboratory results. social mobilization in communities and training in health care facilities must be strengthened at the tail of an outbreak, to avoid the natural slackening of disease surveillance, in particular for long-lasting and deadly epidemics.
northern_blotting	the long-day plant petunia x hybrida 'fantasy red' was found to produce a considerable number of premature abortive flower buds when placed under short light period stress. suppression subtractive hybridization (ssh) was performed to compare the gene expression profiles between normal and abortive petunia flower buds as induced by short light periods. using reverse northern blotting, a total of 912 positive clones were successfully identified and sequenced, and 289 non-redundant, differentially expressed transcripts were obtained. according to the blast2go and kegg pathway analyses, the significant distinct cellular component was identified as mitochondrion, and the notable different metabolic pathways were ascribed to carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism. the quality of the ssh libraries was verified through quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis of 14 genes. in addition, six of these genes were demonstrated to be of temporal and/or spatial specificity using qrt-pcr, implying that they might be responsible for the premature flower abortion. furthermore, phms2 (kc465381), a sequence sharing a high degree of similarity with male sterility 2 gene was characterized, and its inconsistent expression pattern predicted a novel role for phms2 in flower bud abortion. the data presented here provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of premature flower abortion under short light periods and, hence, may be of value for assessing candidate genes with potential for creating novel germplasms with enhanced photoperiod stress tolerance. crown copyright (c) 2013 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
computer-aided_design	in the paper a possibility of using a metrology micro computed tomography (ct) to assess quality of parts made by rapid prototyping technique was presented. additive manufacturing techniques dramatically change the approach to manufacturing process. not long ago they allowed solely for obtaining a spatial model of a part in order to visualize its features. nowadays, it is possible to produce elements and assembly groups with properties that make it possible to replace many parts manufactured using traditional casting or injection techniques. polymer components created by means of 3d printing can be generated one layer of material after another. in many cases inner spaces (sections) are not fully filled in (solid), they are rather replaced by a specially selected structure. thanks to this it is possible to save material and reduce weight. to control these structures and to inspect joints between particular layers using a non-destructive method it is necessary to use a metrology micro ct. in the paper an application of x-ray computed tomography and assessment of measurement uncertainty regarding elements manufactured with fused deposition modeling (fdm) method using abs 3d printing on up! printer was presented. inspection of both: inner structure and outer shapes as well as joints between them was performed basing on computer aided design (cad) model.
strength_of_materials	purpose - the paper 's aim is to synthesise ultraviolet (uv) curable polyurethane acrylate based on polyester polyol and to study change in its mechanical, chemical, optical and weather resistance properties with varying amount of nanosilica. it also seeks to determine its optimum loading levels for property maximisation. design/methodology/approach - new uv curable polyurethane acrylate has been synthesised using polyester polyol, blend of isophorone diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate and hydroxyl ethyl acrylate this resin was incorporated with nanosilica (1-3 per cent) on the basis of total solids the newly synthesised material was characterised by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy the mechanical, chemical and optical properties of the coating films were studied and compared findings - the hardness, tensile strength and abrasion resistance show significant enhancement with increasing amount of nanosilica. it is also found that uv cured polyurethane acrylate nanocoating exhibited improved weather resistance the optimum concentration of nanosilica for better performance is found to be 3 per cent of total solids. the improvement is the result of inherent nature of nanosilica research limitations/implications - nanosilica used in present context is having 10 nm mean diameter and near about 600 m(2)/g surface area. nanosilica having different particle size, surface area and surface modification can be used to improve more specific properties practical implications - addition of nanosilica particles to polyurethane acrylate coating is a simple and inexpensive method resulting in phenomenal increase in properties. originality/value - the new organic-inorganic hybrid nanocoating with improved weather resistance was synthesised these coatings could find applications in demanding fields such as automotive topcoats
northern_blotting	object. because of toxicity at high concentrations, nitric oxide (no) contributes to spinal cord injury (sci) secondary lesions. at low concentrations no modulates nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b) activation. the authors investigated the activity of neuronal and endothelial no synthase (nnos and enos) to determine correlations with nf-kappa b activation and inducible nos (inos) expression soon after sci. methods. in 48 adult male wistar rats clip-based (50 g/mm(2)/10 seconds) sci was induced, and spinal cords were removed at different intervals for the following evaluations: 1) assaying specific activity of nnos and enos; 2) electrophoresis mobility shift assay for activated nf-kappa b, 3) northern blotting for inos; 4) immunohistochemistry for inos and nf-kappa b; and 5) immunofluorescence for inos and nf-kappa b. at 15 minutes postinjury, enos activity decreased significantly (p < 0.001). as did nnos activity at 1 hour compared with these levels in control animals and rats killed at 15 and 30 minutes after sci (p < 0.001). basal nf-kappa b levels were variable in controls and at 15 and 30 minutes after injury. one hour postinjury, nf-kappa b activation was diffuse. inducible nos messenger rna localized diffusely, peaking 6 hours after injury and remaining stable until 24 hours postinjury. immunohistochemical analysis showed diffuse inos and nf-kappa b staining, especially in neurons inside and around the lesion. immunofluorescence demonstrated that injured neurons were a source of nf-kappa b and inos soon after injury. conclusions. both nnos and enos exhibited different regulation and roles soon after injury: nnos correlated with nf-kappa b activation, whereas enos may have participated in vascular changes of the injured spinal cord. neurons seemed to play a pivotal role in modulating and amplifying the inflammatory response in the injured spinal cord.
fluid_mechanics	a new compact scheme has been developed for any non-uniform grid. the compact scheme has been developed for spatial discretization and is analyzed here in conjunction with four-stage, fourth order runge-kutta (rk4) scheme for time integration while solving the one-dimensional convection equation. the space-time discretization combination is calibrated by subjecting the system to global spectral analysis (gsa) which was developed by the authors' group. here, the compact scheme has been obtained by using a combination of two bi-diagonal schemes. the novel aspect of this scheme is its application in the physical plane directly without the necessity of mapping or transformations. some typical cases for problems in acoustics, as well as fluid mechanics, have been studied here and potential use in large eddy simulations (les) has been demonstrated by solving navier-stokes equation for lid driven cavity.

human_metabolism	the factors dramatically influencing thermal comfort usually involve air temperature, radiant temperature, air humidity, air velocity, clothes insulation, and metabolic rate. however, under some special conditions, e. g., altitude environment, the air pressure should be taken into account. exposure to altitude tends to produce deterioration in human heat diffusion performance, rate of convective heat transfer decreases, and rate of convective heat transfer increases with altitude, energy balance between human body and environment is different from in the normal conditions. in the experiments, thermal perception of 20 test persons (240 person-times) was observed by subjective questionnaire in a simulated hypobaric chamber where the air parameters were controllable. the temperature was set at 22 degrees c, and the barometric conditions were set at 1, 0.95, 0.9, 0.8 atm of simulated hypobaric conditions, corresponding altitude of 0, 400, 800, 2,000 m, respectively. experiments solved the metabolic rate raised with pressure drop, and the measured pmv differed from actual thermal sensation votes in hypobaric conditions. moreover, the falling barometric pressure leads to decline in alveolar oxygen, a variety of adaptive physiological processes for oxygen delivery, human metabolism, and thermoregulatory responses as well as thermal perception change. however, the present thermal sensation models were built in the normal environment and there were many divergences in conclusions. combined with the experiments, this article builds the thermal sensation estimating model under the hypobaric conditions by principal component analysis. the purpose of this study was to make clear whether hypobaric exposure will affect people 's thermal sensation and maybe helpful to establish the indoor thermal comfort criterion in the hypobaric environment.
enzymology	physical activity is frequently used as a strategy to decrease pathogenesis and improve outcomes in chronic pathologies such as metabolic or cardiac diseases. in mice, it has been shown that voluntary wheel running (vwr) could induce an aerobic training effect and may provide a means of exploring the relationship between physical activity and the progression of pathology, or the effect of a drug on locomotor activity. to the best of our knowledge, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and other non-invasive methods had not been investigated for training evaluation in mice; therefore, it was proposed to test an mri method coupled with a cardiorespiratory gating system on c57bi/6 mice for in vivo heart anatomical and functional characterization in both trained and untrained animals. twenty mice were either assigned to a 12-week vwr program or to a control group (con - no wheel in the cage). at week 12, mri scans showed an increase in the left ventricular (lv) wall mass in the vwr group compared with the con group. the ex vivo measurements also found an increase in the heart and lv weight, as well as an increase in oxidative enzyme activities (i.e. cytochrome c oxidase [cox] in the soleus). in addition, correlations have been observed between ex vivo lv/body weight ratio, cox activity in the soleus and in vivo mri lv wall mass/body weight. in conclusion, mouse cardiac mri methods coupled with a cardiorespiratory gating system are sufficiently effective and feasible for non-invasive, training-induced heart hypertrophy characterization, and may be used for longitudinal training level follow-up in mouse models of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
fluid_mechanics	the violations of the second law are relevant as the length and/or time scales become very small. the second law then needs to be replaced by the fluctuation theorem and mathematically, the irreversible entropy is a submartingale. first, we discuss the consequences of these results for the axioms of continuum mechanics, arguing in favor of a framework relying on stochastic functionals of energy and entropy. we next determine a lyapunov function for diffusion-type problems governed by stochastic rather than deterministic functionals of internal energy and entropy, where the random field coefficients of diffusion are not required to satisfy the positive definiteness everywhere. next, a formulation of micropolar fluid mechanics is developed, accounting for the lack of symmetry of stress tensor on molecular scales. this framework is then applied to employed to show that spontaneous random fluctuations of the microrotation field will arise in couette-and poiseuille-type flows in the absence of random (turbulence-like) fluctuations of the classical velocity field. finally, while the permeability is classically modeled by the darcy law or its modifications, besides considering the violations of the second law, one also needs to account for the spatial randomness of the channel network, implying a modification of the hierarchy of scale-dependent bounds on the macroscopic property of the network.
thermodynamics	herein, we studied the absorption of h2s and co2 by alkanolamine protic ionic liquids binary mixtures based on 2-hydroxyethylammonium (mea) or triethanolammonium cations and residues of 2hydroxy-5-sulfobenzoic acid or pyridine-3-carboxylic acid at various temperatures and partial gases pressures. it was found that absorbents based on the 2-hydroxyethylammonium cation, performed high absorption properties toward the h2s. the solubility of hydrogen sulfide, characterized by the henry 's law constant, in mea-based binary mixtures had the values comparable to the commercially available ionic liquids. the results of thermal desorption analysis demonstrated that the capture of acid gases in meabased absorbents occurred at two stages: through the dissolution in mea component and in protic ionic liquid.
genetics	population-genomic analyses are essential to understanding factors shaping genomic variation and lineage-specific sequence constraints. the dearth of such analyses for unicellular eukaryotes prompted us to assess genomic variation in paramecium, one of the most well-studied ciliate genera. the paramecium aurelia complex consists of similar to 15 morphologically indistinguishable species that diverged subsequent to two rounds of whole-genome duplications (wgds, as long as 320 mya) and possess extremely streamlined genomes. we examine patterns of both nuclear and mitochondrial polymorphism, by sequencing whole genomes of 10-13 worldwide isolates of each of three species belonging to the p. aurelia complex: p. tetraurelia, p. biaurelia, p. sexaurelia, as well as two outgroup species that do not share the wgds: p. caudatum and p. multimicronucleatum. an apparent absence of global geographic population structure suggests continuous or recent dispersal of paramecium over long distances. intergenic regions are highly constrained relative to coding sequences, especially in p. caudatum and p. multimicronucleatum that have shorter intergenic distances. sequence diversity and divergence are reduced up to similar to 100-150 bp both upstream and downstream of genes, suggesting strong constraints imposed by the presence of densely packed regulatory modules. in addition, comparison of sequence variation at non-synonymous and synonymous sites suggests similar recent selective pressures on paralogs within and orthologs across the deeply diverging species. this study presents the first genome-wide population-genomic analysis in ciliates and provides a valuable resource for future studies in evolutionary and functional genetics in paramecium.
machine_design	it was recently demonstrated that the synchronous reluctance motor is well suited for electric as well as for hybrid electric vehicles. this paper deeply investigates the capabilities of a synchronous reluctance motor and compares them with those of a permanent-magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motor, according to the typical requirement of a traction application. a proper rotor design is necessary. the average torque is due to the rotor anisotropy. the permeance difference between the directand the quadrature-axis is achieved by means of a high number of flux barriers. the position of the flux barrier ends and proper rotor asymmetries are chosen so as to reduce the torque ripple, mainly due to the slot harmonics. the impact of the rotor design on the motor performance is presented deeply, showing several simulation and experimental results, carried out on synchronous reluctance motors with different rotor geometries. permanent magnets can be inset in the flux barriers to assist the synchronous reluctance motor improving its capabilities, but avoiding to use rare-earth permanent magnets. the main advantages of the permanent magnet assistance is an increase of the main torque density and of the power factor. they are evaluated experimentally. however, the drawback of adopting permanent magnets is the possible demagnetization of the magnets themselves. this can greatly limit the maximum overload capability of the motor, which is a salient requirement of a traction motor.
cell_biology	systems cell biology understanding of development requires characterization of all the molecules produced in the biological system. decades of research and new-generation sequencing provided functional information on key genes and transcripts. however, there is less information available on how differential gene expression translates into the domains of functionally important proteins, peptides, and metabolites, and how changes in these molecules impact development. mass spectrometry (ms) is the current technology of choice for the detection and quantification of large numbers of proteins and metabolites, because it requires no use of antibodies, functional probes, or a priori knowledge of molecules produced in the system. this review focuses on recent technologies that have improved ms sensitivity for proteins and metabolites and enabled new functionalities to assess their temporal and spatial changes during vertebrate embryonic development. this review highlights case studies, in which new-generation ms tools have enabled the study of hundreds-to-thousands of proteins and metabolites in tissues, cell populations, and single cells in model systems of vertebrate development, particularly the frog (xenopus), zebrafish, and mouse. new-generation ms expands the toolbox of cell and developmental studies, raising exciting potentials to advance basic and translational research in the life sciences.
enzymology	the 16th international meeting on the enzymology and molecular biology of carbonyl metabolism, castle of ploen (schleswig-holstein, germany), july 10-15, 2012, covered all aspects of nad(p)-dependent oxido-reductases that are involved in the general metabolism of xenobiotic and physiological carbonyl compounds. starting 30 years ago with enzyme purification, structure elucidation and enzyme kinetics, the carbonyl society members have meanwhile established internationally recognized enzyme nomenclature systems and now consider aspects of enzyme genomics and enzyme evolution along with their roles in diseases. the 16th international meeting included lectures from international speakers from all over the world.
molecular_biology	the mouse isolated perfused kidney (mipk) is a technique for keeping a mouse kidney under ex vivo conditions perfused and functional for 1 hr. this is a prerequisite for studying the physiology of the isolated organ and for many innovative applications that may be possible in the future, including perfusion decellularization for kidney bioengineering or the administration of anti-rejection or genome-editing drugs in high doses to prime the kidney for transplantation. during the time of the perfusion, the kidney can be manipulated, renal function can be assessed, and various pharmaceuticals administered. after the procedure, the kidney can be transplanted or processed for molecular biology, biochemical analysis, or microscopy. this paper describes the perfusate and the surgical technique needed for the ex vivo perfusion of mouse kidneys. details of the perfusion apparatus are given and data are presented showing the viability of the kidney 's preparation: renal blood flow, vascular resistance, and urine data as functional, transmission electron micrographs of different nephron segments as morphological readouts, and western blots of transport proteins of different nephron segments as molecular readout.
genetics	the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)/crispr-associated protein 9 (cas9) system provides a technological breakthrough in mutant generation. several methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (pcr)/restriction enzyme (re) assay, t7 endonuclease i (t7ei) assay, surveyor nuclease assay, page-based genotyping assay, and high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis-based assay have been developed for screening crispr/cas9-induced mutants. however, these methods are time and labour-intensive and may also be sequence-limited or require very expensive equipment. here, we described a cost-effective and sensitive screening technique based on conventional pcr, annealing at critical temperature pcr (act-pcr), for identifying mutants. act-pcr requires only a single pcr step followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. we demonstrated that act-pcr accurately distinguished crispr/cas9-induced mutants from wild type in both rice and zebrafish. moreover, the method can be adapted for accurately determining mutation frequency in cultured cells. the simplicity of act-pcr makes it particularly suitable for rapid, large-scale screening of crispr/cas9-induced mutants in both plants and animals. copyright (c) 2017, institute of genetics and developmental biology, chinese academy of sciences, and genetics society of china. published by elsevier limited and science press. all rights reserved.
northern_blotting	objective-endothelial activation is implicated in atherogenesis and diabetes. the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (ppar-delta) in endothelial activation remains poorly understood. in this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of ppar-delta and the mechanism involved. methods and results-in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs), the synthetic ppar-delta ligands gw0742 and gw501516 significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and e-selectin (assayed by real-time rt-pcr and northern blotting), as well as the ensuing endothelial-leukocyte adhesion. activation of ppar-delta upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase 1, catalase, and thioredoxin and decreased reactive oxygen species production in ecs. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that gw0742 switched the association of bcl-6, a transcription repressor, from ppar-delta to the vascular cell adhesion molecule ( vcam)-1 promoter. small interfering rna reduced endogenous ppar-delta expression but potentiated the suppressive effect of gw0742 on ec activation, which suggests that the nonliganded ppar-delta may have an opposite effect. conclusions-we have demonstrated that ligand activation of ppar-delta in ecs has a potent antiinflammatory effect, probably via a binary mechanism involving the induction of antioxidative genes and the release of nuclear corepressors. ppar-delta agonists may have a potential for treating inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes.
northern_blotting	pneumocystis carinii (pc) adhesion to alveolar epithelial cells is well established and is thought to be a prerequisite for the initiation of pneumocystis pneumonia. pc binding events occur in part through the major pc surface glycoprotein msg, as well as an integrin-like molecule termed pcint1. recent data from the pc sequencing project also demonstrate dna sequences homologous to other genes important in candida spp. binding to mammalian host cells, as well as organism binding to polystyrene surfaces and in biofilm formation. one of these genes, flo8, a transcription factor needed for downstream camp/pka-pathway-mediated activation of the major adhesion/flocculin flo11 in yeast, was cloned from a pc cdna library utilizing a partial sequence available in the pc genome database. a chef blot of pc genomic dna yielded a single band providing evidence this gene is present in the organism. blastp analysis of the predicted protein demonstrated 41 % homology to the saccharomyces cerevisiae flo8. northern blotting demonstrated greatest expression at ph 6.0-8.0, ph comparable to reported fungal biofilm milieu. western blot and immunoprecipitation assays of pcflo8 protein in isolated cyst and tropic life forms confirmed the presence of the cognate protein in these pc life forms. heterologous expression of pcflo8 cdna in flo8 delta-deficient yeast strains demonstrated that the pcflo8 was able to restore yeast binding to polystyrene and invasive growth of yeast flo8 delta cells. furthermore, pcflo8 promoted yeast binding to hek293 human epithelial cells, strengthening its functional classification as a flo8 transcription factor. taken together, these data suggest that pcflo8 is expressed by pc and may exert activity in organism adhesion and biofilm formation.
strength_of_materials	data are presented describing refined simulations of perturbation growth in a three-layer cylindrical liner system tested with disk explosive magnetic flux compression generators (demgs) to study the strength properties of copper and polyethylene at shocklessly applied pressures of up to similar to 15 gpa. the calculated performance for the same liner system in the experiments to study the strength properties of copper at shockless loading of up to similar to 40-gpa pressures is presented. the feasibility of similar strength experiments with quasi-isentropic material compression to similar to 2000 gpa using demgs is demonstrated.
manufacturing_engineering	the purposes of this study are to develop a simulator generating a ski board vibration in actual skiing and to perform the basic construction for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism, which still has not been clarified completely. in the simulator developed in this study, the surface on the bottom of the ski was assumed as to be a snowy slope and a mass of snow (snow pack) assuming a skier had slid on this ski bottom surface. a ball vibrator connected to a large-sized compressor was installed onto the ski panel in order to vibrate a ski board. the compressed air from the compressor rotated a steel ball in the vibrator at high speed, causing vibration on the ski. a dynamic friction force (f) was detected by the digital force gauge when the snow pack was sliding from the top of the ski to the tail on the surface formed by the bottom of the ski. a coefficient of kinetic friction (mu k) was calculated using this dynamic friction force. furthermore, the velocity and acceleration of the snow pack were measured by two high speeded cameras. the experiment for confirming the validity of this simulator was carried out in the temperature conditions of -5 degrees c. the velocity and acceleration of the snow pack with vibration were higher than without vibration. on the other hand, the coefficient of kinetic friction (mu k) with vibration was lower than without vibration. from these results, the simulator is suitable for studying the role of vibration in ski sliding and for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism.

strength_of_materials	the paper has a discussion of forward problem and inverse problem for beams in strength of materials. known load case of a beam can certainly determine its shearing force diagram and bending moment diagram, but conversely, there may be a variety of statically determinate or statically indeterminate constraint conditions. furthermore, the solution from statically indeterminate constraint conditions does n't agree with the given shearing force diagram and bending moment diagram in a general way.
southern_blotting	accumulated data have shown that most human somatic cells or tissues show irreversible telomere shortening with age, and that there are strong associations between telomere attrition and aging-related diseases, including cancers, diabetes and cognitive disorders. although it has been largely accepted that telomere attrition is one of the major causes of aging-related disorders, critical aspects of telomere biology remain unresolved, especially the lack of standardized methodology for quantification of telomere length. another frustrating issue is that no potentially promising methods for safe prevention of telomere erosion, or for telomere elongation, have been devised. here, we review several methods for quantification of telomere length currently utilized worldwide, considering their advantages and drawbacks. we also summarize the results of our recent studies of human cells and tissues, mainly using quantitative fluorescence insitu hybridization and southern blotting, including those derived from patients with progeria-prone werner syndrome and trisomy 21, and several strains of induced pluripotent stem cells. we discuss the possible merits of using telomere shortness as an indicator, or a new marker, for diagnosis of precancerous states and aging-related disorders. in addition, we describe newly found factors that are thought to impact telomere dynamics, providing a new avenue for examining the unsolved issues related to telomere restoration and maintenance. geriatr gerontol int 2016; 16 (suppl. 1): 30-42.
genetics	understanding how genetics influences inter-individual variation of antibody titers in response to measles vaccination is vital to understanding possible sources of vaccine failure as well as improved vaccine development. although it is recognized that both the human leukocyte antigen (hla) genes and the immunoglobulin allotype genes play significant roles in immune response, there is significant variation in antibody titers that is not explained by these genes. to obtain a more complete estimate of the role of the entire genome, we used a large panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms to estimate the heritability of antibody response to measles vaccine. based on 935 subjects with european ancestry, we estimated the heritability to be 49% (standard error 0.17). we also estimated the heritability attributable to each chromosome, and found a large range in chromosome-specific heritabilities. notably, chromosome 1 had the largest estimate (28%), while chromosome 6, which harbors hla, had an estimated heritability of 13%. compared with a prior study of twins in the same community, which resulted in a heritability estimate of 88.5%, our study suggests there are either many rare genetic variants, or many common genetic variants of small effect sizes that contribute to variations of antibody titers in response to measles vaccine.

cell_biology	cell culture is a well-established standard technique and a fundamental tool in biology and medicine. establishment of a novel culture method by meeting various challenges can sometimes open up new fields of cell biology and medicine. an artificial microenvironment for cultured cells is made up of complicated factors, including cytokines, scaffold material type, cell-cell interactions, and physical stress. to replicate the tissue architecture, cell-cell interactions, and specific physical microenvironment, we previously demonstrated the effectiveness of a three-dimensional culture system, and further established two simple culture systems: air-liquid interface (ali) and fluid flow stress (ffs). a three-dimensional collagen gel culture system can replicate cell-cell interactions in vitro. as skin is constantly exposed to air, the ali system closely mimicked the skin microenvironment and maintained the homeostasis of the epidermis and dermis. the ali culture system also revealed the possibility of skin regeneration through ectopic mesenchymal cell involvement. fluid streaming and shear stress were recently demonstrated to constitute the critical microenvironment for various cell types. the ffs system demonstrated that fluid streaming induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of mesothelial cells, leading to peritoneal fibrosis. our novel culture systems will hopefully open up new fields of regenerative medicine and pathological research.
hydraulics	paleokarst is most commonly expressed as subtle stratigraphic surfaces rather than large void systems penetrating deeply into the paleo-subsurface. in contrast, a regional precambrian-cambrian unconformity on victoria island (nwt, canada), is associated with exceptional exposure of large, intact cambrian paleocavems (100 m diameter; tens of m high). the paleocaves are distributed along a paleo-horizontal plane, and an associated gryke network is present in the 30-60 m of neoproterozoic dolostone between cave rooves and the base of overlying cambrian sandstone; both are filled by cambrian sandstone. the formation and preservation of such karst features require aggressive dissolution along a stable paleo-water-table shortly before transgression and deposition of shallow-marine sand over the dolostone. during the transgression, the karst network acted as a conduit for flowing groundwater that was discharged through overlying, unconsolidated cambrian shallow-marine sand, producing water-escape structures (sand volcanoes and their conduits). the conduits are preserved as cylindrical remnants of the sand volcanoes' feeder pipes. sediment fluidisation was probably caused by variations in the hydraulic-head gradient in a meteoric lens near the cambrian coastline under a tropical climate with abundant, probably seasonally variable rainfall that caused pulses in subsurface fluid flow. spatial distribution of the paleocaves and sand volcanoes suggests their formation on the southeast side of a recently faulted horst of proterozoic carbonate bedrock that formed a nearshore island during early cambrian sea-level rise. fluidisation structures such as those reported here have generally been difficult to interpret owing to a lack of data on the fluid hydraulics of the underlying aquifer. this is the first report linking the hydraulics of a well-characterised paleokarst to development of fluid-escape structures. such structures are widely known from sandstones overlying the sub-cambrian unconformity around the circumference of laurentia.

machine_design	iron loss modeling is crucial for electric machine design. however, current models feature severe drawbacks. they are 1) very complex, and thus, can hardly be applied, 2) require very high effort for measuring and computation, and/or 3) are not very accurate. in this paper, a newmodeling technique is introduced for calculating the instantaneous power loss in ferromagnetic materials without taking the magnetization history into account. a standard measurement setup and specimen shape is used. the considered approach comprises the required measurements, the nonlinear loss modeling by itself, and an extensive verification for different flux density waveforms and frequencies. in addition, a detailed qualitative comparison to well-known iron loss models is given. the presented technique gives very accurate results, while obtaining the model is comparably easy. moreover, as the calculation of the instantaneous losses is not based on the previous magnetization state of the material, a modeling error for a particular instant of time has no impact on the subsequently calculated characteristics. in the future, this model should ensure a more accurate iron loss calculation for electric machine designs.
genetics	male secondary sexual traits and female mate choice traits must contain heritable variation for sexual selection to operate. however, for female mate choice, especially, this is poorly known. to complicate matters, both male sexual traits and female mate choice typically show condition dependence, implying that environmental effects probably play an important synergistic role. using a cross-fostering design, we therefore aimed to disentangle genetic, environmental and their potential interacting effects to investigate how they affect the expression of a sexually selected trait (here birdsong) and female mate choice. to assess environmental effects, we focused on the role of the social environment and thus on learned components. among the different male song traits investigated, we found a high heritability for song bout length and song bout repertoire, as well as an intriguing gene-by-environment interaction for song bout repertoire. specifically, the tutor appeared to negatively affect the song bout repertoire of the tutee when his genetic father had a large song bout repertoire but had a positive effect on descendants from fathers with small song bout repertoires. in contrast, we did not detect significant heritability in female mate choice. female mate choice contained a learned component as females significantly disfavoured their foster father in the mate choice tests, indicating a learned inbreeding avoidance. thus, our study provides important insights into the role of the social environment for both birdsong and female mate choice. however, the absence of a heritable component in female mate choice suggests a need for studies investigating the heritability of female preferences for (heritable) male song traits in order to gain a better understanding of a potential coevolution between male sexual traits and female mate choice. overall, our results suggest that indirect genetic effects acting during the pre- and postfledging social contexts may play a prominent role in sexual selection.

cell_biology	extracellular adenosine is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that modulates a wide array of biological processes. recently, significant advances have been made in our understanding of a(2b) adenosine receptor (a(2b)ar). in this review, we first summarize some of the general characteristics of a(2b)ar, and then we describe the multiple binding partners of the receptor, such as newly identified alpha-actinin-1 and p105, and discuss how these associated proteins could modulate a(2b)ar 's functions, including certain seemingly paradoxical functions of the receptor. growing evidence indicates a critical role of a(2b)ar in cancer, renal disease, and diabetes, in addition to its importance in the regulation of vascular diseases, and lung disease. here, we also discuss the role of a(2b)ar in cancer, renal disease, and diabetes and the potential of the receptor as a target for treating these three diseases.
thermodynamics	evolution of vibration relaxation of hydrogen atoms in metals with the close-packed lattice at high and medium temperatures is investigated based on non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, in that number on using the retarded two-time green function method. in accordance with main kinetic equation - the generalized fokker-plank- kolmogorov equation, anharmonism of hydrogen atoms vibration in potential wells does not make any contribution to collision effects. it influences the relaxation processes at the expense of interference of fourth order anharmonism with single-phonon scattering on impurity hydrogen atoms. therefore, the total relaxation time of vibration energy of system metal-hydrogen is written as a product of two factors: relaxation time of system in harmonic approximation and dimensionless anharmonic attenuation of quantum hydrogen state.
fluid_mechanics	certain medical treatments involve the introduction of exogenous liquids in the lungs. these liquids can form plugs within the airways. the plugs propagate throughout the branching network in the lungs being forced by airflow. they leave a deposited film on the airway walls and split at bifurcations. understanding the resulting distribution of liquid throughout the lungs is important for the effective administration of the prescribed treatments. in this paper, we investigate numerically the splitting of a liquid plug by a two-dimensional pulmonary bifurcation under the influence of a transverse gravitational field. the splitting is characterized by the splitting ratio, which is the ratio of volume of the liquid plug in the daughter channels and depends on the capillary number and the orientation of the bifurcation plane with respect to a three-dimensional gravitational field. it is observed that gravity induces asymmetry in the splitting, causing the splitting ratio to he reduced. this effect is mitigated as the capillary number is increased. it is also observed that there exists a critical capillary number where the plug will not split and will instead propagate entirely into the gravitationally favoured daughter channel we also compute the wall stresses on the bifurcation walls and observe the locations where stresses and their gradients are the highest in magnitude.
enzymology	the emergence of next-generation sequencing has provided new opportunities in the discovery of new nonribosomal peptides (nrps) and nrp synthethases (nrpss). however, there remain challenges for the characterization of these megasynthases. while genetic methods in native hosts are critical in elucidation of the function of fungal nrps, in vitro assays of intact heterologously expressed proteins provide deeper mechanistic insights in nrps enzymology. our previous work in the study of nrps takes advantage of saccharomyces cerevisiae strain bj5464-npga as a robust and versatile platform for characterization of fungal nrpss. here we describe the use of yeast recombination strategies in s. cerevisiae for cloning of the nrps coding sequence in 2 mu-based expression vector; the use of affinity chromatography for purification of nrps from the total s. cerevisiae soluble protein fraction; and strategies for reconstitution of nrpss activities in vitro.
fluid_mechanics	in fluid mechanics, how to solve multiple solutions in ordinary differential equations is always a concerned and difficult problem. an improved rna genetic algorithm inspired by rna molecular structure and operators is proposed for solving the parameter estimation problems of the multiple solutions that described as the flow of the fluid through a porous channel with expanding or contracting walls. in this paper, multiple solutions can be found through changing accuracy and search coverage and multi-iterations of computer. at last, the ordinary differential equations is calculated, and the result has great accuracy and this method is practical.

strength_of_materials	csp solar fields are designed as lightweight structures. nevertheless, due to their size and complexity, large amounts of materials are required. environmental conditions like wind loads are a key driver for the design of solar fields, including required strength of materials and therefore mass. to give a solid example: structural steel work for the solar field of a 500,000 m(2) aperture parabolic trough plant (typical 50 mw plant in spain with 7 h thermal storage) amounts to approx. 12,500 tons of steel. due to changes in european design codes and the respective loading conditions, the design wind speed increased from 34 m/s to 38 m/s, which increases solar field structural steel mass to 14,450 tons, i.e. by about 16 %. obviously, prescribed load conditions have a tremendous effect on steel mass and hence cost and environmental impact. unfortunately, load description in many tender specifications is insufficiently accurate, what often results in confusion or even in significant errors in planning and construction, or higher risks. the paper describes various environmental loading effects, mainly wind, for parabolic trough and heliostat collector fields.

genetics	the potential impact of using human genetic data linked to longitudinal electronic medical records on drug development is extraordinary; however, the practical application of these data necessitates some organizational innovations. vanderbilt has created resources such as an easily queried database of >2.6 million de-identified electronic health records linked to biovu, which is a dna biobank with more than 230,000 unique samples. to ensure these data are used to maximally benefit and accelerate both de novo drug discovery and drug repurposing efforts, we created the accelerating drug development and repurposing incubator, a multidisciplinary think tank of experts in various therapeutic areas within both basic and clinical science as well as experts in legal, business, and other operational domains. the incubator supports a diverse pipeline of drug indication finding projects, leveraging the natural experiment of human genetics.
polymerase_chain_reaction	backgroundnovel fusion transcripts (fts) caused by chromosomal rearrangement are common factors in the development of cancers. in the current study, the authors used massively parallel rna sequencing to identify new fts in colon cancers. methodsrna sequencing (rna-seq) and tophat-fusion were used to identify new fts in colon cancers. the authors then investigated whether the novel ft nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group a, member 2 (nr5a2)-kelch-like family member 29 ft (klhl29ft) was transcribed from a genomic chromosomal rearrangement. next, the expression of nr5a2-klhl29ft was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in colon cancers and matched corresponding normal epithelia. resultsthe authors identified the ft nr5a2-klhl29ft in normal and cancerous epithelia. while investigating this transcript, it was unexpectedly found that it was due to an uncharacterized polymorphic germline insertion of the nr5a2 sequence from chromosome 1 into the klhl29 locus at chromosome 2, rather than a chromosomal rearrangement. this germline insertion, which occurred at a population frequency of 0.40, appeared to bear no relationship to cancer development. moreover, expression of nr5a2-klhl29ft was validated in rna specimens from samples with insertions of nr5a2 at the klhl29 gene locus, but not from samples without this insertion. it is interesting to note that nr5a2-klh29ft expression levels were significantly lower in colon cancers than in matched normal colonic epithelia (p =.029), suggesting the potential participation of nr5a2-klhl29ft in the origin or progression of this tumor type. conclusionsnr5a2-klhl29ft was generated from a polymorphism insertion of the nr5a2 sequence into the klhl29 locus. nr5a2-klhl29ft may influence the origin or progression of colon cancer. moreover, researchers should be aware that similar fts may occur due to transchromosomal insertions that are not correctly annotated in genome databases, especially with current assembly algorithms. cancer 2017;123:1507-1515. (c) 2017 american cancer society. a novel fusion transcript identified by rna sequencing, nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group a, member 2 (nr5a2)-kelch-like family member 29 fusion transcript (klhl29ft), was generated from a polymorphism insertion at the klhl29 locus instead of a chromosome rearrangement. the expression of nr5a2-klhl29ft appears to be lower in colon cancers than in matched normal tissues, suggesting potential participation of nr5a2-klhl29ft in the origin or progression of colon cancer.
northern_blotting	background: nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappa b), a transcription factor, is abundantly expressed in many tumors and regulates many tumor-relative genes such as c-myc and caspase-8, which nf-kappa b-mediated genes activation serves as an anti-tumor pathway by regulating expression of these tumor-relative genes. given the important roles of these genes in tumor control, the present study was to test the hypothesis that nf-kappa b decoy odns transfected into tumor cells in vitro and in vivo might affect growth and apoptosis. methods: first, nf-kappa b decoy oligodeoxynucleotides were designed according to the nf-kappa b elements in the promoter region of c-myc gene. then, supression effects of decoy odns on proliferation of five carcinoma cell lines were assessed by mtt assay. apoptosis of carcinoma cells was determined by chromosome dna ladder and flow cytometric analysis (fcm). thirdly, suppression effects of nf-kappa b decoy odns on proliferation of carcinoma in vivo were investigated in nude mice. to confirm mechanisms of action, a pgl3-c-myc luciferase expression vector containing a fragment of the c-myc promoter was constructed and co-transfected with nf-kappa b decoy odns into skov-3 cells by lipofectaminetm2000. expression levels of endogenous c-myc and caspase-8 genes were assessed by northern blotting. lastly, nuclear extracts were prepared from skov-3 cells and dna-protein interactions were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa). results: treatment of cancer cell lines with nf-kappa b decoy odns resulted in strong suppression of proliferation, especial of the skov-3 ovarian cancer cell line in vitro and in vivo. induction of apoptosis of skov-3 was observed in dna gel electrophoresis and fcm. activity of luciferase was significantly reduced in the nf-kappa b decoy-transfected cells, but not in cells transfected with a control decoy. furthermore, we found that transcripts of endogenous c-myc gene were reduced, while caspase-8 transcripts were induced. emsa demonstrated specific binding of the nf-kappa b decoy to nf-kappa b protein. conclusions: these findings indicatd that nf-kappa b activation plays an important role in proliferation in many cancers, esspecially ovarian carcinomas. inhibitors of nf-kappa b may thus offer promise as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of tumors via manipulating expression of desired target genes. nf-kappa b decoy odns may allow development of therapeutic and investigative tools for human malignancies.
immunology	objective: long-term prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) remains poor owing to the lack of treatment options for advanced hcc. cytokine-induced killer (cik) cells are ex vivo expanded t lymphocytes expressing both nk- and t-cell markers. cik cell therapy alone is insufficient for treating advanced hcc. thus, this study aimed to determine whether treatment with cik cells combined with valproic acid (vpa) could provide a synergistic effect to inhibit tumor growth in a mouse model of hcc. methods: upregulation of natural killer group 2d (nkg2d) ligands (retinoic acid early inducible 1 [rae-1], mouse; major histocompatibility complex class i polypeptide-related sequence a [mic-a], human) were evaluated by facs. vpa concentrations that did not reduce tumor volume were calculated to avoid vpa cytotoxicity in a c3h mouse model of hcc. cik cells were generated from mouse splenocytes using interferon gamma, a cd3 monoclonal antibody, and interleukin 2. the potential synergistic effect of cik cells combined with vpa was evaluated in the mouse model and tissue pathology was investigated. results: after 40h of incubation with vpa, rae-1 and mic-a expression were increased in 4 hcc cell lines compared with that in control (2.3-fold in mh-134, 2.4-fold in huh-7, 3.7-fold in snu-761, and 6.5-fold in snu-475). the maximal in vivo vpa dosage that showed no significant cytotoxicity compared with control was 10mg/kg/day. cik cells were well generated from c3h mouse splenocytes. after 7d of treatment with cik cells plus vpa, a synergistic effect was observed on relative tumor volume in the mouse model of hcc. while the relative tumor volume in untreated control mice increased to 11.25, that in the combination treatment group increased to only 5.20 (p = 0.047). conclusions: the vpa-induced increase in nkg2d ligands expression significantly enhanced the effects of cik cell therapy in a mouse model of hcc.
fluid_mechanics	given the facts that a vast area of the earth is covered by water and the average depth of the oceans is more than 3,000 m, the issue of the unknowns beneath the water surface is a challenging and questionable one. it has been a few decades since remotely operated vehicles as well as untethered underwater robots have appeared and elevated the level of complex engineering. in this category, underwater robots that mimic fish and aquatic creatures open new horizons. in this article, imitating the body shape, kinematics, and swimming mechanism of a batoid fish (dasyatidae), a vessel is designed that can swim at an acceptable speed with a limited amount of power. the hull shape is based on a cardioid curve, and drag force is calculated using fundamentals of fluid mechanics. propulsion of the robot-fish is two wings at starboard and port that are undulating backward; thrust is approximated versus shaft speed. finally, the power for swimming at the design speed is evaluated and compared with the available data of similar orders of magnitude.
fluid_mechanics	cavitation distribution in a high intensity focused ultrasound sonoreactors (hifu) has been extensively described in the recent literature, including quantification by an optical method (sonochemiluminescence scl). the present paper provides complementary measurements through the study of acoustic streaming generated by the same kind of hifu transducers. to this end, results of mass transfer measurements (electrodiffusional method) were compared to optical method ones (particle image velocimetry). this last one was used in various configurations: with or without an electrode in the acoustic field in order to have the same perturbation of the wave propagation. results show that the maximum velocity is not located at the focal but shifted near the transducer, and that this shift is greater for high powers. the two cavitation modes (stationary and moving bubbles) are greatly affect the hydrodynamic behavior of our sonoreactors: acoustic streaming and the fluid generated by bubble motion. the results obtained by electrochemical measurements show the same low hydrodynamic activity in the transducer vicinity, the same shift of the active focal toward the transducer, and the same absence of activity in the post-focal axial zone. the comparison with theoretical eckart 's velocities (acoustic streaming in non-cavitating media) confirms a very high activity at the ""sonochemical focal"", accounted for by wave distortion, which induced greater absorption coefficients. moreover, the equivalent liquid velocities are one order of magnitude larger than the ones measured by ply, confirming the enhancement of mass transfer by bubbles oscillation and collapse close to the surface, rather than from a pure streaming effect.

genetics	the dystonias are a group of disorders characterized by excessive muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and postures. there are many different clinical manifestations and underlying causes. deep brain stimulation (dbs) provides an effect treatment, but outcomes can vary considerably among the different subtypes of dystonia. several variables are thought to contribute to this variation including age of onset and duration of dystonia, specific characteristics of the dystonic movements, location of stimulation and stimulator settings, and others. the potential contributions of genetic factors have received little attention. in this review, we summarize evidence that some of the variation in dbs outcomes for dystonia is due to genetic factors. the evidence suggests that more methodical genetic testing may provide useful information in the assessment of potential surgical candidates, and in advancing our understanding of the biological mechanisms that influence dbs outcomes.
enzymology	a specific and sensitive substrate for the assay of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (cellulase) has been prepared. the substrate mixture comprises benzylidene end-blocked 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-cellotrioside (bzcnpg3) in the presence of thermostable beta-glucosidase. hydrolysis by exo-acting enzymes such as beta-glucosidase and exo-beta-glucanase is prevented by the presence of the benzylidene group on the non-reducing end d-glucosyl residue. on hydrolysis by cellulase, the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-glycoside is immediately hydrolysed to 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol and free d-glucose by the b-glucosidase in the substrate mixture. the reaction is terminated and colour developed by the addition of a weak alkaline solution. the assay procedure is simple to use, specific, accurate, robust and readily adapted to automation. this procedure should find widespread applications in biomass enzymology and in the specific assay of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase in general.

polymerase_chain_reaction	little is known about consequences of spartina alterniflora invasion on soil sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb). this study compared the abundance, diversity, and community structure of srb in s. alterniflora and in native plant communities along a successional gradient (bare mudflat, young/mature s. alterniflora, suaeda salsa, and phragmites australis) in coastal salt marshes of eastern china. quantitative polymerase chain reaction of dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrb) gene was applied to assess srb abundance, and the diversity and composition of srb was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing of partial dsrb gene. we found that s. alterniflora had a significantly higher abundance and diversity of srb than native plant species. for all plant covers, desulfobacteraceae was the largest soil srb group, with a relative abundance of 33.6%, followed by desulfobulbaceae (29.2%). s. alterniflora showed a higher relative abundance of desulfobacteraceae (42.5%) than native species (29.5%) did. notably, s. alterniflora invasion decreased the relative abundance of a srb branch clustering with the thermophilic thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii. in conclusion, s. alterniflora invasion of the eastern coast of china has greatly increased the abundance and diversity of srb communities and altered their structure. this might further influence carbon mineralization and inhibit the production of methane in china 's coastal marshes.
human_metabolism	body-on-a-chip systems replicate the size relationships of organs, blood distribution and blood flow, in accordance with human physiology. when operated with tissues derived from human cell sources, these systems are capable of simulating human metabolism, including the conversion of a prodrug to its effective metabolite, as well as its subsequent therapeutic actions and toxic side-effects. the system also permits the measurement of human tissue electrical and mechanical reactions, which provide a measure of functional response. since these devices can be operated with human tissue samples or with in vitro tissues derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (ips), they can play a significant role in determining the success of new pharmaceuticals, without resorting to the use of animals. by providing a platform for testing in the context of human metabolism, as opposed to animal models, the systems have the potential to eliminate the use of animals in preclinical trials. this article will review progress made and work achieved as a direct result of the 2015 lush science prize in support of animal-free testing.
northern_blotting	the long-term cardiac effects of amiodarone resemble many aspects of hypothyroidism. the anti-arrhythmic potential of amiodarone may therefore be the result of a drug-induced, local hypothyroid-like condition. to investigate this controversial issue, we compared gene expression profiles in the hearts of rats treated with amiodarone with those of rats with hypothyroidism. wistar male rats were assigned to 3 groups (n = 6-8): control, systemic hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism) and amiodarone treatment (amiodarone, 150 mg/kg/day, p.o., 4 weeks). electrocardiogram (ecg) recordings, gene profiling by dna microarray and northern blotting were carried out. amiodarone, like hypothyroidism, caused significant prolongation of rr and qt intervals in ecgs. microarray analysis of 8435 genes in the left ventricular myocardium revealed a significant similarity in expression profiles between hypothyroidism and amiodarone (r=0.63, p<0.00001). the gene expression profiles of hypothyroidism and amiodarone showed closer correlation when top 100 up-regulated and 100 down-regulated genes in hypothyroidism, (total 200 genes)were analyzed (r=0.78,p<0.00001). northern blots of left ventricular myocardium, showed a parallel decrease in mrnas for myosin heavy chain (mhc)-alpha and a parallel increase for myosin heavy chain (mhc)-beta in hypothyroidism and amiodarone. in the liver and pituitary, in contrast, northern blots showed quite different changes in the transcripts of the representative t3-responsive genes in the hypothyroidism and amiodarone. in conclusion, long-term treatment with amiodarone causes cardioselective hypothyroid-like alterations in gene expression profiles. the potent anti-arrhythmic activity of amiodarone may be attributable, in part at least, to this unique transcriptional remodeling.

cell_biology	melatonin affects a variety of physiological processes including circadian rhythms, cellular redox status, and immune function. importantly, melatonin significantly influences t-cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial to protect mammals against cancers and infections, but are associated with pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. this review focuses on our current understanding of the significance of melatonin in t-cell biology and the beneficial effects of melatonin in t-cell response-based diseases. in addition to expressing both membrane and nuclear receptors for melatonin, t cells have the four enzymes required for the synthesis of melatonin and produce high levels of melatonin. meanwhile, melatonin is highly effective in modulating t-cell activation and differentiation, especially for th17 and treg cells, and also memory t cells. mechanistically, the influence of melatonin in t-cell biology is associated with membrane and nuclear receptors as well as receptor-independent pathways, for example, via calcineurin. several cell signaling pathways, including erk1/2-c/ebp alpha, are involved in the regulatory roles of melatonin in t-cell biology. through modulation in t-cell responses, melatonin exerts beneficial effects in various inflammatory diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. these findings highlight the importance of melatonin signaling in t-cell fate determination, and t cell-based immune pathologies.
southern_blotting	molecular pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) is largely associated with mutational changes in the braf, ras family and ret genes. our aim was to assess clinico-pathological and prognostic correlations of these ptc-specific gene alterations, with a particular emphasis on the braf mutation, in a group of 266 serbian ptc patients, for the first time. the reference center-based retrospective cohort included 201 (75.6%) females and 65 (24.4%) males aged 48.0 +/- 16.1 years (8-83 years old, range) diagnosed and treated for ptc during 1993-2008. follow-up period was 53.1 +/- 41.6 months (7-187 months, range). braf and ras mutations were determined by direct sequencing of genomic dna. ret/ptc rearrangements were analyzed by rt-pcr/southern blotting. genetic alterations were detected in 150/266 tumors (56.4%). one tumor displayed two genetic alterations. the braf(v600e) was found in 84/266 (31.6%) cases, ras mutations in 11/266(4.1%) and ret/ptc in 55/266(20.7%; 42/266 (15.8%)ret/ptc1 and 13/266 (4.9%)ret/ptc3). on multivariate analysis braf(v600e) was associated with the classical papillary morphology (p = 0.05), the higher pt category (p = 0.05) and advanced clinical stage (p = 0.03). in a proportional hazard model, braf(v600e) did not appear to be an independent risk factor for the faster recurrence (p = 0.784). we conclude that under the extensive thyroid surgery and limited application of radioiodine ablation braf(v600e) may not be an indicator of poorer disease-free survival during the short to middle follow-up period. however, it has a potential to contribute to patients stratification into high- and low-risk groups.
internal_combustion_engine	electric and hybrid electric vehicles (ev and hev) seem to be the future of transport in smart cities and the key for the total reduction of noise disturbance and pollution in urban areas. however, several problems have to be solved to guarantee the safety of these types of vehicle. up to now, the use of hev has shown the dangers of a ""quiet"" transport system in urban environments; in fact, it has been estimated that an hev is twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash as would be an internal combustion engine (ice) vehicle in the same situation. with the aim of improving their safety, different kinds of warning sounds are being designed to increase the detectability of ev and hev without themselves becoming new annoying sound sources. the sound directivity, frequency of emission and intensity of warning sound systems will guarantee their efficiency and limited noise impact. several research works bring to the fore a significant variation of the pedestrian response time to different acoustic stimuli. however, it is necessary to examine the suitability of these warning sounds according to the urban environments in which they are going to be emitted. distinct areas inside the city have different soundscapes whose spectral content can vary significantly, masking some of the sounds suggested as an alert. this paper analyses in detail the main characteristics of several warning sounds proposed by the industry, conducting a comparative study of the different design trends. a total of 131 sighted listeners were exposed to a virtual road-crossing test. the behaviour and appropriateness of warning sounds are analysed depending on the urban environment. for this purpose, three clearly different soundscapes have been selected: stopped vehicles at a traffic light, a pedestrian shopping area and the vicinity of a playground. the results highlight the wide variability in pedestrian reaction time for the different warning sounds used. some signals considerably improve the detectability of the vehicle, providing results even above the ice vehicle ones. however, other warning sounds do not decrease the reaction time with respect to the ev. in addition, a clear dependence is observed between the detectability and the soundscape involved, changing the results for the same warning sound depending on the acoustic environment.

fluid_mechanics	data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut are considered key parameters in the control and matching of production in each layer of intelligent well wellbores. owing to the complicated conditions in the downhole, no permanent downhole flowmeter is installed in the current simple intelligent well system of onshore oilfields in china. furthermore, necessary real-time data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer cannot be obtained. on the basis of mass conservation equation, momentum conservation equation, and theories of heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics in porous medium, this study establishes the energy conservation equation of fluids in the tubing and annulus. by using the single-point real-time data of the pressure and temperature in the tubing and annulus, the temperature gradient in each producing layer can be deduced. moreover, the temperature profile, data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer can be calculated. this approach is used to solve the problem of flow measurement in each producing layer of intelligent well systems without permanent downhole flowmeters in onshore chinese oilfields. according to the production data of intelligent well lei 632, the temperature distribution along the wellbore is analyzed, the water yield formation is diagnosed, and the reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer are calculated. the analytic solution of the method agrees well with that of the conventional production logging, thus indicating the feasibility of the method in realizing the dynamic monitoring of intelligent wells and in solving the actual problem in real time. the proposed method fills in the gaps in theories on intelligent well technology in china.

hydraulics	plant transpiration is the main evaporative flux from terrestrial ecosystems; it controls land surface energy balance, determines catchment hydrological responses and influences regional and global climate. transpiration regulation by plants is a key (and still not completely understood) process that underlies vegetation drought responses and land evaporative fluxes under global change scenarios. thermometric methods of sap flow measurement have now been widely used to quantify whole-plant and stand transpiration in forests, shrublands and orchards around the world. a large body of research has applied sap flow methods to analyse seasonal and diurnal patterns of transpiration and to quantify their responses to hydroclimatic variability, but syntheses of sap flow data at regional to global scales are extremely rare. here we present the sapfluxnet initiative, aimed at building the first global database of plant-level sap flow measurements. a preliminary metadata survey launched in december 2015 showed an encouraging response by the sap flow community, with sap flow data sets from field studies representing >160 species and >120 globally distributed sites. the main goal of sapfluxnet is to analyse the ecological factors driving plant-and stand-level transpiration. sapfluxnet will open promising research avenues at an unprecedented global scope, namely: (i) exploring the spatio-temporal variability of plant transpiration and its relationship with plant and stand attributes, (ii) summarizing physiological regulation of transpiration by means of few water-use traits, usable for land surface models, (iii) improving our understanding of the coordination between gas exchange and plant-level traits (e.g., hydraulics) and (iv) analysing the ecological factors controlling stand transpiration and evapotranspiration partitioning. finally, sapfluxnet can provide a benchmark to test models of physiological controls of transpiration, contributing to improve the accuracy of individual water stress responses, a key element to obtain robust predictions of vegetation responses to climate change.
immunology	in many wild animal populations, hosts are at risk of parasites and malnutrition and resource costs of defence may be difficult to afford. we postulate that proteins, important in homeostasis and immunity, play a complex but central role in condition dependence and resource costs of mammalian immune defence. to test this, we measured plasma concentrations of albumin, total proteins. self-reactive antibodies and parasite-specific igg in female soay sheep. using a principal component analysis, we found a new metric of condition reflecting individual variation in acquisition, assimilation and/or recycling of plasma proteins that predicted overwinter survival. controlling for this metric, an age-dependent trade-off between antibody titres and protein reserves emerged, indicating costs of mounting an antibody response: younger individuals survived best when prioritising immunity while older individuals fared better when maintaining high-protein nutritional plane. these findings suggest fascinating roles for protein acquisition and allocation in influencing survival in wild animal populations.
computer-aided_design	a compelling, innovative approach to teaching gross anatomy is the use of computer-aided holographic models. they allow for clean, time-saving dissection, manipulation of structures and appreciation of anatomical relationships, and potential elimination of the need for cadavers. the present study tests the hypothesis that using holographic models improves mastery of anatomical information. first-year medical students were taught gross anatomy using the dissection of donor cadavers, manipulation of digitized 3-dimensional holographic renderings, and examination of plastinated specimens. the effectiveness of these approaches was assessed by comparing students' performance on identification questions on cadavers (qc), holographic models (qh), and plastinated specimens (qp). students in the top quintile of the class performed strongly on qc, qh, and qp. in contrast, performance by students in the bottom quintile was uneven; they scored best on qh. performance on the qp was relatively non-discriminating. students in the top quintile scored higher on the biological sciences section of the medical college admission test (mcat) than students in the lowest quintile, whereas students in the lowest quintile had higher scores on the verbal section of their mcats. the availability of different approaches for presenting gross anatomy improves the success of students in mastering the material, particularly for students struggling with the information. the use of holographic models apparently reaches students who may be challenged to learn the material using traditional approaches. this may be linked to potentially predictive information gleaned through performance on the mcat. clin. anat. 29:917-924, 2016.

enzymology	the ability to undergo non-oxidative metabolism from ethanol to fatty acid ethyl esters (faees) varies greatly among tissues and organs. to gain a greater understanding of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism to faee, we aimed to collect all published data on faee synthesis in mammalian organs and tissues to identify all tissues, organs, and enzymes that are known to, or likely possess faee-synthetic activity. a systematic search for relevant papers was performed and two independent reviewers examined potentially relevant abstracts (articles on faees that pertain to ethanol exposure) to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. information on faee synthesis was retrieved from papers meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and summarized by organ/tissue/matrix examined. the systematic search through four databases yielded 78 articles that investigated faee synthesis by tissues, tissue fractions and cell lines, and 29 articles that attempted to purify and/or characterize the enzymes involved in faee synthesis. two enzyme activities have been studied: faee synthase (faees, which conjugates ethanol and free fatty acid) and acyl-coa: ethanol o-acyltransferase (aeat, which conjugates ethanol and fatty acyl-coa). both activities are expressed by a variety of different enzymes. faees activity is the most widely studied and has been purified from several tissues and shown to be associated with several well-known enzymes, while the identity of enzymes possessing aeat activity remains unknown. the organs and tissues that have been shown to synthesize faees are discussed, with special emphasis on the studies that attempted to elucidate the enzymology of faee synthesis in those tissues.
southern_blotting	non-heading chinese cabbage (brassica rapa l. ssp. chinensis) is a popular vegetable in asian countries. the diamondback moth (dbm), plutella xylostella (l.), an insect with worldwide distribution, is a main pest of brassicaceae crops and causes enormous crop losses. transfer of the anti-insect gene into the plant genome by transgenic technology and subsequent breeding of insect-resistant varieties will be an effective approach to reducing the damage caused by this pest. we have produced transgenic non-heading chinese cabbage plants expressing the potato proteinase inhibitor ii gene (pinii) and tested the pest resistance of these transgenic plants. non-heading chinese cabbages grown for 45 days on which buds had formed were used as experimental materials for agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration transformation. forty-one resistant plants were selected from 1166 g of seed harvested from the infiltrated plants based on the resistance of the young seedlings to the herbicide basta. the transgenic traits were further confirmed by the chlorophenol red test, pcr, and genomic southern blotting. the results showed that the bar and pinii genes were co-integrated into the resistant plant genome. a bioassay of insect resistance in the second generation of individual lines of the transgenic plants showed that dbm larvae fed on transgenic leaves were severely stunted and had a higher mortality than those fed on the wild-type leaves.
molecular_biology	several clinical trials have demonstrated that some patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (cml-cp) who achieve sustained deep molecular responses on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) therapy can safely suspend therapy and attempt treatment-free remission (tfr). many tfr studies to date have enrolled imatinib-treated patients; however, the feasibility of tfr following nilotinib or dasatinib has also been demonstrated. in this review, we discuss available data from tfr trials and what these data reveal about the molecular biology of tfr. with an increasing number of ongoing tfr clinical trials, tfr may become an achievable goal for patients with cml-cp.
strength_of_materials	the calculation formulas for concrete and steel utilization rate of reinforcing layer have been deduced, in view of the underutilization of reinforcing layer material by composite main arch circle method. the calculation formulas is defined as load bearing capacity of reinforcing layer divided by the ultimate bearing capacity of reinforcing layer, combined with initial strain of main arch ring before reinforcement and reinforcing layer section edge strain, take compression zone partial of reinforcing layer subjected to tension and compression as example. the calculation formulas for concrete utilization rate of reinforcing layer is divided into 2 types according to the height of compression zone and on the edge of compressive strain in the reinforcing layer, the calculation formulas for steel utilization rate of reinforcing layer is divided into 1 types according to tension strain of the steel. the results show that controlling the stress and strain of stone arch bridge before reinforcement can make full use of compression resistance on main arch ring, strength of materials and reduce the waste of materials relying on engineering example. the calculation formulas provide the theoretical basis for calculation and design of the similar reinforcement structure.
internal_combustion_engine	this work addresses the potential for waste energy recovery from exhaust gases in a diesel passenger car mounted in a chassis dynamometer. the new european driving cycle was followed, while recording relevant operating variables. tests were performed under three temperature conditions, and exergy analysis was included to find the potential of exhaust gases to produce useful work at six points in the exhaust system. results include mean temperature at each point, as well as the energy quality index, which was lower than 33%, meaning that less than one-third of the energy of exhaust gases can be converted into useful work in a recovery system. in general, the highest exergy losses were found in the muffler. although the greatest recovery potential corresponds to the highest temperature of gases, environmental regulations for vehicles restrict waste energy recovery to be performed downstream after-treatment devices, which, in the present work, was the outlet of the diesel particle filter. temperature of gases at this location varied in the range 115-320 degrees c, and potential fuel saving varied between 8% and 19% for the complete driving cycle.

hydraulics	modeling individual fish habitat selection in highly variable environments such as hydropeaking rivers is required for guiding efficient management decisions. we analyzed fish microhabitat selection in the heterogeneous hydraulic and thermal conditions (modeled in two-dimensions) of a reach of the large hydropeaking rhone river locally warmed by the cooling system of a nuclear power plant. we used modern fixed acoustic telemetry techniques to survey 18 fish individuals (five barbels, six catfishes, seven chubs) signaling their position every 3 s over a three-month period. fish habitat selection depended on combinations of current microhabitat hydraulics (e.g. velocity, depth), past microhabitat hydraulics (e.g. dewatering risk or maximum velocities during the past 15 days) and to a lesser extent substrate and temperature. mixed-effects habitat selection models indicated that individual effects were often stronger than specific effects. in the rhone, fish individuals appear to memorize spatial and temporal environmental changes and to adopt a ""least constraining"" habitat selection. avoiding fast flowing midstream habitats, fish generally live along the banks in areas where the dewatering risk is high. when discharge decreases, however, they select higher velocities but avoid both dewatering areas and very fast-flowing midstream habitats. although consistent with the available knowledge on static fish habitat selection, our quantitative results demonstrate temporal variations in habitat selection, depending on individual behavior and environmental history. their generality could be further tested using comparative experiments in different environmental configurations.

southern_blotting	to study the calmodulin (cam) signal transduction pathway of gracilaria lemaneiformis under heat stress, peptidase (denoted as metalloprotease of g. lemaneiformis (glmp)), a calmodulin-binding protein of g. lemaneiformis was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. the full complementary dna (cdna) and genomic dna encoding glmp was obtained by using rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) and genome walking techniques, respectively. the dna sequence of glmp consisted of 1,130 nucleotides, containing an open reading frame (orf) of 462 nucleotides, with an intron of 71 nucleotides. the orf of the isolated glmp was predicted to encode 153 amino acids, including the zinc metalloprotease hexxh consensus motif characteristic of glmp. southern blotting indicated that there were two copies of glmp in g. lemaneiformis. the yeast two-hybrid results showed that the expressed glmp could interact with cam, proving that glmp was a type of calmodulin-binding protein. next, the transcription of cam and glmp of g. lemaneiformis was analyzed by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) under heat shock of 28 and 32 a degrees c. the expression level displayed a cyclical upward trend. these results indicate that glmp and cam may play important roles in high-temperature tolerance of g. lemaneiformis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	cell transfer between mother and fetus were demonstrated previously in several species which possess haemochorial placenta (e.g. in humans, mice, rats, etc.). here we report the assessment of fetal and maternal microchimerism in non-transgenic (non-tg) new zealand white rabbits which were pregnant with transgenic (tg) fetuses and in non-tg newborns of tg does. the tg construct, including the venus fluorophore cdna driven by a ubiquitous cytomegalovirus enhancer, chicken -actin promoter (caggs), was previously integrated into the rabbit genome by sleeping beauty transposon system. three different methods [fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr)] were employed to search for tg cells and gene products in blood and other tissues of non-tg rabbits. venus positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were not detected in the blood of non-tg littermates or non-tg does by flow cytometry. tissue samples (liver, kidney, skeletal and heart muscle) also proved to be venus negative examined with fluorescence microscopy, while histology sections and pbmcs of tg rabbits showed robust venus protein expression. in case of genomic dna (gdna) sourced from tissue samples of non-tg rabbits, caggs promoter-specific fragments could not be amplified by qpcr. our data showed the lack of detectable cell transfer between tg and non-tg rabbits during gestation.
strength_of_materials	the structural integrity of multi-component structures is usually determined by the strength and durability of their unions. adhesive bonding is often chosen over welding, riveting and bolting, due to the reduction of stress concentrations, reduced weight penalty and easy manufacturing, amongst other issues. in the past decades, the finite element method (fem) has been used for the simulation and strength prediction of bonded structures, by strength of materials or fracture mechanics-based criteria. cohesive-zone models (czms) have already proved to be an effective tool in modelling damage growth, surpassing a few limitations of the aforementioned techniques. despite this fact, they still suffer from the restriction of damage growth only at predefined growth paths. the extended finite element method (xfem) is a recent improvement of the fem, developed to allow the growth of discontinuities within bulk solids along an arbitrary path, by enriching degrees of freedom with special displacement functions, thus overcoming the main restriction of czms. these two techniques were tested to simulate adhesively bonded single- and double-lap joints. the comparative evaluation of the two methods showed their capabilities and/or limitations for this specific purpose.

northern_blotting	mac-2 binding protein (mac-2bp) is a secreted tumor antigen that is elevated in many cancers and implicated in tumor metastasis, as well as cell adhesion and immune functions. we focused on the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (htert) induced mac-2bp expression and the relationship between mac-2bp expression and the progression of gastric cancer. a cdna expression array analysis was performed on the telomerase-negative cell line, sw13, which was engineered to overexpress htert when compared with the parental sw13 cell. htert-induced mac-2bp expression was confirmed via rt-pcr and northern blotting. elisa and flow cytometric analyses revealed that mac-2bp protein was increased by 2- to 4-fold in htert-overexpressing cells compared with the mock control. mac-2bp expression was significantly reduced when the overexpressed htert was neutralized by the introduction of htert-specific sirna. these results suggest that mac-2bp expression is modulated by htert. mac-2bp levels in both gastric cancer cells and tumor tissues were determined via northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. mac-2bp protein was highly expressed in most gastric cancer cell lines, and gastric tumor tissues were stained more densely than normal tissues. the intracellular and secreted mac-2bp levels were also evaluated ilia elisa, indicating that mac-2bp was expressed and secreted more abundantly in gastric cancer patients than in healthy donors. the elevated serum mac-2bp level in gastric tumor patients was also significantly associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.05) and higher tumor stage (p = 0.04). our findings suggest that mac-2bp is induced by htert. and that it may prove to be a useful prognostic marker for the detection of malignant progression of metastatic stomach cancers.

fluid_mechanics	in 2008, the first commercial wave farm came online in portugal. as with other types of renewable energy, the electricity obtained from waves has the drawback of intermittency. knowing a few hours ahead how much energy waves will hold can contribute to a better management of the electricity grid. in this work, three types of statistical models have been used to create up to 24-h forecasts of the zonal and meridional components of wave energy flux (wef) levels at three directional buoys located off the coast in the bay of biscay. each model 's performance has been compared at a 95% confidence level with the simplest prediction (persistence of levels), along with the forecasts provided by the physics-based wave modeling (wam) wave model at the nearest grid point. the results indicate that for forecasting horizons between 3 and roughly 16 h ahead, the statistical models built on random forests (rfs) outperform the rest, including wam and persistence.
polymerase_chain_reaction	introduction: tuberculosis (tb) is a leading killer worldwide. end tb strategy aims at ending the tb epidemic by 2030. early, accurate, and affordable diagnosis represents a cornerstone to achieve this goal. innovative strategies for tb diagnostics have been introduced. however, the ideal assay is yet unavailable and conventional methods remain necessary for diagnosis. unique properties of nanoparticles (nps) have allowed their utilization in tb detection via targeting disease biomarkers.area covered: until now, around thirty-five tb np-based assays have been partially or fully characterized. accuracy, low-cost, and short time-to-result represent the common properties of proposed platforms. tb nanodiagnostics now encompass almost all clinical aspects of the disease including active tb, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, rifampicin resistant tb, tb/hiv co-infection, latent tb, and extra-pulmonary tb. this review summarizes state-of-the-art knowledge of tb nanodiagnostics for the last 10years. special consideration is given for fabrication concepts, detection strategies, and clinical performance using various clinical specimens. the potential of tb nanodiagnostics to fulfill the need for ideal mtb testing is assessed.expert commentary: tb nanodiagnostics show promise to be ideal detection tools that can meet the rigorous demands to end the tb epidemic by 2030.
molecular_biology	model animals are crucial to biomedical research. among the commonly used model animals, the amphibian, xenopus, has had tremendous impact because of its unique experimental advantages, cost effectiveness, and close evolutionary relationship with mammals as a tetrapod. over the past 50years, the use of xenopus has made possible many fundamental contributions to biomedicine, and it is a cornerstone of research in cell biology, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, immunology, molecular biology, neurobiology, and physiology. the prospects for xenopus as an experimental system are excellent: xenopus is uniquely well-suited for many contemporary approaches used to study fundamental biological and disease mechanisms. moreover, recent advances in high throughput dna sequencing, genome editing, proteomics, and pharmacological screening are easily applicable in xenopus, enabling rapid functional genomics and human disease modeling at a systems level.
genetics	canine influenza is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by two subtypes (h3n2 and h3n8) of canine influenza virus (civ). currently, only inactivated influenza vaccines (itvs) are available for the prevention of civs. historically, live-attenuated influenza vaccines (laivs) have been shown to produce better immunogenicity and protection efficacy than iivs. here, we have engineered a civ h3n2 law by using the internal genes of a previously described civ h3n8 law as a master donor virus (mdv) and the surface ha and na genes of a circulating civ h3n2 strain. our findings show that civ h3n2 law replicates efficiently at low temperature but its replication is impaired at higher temperatures. the civ h3n2 laiv was attenuated in vivo but induced better protection efficacy in mice against challenge with wild-type civ h3n2 than a commercial civ h3n2 iiv. this is the first description of a laiv for the prevention of civ h3n2 in dogs.
manufacturing_engineering	in order to satisfy the requirements of productivity and quality, in recent years, laser welding processes of certain grades of steels mainly thin sheets assemblies or tailored welded blanks (twbs) have given many successful advantages in manufacturing engineering. this welding process of in particular makes it possible very easily to joint the steel parts in thickness and grade identical or different in many industrial applications (car industry, pipe lines, tubes, etc.). additionally, interstitial free (if) steels with very low c and n contents have been successfully developed in order to perform specific or complex deep drawing operations in the automotive industry. major developments of twb by means of laser welding in this area have also occurred. certain grades of if steel are particularly suitable for deep drawing operations of twb due to high r values (lankford ratio) [grumbach, m., sanz, g., 1972. ductile-brittle tests by impact tensile test (itt). j. metall. 2, 145-164; bayraktar, e., kaplan, d., buirette, c., grumbach, m., 2004. application of impact tensile testing to the welded thin sheets. j. mater. process. technol. 145 (1), 27-39; bayraktar, e., kaplan, d., hugele, d., jansen, j.p., 2004. evaluation of pipe line laser girth weld properties by charpy and impact tensile tests. j. mater. process. technol. 147 (11), 155-162; bayraktar, e., kaplan, d., grumbach, m., 2004. application of impact tensile testing to the spot welded sheets. j. mater. process. technol. 153, 80-86]. however, because of the narrowness of the weld bead and important hardness gradient, determination of ""toughness"" (definition of a criterion of the ""ductile/brittle"" transition during the impact test) of the welded connection (weld bead and heat affected zone) confirm very delicate in laser welding. the main objective of this paper was to make a comparative study for microstructural and mechanical-toughness characterisation of the steel assemblies, base metal or welded by laser. for that a procedure of test specifically adapted was used for welded joints (t < 4mm). the first part of this study consider different steel grades such as a grade of the fe360bfn steel (t = 4 mm) and a grade of the interstitial free steel (if-ti, t = 0.8 mm) and hr60 (t = 2.5 mm) welded by laser that largely used in the automotive industry.

molecular_biology	cancer is a complex disease: its pathology cannot be properly understood in terms of independent players-genes, proteins, molecular pathways, or their simple combinations. this is similar to many-body physics of a condensed phase that many important properties are not determined by a single atom or molecule. the rapidly accumulating large 'omics' data also require a new mechanistic and global underpinning to organize for rationalizing cancer complexity. a unifying and quantitative theory was proposed by some of the present authors that cancer is a robust state formed by the endogenous molecular-cellular network, which is evolutionarily built for the developmental processes and physiological functions. cancer state is not optimized for the whole organism. the discovery of crucial players in cancer, together with their developmental and physiological roles, in turn, suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure within molecular biology systems. such a structure enables a decision network to be constructed from experimental knowledge. by examining the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of the network, robust states corresponding to normal physiological and abnormal pathological phenotypes, including cancer, emerge naturally. the nonlinear dynamical model of the network leads to a more encompassing understanding than the prevailing linear-additive thinking in cancer research. so far, this theory has been applied to prostate, hepatocellular, gastric cancers and acute promyelocytic leukemia with initial success. it may offer an example of carrying physics inquiring spirit beyond its traditional domain: while quantitative approaches can address individual cases, however there must be general rules/laws to be discovered in biology and medicine.
molecular_biology	berberine is traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal (gi) motility disorders. the interstitial cells of cajal (iccs) are the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract, which are responsible for the production of gut movements. the present study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine on pacemaker potentials (pps) in cultured icc clusters from the mouse small intestine, and sought to identify the receptors involved and the underlying mechanisms of action. all experiments were performed on cultured iccs, and a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record pps from icc clusters (current clamp mode). under current clamp mode, berberine was shown to decrease the amplitude and frequency of pps. however, these effects were suppressed by treatment with glibenclamide, a specific atp-sensitive k+ channel blocker. nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride (a kappa opioid receptor antagonist) did not suppress berberine-induced pp inhibition, whereas ici 174,864 (a delta opioid receptor antagonist) and ctop (a mu opioid receptor antagonist) did suppress the inhibitory effects of berberine. pretreatment with sq-22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) or with kt-5720 (a protein kinase a inhibitor) did not suppress the effects of berberine; however, pretreatment with 1h-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (a guanylate cyclase inhibitor) or kt-5823 [a protein kinase g (pkg) inhibitor] did. in addition, berberine stimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp) production in iccs. these observations indicate that berberine may inhibit the pacemaker activity of icc clusters via atp-sensitive k+ channels and the cgmp-pkg-dependent pathway by stimulating mu and delta opioid receptors. therefore, berberine may provide a basis for the development of novel agents for the treatment of gi motility dysfunction.
molecular_biology	breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. therapeutic treatments for breast cancer generally include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrinotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. with the development of molecular biology, immunology and pharmacogenomics, immunotherapy becomes a promising new field in breast cancer therapies. in this review, we discussed recent progress in breast cancer immunotherapy, including cancer vaccines, bispecific antibodies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. several additional immunotherapy modalities in early stages of development are also highlighted. it is believed that these new immunotherapeutic strategies will ultimately change the current status of breast cancer therapies.
genetics	aims genetic polymorphisms may contribute to platelet reactivity in diabetic patients; however, the information on their influence on long-term antiplatelet therapy is lacking. our aim was to evaluate the role of previously described genetic variants and platelet reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. methods blood samples were obtained from 303 caucasian patients. genome-wide genotyping was performed using illumina human omni 2.5-quad microarrays, and individual genotyping of selected snps was performed using a custom sequenom iplex assay in conjunction with the mass array platform. platelet reactivity was measured with verifynow aspirin assay and pfa-100 assay. univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of genetic variants and platelets reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. results among the 237 patients included in the follow-up, death from any cause occurred in 34 (14.3%) patients and cardiovascular events occurred in 51 (21.5%) patients within a median observation time of 71 months (5.9 years). in univariate analyses, significant association in the presence of minor alleles in txba2r (rs1131882) with primary (hr 2.54, 95% ci 1.15-5.60, p = 0.021) and secondary endpoint (hr 2.06, 95% ci 1.06-4.04, p = 0.034) was observed. in addition, multivariate analyses revealed the impact of this polymorphism on primary (hr 2.34, 95% ci 1.09-5.00, p = 0.029) and secondary endpoint (hr 1.89, 95% ci 1.00-3.57, p = 0.048). conclusions results of the study demonstrate for the first time an association between genetic polymorphism within txba2r gene encoding platelet 's surface receptor and long-term survival of diabetic patients treated with asa.
immunology	as the prevalence and socioeconomic burden of allergic rhinitis is steadily increasing every year, it is essential that clinical practitioners diagnose and manage allergic rhinitis in an evidence-based manner. therefore, the korean academy of asthma, allergy and clinical immunology developed new clinical guidelines for korean patients and practitioners. we first performed a questionnaire survey to address the core questions, about which clinical practitioners are the most curious. a large group of physicians (allergists), pediatricians, and otorhinolaryngologists developed answers for those questions by performing a systematic literature review and determining the appropriate levels of recommendation. in this article, we propose 11 answers for core questions regarding the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.
fluid_mechanics	effects of impeller configurations on docosahexaenoic acid production and flow characteristics were investigated by schizochytrium sp. in a 15 l bioreactor. 6-straight blade disc turbine (6-sbdt), 6-arrowy-blade disc turbine (6-abdt) and down-pumping propeller (dpp) were combined to form different impeller configurations. simulated results showed that configuration ssa consisting of upper two 6-sbdt and one bottom 6-abdt possessed the worst oxygen supply capacity. but it obtained the highest dha percentage of 48.17 % and dha yield of 21.42 g/l, indicating that it was beneficial for dha synthesis and converting glucose to biomass and lipids. configuration sas consisting of one middle 6-abdt and two 6-sbdt provided better mixing capacity, which resulted in the maximum glucose consumption rate of 2.86 g/l h and the highest biomass of 108.09 g/l. this study would improve insight into understanding the relationship between flow field and the physiology of schizochytrium sp. for the scale-up of industrial dha production.
molecular_biology	imaging of frster resonance energy transfer (fret) is a powerful tool for examining cell biology in real-time. studies utilizing fret commonly employ two-dimensional (2d) culture, which does not mimic the three-dimensional (3d) cellular microenvironment. a method to perform quenched emission fret imaging using conventional widefield epifluorescence microscopy of cells within a 3d hydrogel environment is presented. here an analysis method for ratiometric fret probes that yields linear ratios over the probe activation range is described. measurement of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) levels is demonstrated in chondrocytes under forskolin stimulation using a probe for epac1 activation (icue1) and the ability to detect differences in camp signaling dependent on hydrogel material type, herein a photocrosslinking hydrogel (pc-gel, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and a thermoresponsive hydrogel (tr-gel). compared with 2d fret methods, this method requires little additional work. laboratories already utilizing fret imaging in 2d can easily adopt this method to perform cellular studies in a 3d microenvironment. it can further be applied to high throughput drug screening in engineered 3d microtissues. additionally, it is compatible with other forms of fret imaging, such as anisotropy measurement and fluorescence lifetime imaging (flim), and with advanced microscopy platforms using confocal, pulsed, or modulated illumination.
human_metabolism	the effects of water-soluble nonstarch polysaccharides (snsp) on human metabolism are considered to be beneficial because they decrease postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia following ingestion of starch-rich foods. the mechanisms by which snsp attenuate the postprandial rise in blood glucose are not well understood but their presence increases the viscosity of gastrointestinal contents, which affects physiological functions, e.g. gastric emptying and peristalsis. increased viscosity and decreased water activity during hydrothermal treatment of starch could influence alpha-amylase action. using guar galactomannan as a representative of snsp, we found that galactomannan has a direct noncompetitive inhibitory effect on alpha-amylase with a k(i) value of approximately 0.5% (3.3 mum). the inhibition is not time dependent and studies suggest direct binding of the enzyme to galactomannan; the resulting galactomannan-amylase complex being inactive. processing of starch at low water levels greatly affects the catalytic efficiency of a-amylase. the k(m) value for starch heat treated in limited water is raised and k(cat) is lowered relative to starch gelatinised in excess water. since galactomannan has no effect on the k(m) of alpha-amylase, we conclude that the inhibitory action of the polymer is not secondary to a decrease in available water. neither does it seem to be a consequence of impaired diffusion of enzyme, substrate and products because of an increase in viscosity of the medium. thus, the effects of snsp in lowering postprandial glycaemia not only involve modifications of gut physiology, but also include direct inhibition of the first stage in the biochemical degradation of starch.

human_metabolism	altered metabolism is linked to the appearance of various human diseases and a better understanding of disease-associated metabolic changes may lead to the identification of novel prognostic biomarkers and the development of new therapies. genome-scale metabolic models (gems) have been employed for studying human metabolism in a systematic manner, as well as for understanding complex human diseases. in the past decade, such metabolic models - one of the fundamental aspects of systems biology - have started contributing to the understanding of the mechanistic relationship between genotype and phenotype. in this review, we focus on the construction of the human metabolic reaction database, the generation of healthy cell type- and cancer-specific gems using different procedures, and the potential applications of these developments in the study of human metabolism and in the identification of metabolic changes associated with various disorders. we further examine how in silico genome-scale reconstructions can be employed to simulate metabolic flux distributions and how high-throughput omics data can be analyzed in a context-dependent fashion. insights yielded from this mechanistic modeling approach can be used for identifying new therapeutic agents and drug targets as well as for the discovery of novel biomarkers. finally, recent advancements in genome-scale modeling and the future challenge of developing a model of whole-body metabolism are presented. the emergent contribution of gems to personalized and translational medicine is also discussed.
southern_blotting	three kpc-2-producing escherichia coli (e1, e2, and e3) were recovered from water samples of an urban river in the city of harbin, china. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution. molecular characterization and genetic relatedness of the isolates were determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and pcr-directed phylotyping. plasmids were analyzed by conjugation, s1-pfge, southern blotting and pcr-based replicon typing (pbrt). the genetic environment of the bla (kpc-2) gene was determined using pcr and sequencing. pcr analyses revealed that the e1 isolate carried the bla (kpc-2), bla (cmy-2), bla (tem-1), bla (ctx-m-14), and qnrb2 genes and belonged to sequence type st410, phylogenetic type a; the e2 isolate was assigned to st131-b2 and carried the bla (kpc-2), bla (tem-1), bla (ctx-m-3), bla (dha-1), aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnrs1 genes; while the e3 isolate was of st648-d and possessed bla (kpc-2), bla (tem-1), bla (oxa-1), bla (ctx-m-15), arma, and aac(6')-ib-cr genes. pfge demonstrated that each of the three kpc-2-producing e. coli isolates exhibited an individual xbai patterns. the bla (kpc-2) gene was located on plasmids of 60-140 kb with inca/c, incn, or non-typeable replicon types. the genetic environment of bla (kpc-2) of the three strains was consistent with the genetic structure of bla (kpc-2) on the plasmid pkp048.
genetics	next generation sequencing (ngs) is the emerging technology in forensic genomics laboratories. it offers higher resolution to address most problems of human identification, greater efficiency and potential ability to interrogate very challenging forensic casework samples. in this study, a trial set of dna samples was artificially degraded by progressive aqueous hydrolysis, and analyzed together with the corresponding unmodified dna sample and control sample 2800 m, to test the performance and reliability of the forenseq(tm) dna signature prep kit using the miseq sequencer (illumina). the results of replicate tests performed on the unmodified sample (1.0 ng) and on scalar dilutions (1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 ng) of the reference sample 2800 m showed the robustness and the reliability of the ngs approach even from sub-optimal amounts of high quality dna. the degraded samples showed a very limited number of reads/sample, from 2.9-10.2 folds lower than the ones reported for the less concentrated 2800 m dna dilution (0.1 ng). in addition, it was impossible to assign up to 78.2% of the genotypes in the degraded samples as the software identified the corresponding loci as low coverage (< 50x). amplification artifacts such as allelic imbalances, allele drop outs and a single allele drop in were also scored in the degraded samples. however, the forenseq(tm) dna sequencing kit, on the illumina miseq, was able to generate data which led to the correct typing of 5.1-44.8% and 10.9-58.7% of 58 of the strs and 92 snps, respectively. in all trial samples, the snp markers showed higher chances to be typed correctly compared to the strs. this ngs approach showed very promising results in terms of ability to recover genetic information from heavily degraded dna samples for which the conventional pcr/ce approach gave no results. the frequency of genetic mistyping was very low, reaching the value of 1.4% for only one of the degraded samples. however, these results suggest that further validation studies and a definition of interpretation criteria for ngs data are needed before implementation of this technique in forensic genetics.
internal_combustion_engine	concerns have been expressed regarding the displacement of harmful emissions from internal combustion engine vehicle (icev) tailpipes to the sources of electricity generation used to charge electric vehicles (ev). the degree to which evs can reduce the environmental impacts of road transportation is dependent on the fuel mix of electricity generation within a country and on the real-time charging behaviours of ev users since the fuel mix of electricity generation frequently changes. this paper analyses the varying environmental impacts of evs based on contrasting user behaviours and compares them to the environmental impacts of icevs. individual ev user profiles are developed which comprise real data emerging from charge events undertaken in ireland, and information is gathered on the actual co2 intensity of the electrical grid in real-time, allowing for the carbon intensity of every individual charge event to be determined using time and date information. the results show that the environmental impacts of evs are highly influenced by the charging behaviours of individual users, and night-time charging was found to produce the largest environmental impact. evs are shown to be a more environmentally friendly choice of vehicle than icevs under a wide majority of scenarios.

southern_blotting	background: facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd), a common autosomal dominant muscular disorder, is caused by contraction of the d4z4 repeats on 4q35. the complicated genotype-phenotype correlation among different ethnic population remains a controversial subject. we aimed to refine this correlation in order to provide new information for genetic counseling. methods: here, a cohort of 136 chinese families including 178 affected individuals and 137 unaffected members were investigated. genetic analyses were performed using the p13e-11, 4qa and 4qb probes after pulsed field gel electrophoresis separation and southern blotting. a 10-grade fshd clinical severity scale was adopted for clinical assessment. the genotype-phenotype correlation was established by linear regression analyses. results: we observed a roughly inversed correlation between the short ecori fragment size and age-corrected clinical severity score in 154 symptomatic patients (p < 0.05). compared to male patients, a significant higher proportion of females in both asymptomatic carriers and severe patients showed larger variation in the size of short ecori fragment. a high incidence (19/42, 45.2%) of asymptomatic (or minimally affected) carriers was found in familial members. conclusions: although the number of d4z4 repeats is known as one of the critical influences on genotype-phenotype correlation, a majority of phenotypic spectrum was still incompatible with their heterozygous contraction of the d4z4 repeat, especial in female cases. our results suggest that there are multi-factors synergistically modulating the phenotypic expression.
manufacturing_engineering	some of the activities of the project center for nanotechnology and advanced engineering (pc-nae) in manufacturing engineering are reported, focusing onto some recent trends and developments in advanced manufacturing of advanced materials, in the important engineering topics from industrial, research and academic point of view: nanotechnology/nanostructured materials, ultraprecision engineering, net shape manufacturing, mainly powder processing under shock loading and their applications in various fields of science and engineering e.g. machine tool industry, biomedicines, energy conservation and transport, namely automotive and aircraft industry, etc.
polymerase_chain_reaction	rna-sequencing of the patient 's bone marrow detected fusion transcripts in which the coding sequence of the fam53b gene (from 10q26) was fused to a genomic sequence (from 19q13) that mapped upstream of the slc7a10 locus. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction together with sanger sequencing verified the presence of this fusion transcript. the fam53b fusion transcript is not expected to produce any chimeric protein. however, it may code for a truncated fam53b protein consisting of the first 302 amino acids of fam53b together with amino acids from the 19q13 sequence. functionally, the truncated fam53b would be similar to the protein encoded by the fam53b sequence with accession no. bc031654.1 (fam53b protein accession no. aah31654.1). furthermore, the truncated protein contains the entire conserved domain of the fam53 protein family. the chromosome aberration t(10;19)(q26;q13) detected in this study was previously reported in a single case of all, in which it was also the sole karyotypic change. both patients entered complete hematological and cytogenetic remission following treatment.
human_metabolism	the consumption of fish and shellfish is a major route of human exposure to arsenic (as), because they contain relatively large concentrations of organoarsenicals, in particular arsenobetaine (ab). ab is considered non-toxic because of its rapid excretion from the human body. however, previous studies on human metabolism and excretion of ab have used the compound in solution rather than considering the effects that occur during the digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract. in this preliminary study, we used microcosms inoculated with human faecal matter to investigate the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of ab by microorganisms associated with the large intestine. samples were recovered over 30 days, centrifuged, filtered and the supernatant analysed for total as content and as speciation, using icp-ms and hplc-icp-ms respectively. after 7 days the total as in the supernatants from the aerobic experiment fell to a minimum of 65% of the total added, recovering to 15% less than added after 30 days. by using anion and cation exchange chromatography coupled to icp-ms detection, arsenobetaine (ab), dimethylarsinic acid (dma), dimethylarsinoylacetic acid (dmaa) and trimethylarsine oxide (tmao) were identified as degradation products. results from the aerobic system showed that after 7 days incubation the ab had been degraded to dma, dmaa and tmao and after 30 days the degraded ab reappeared in the samples. the results for the anaerobic system showed no degradation of ab over the 30 day course of the experiment. these findings demonstrate for the first time that biocatalytic capability for ab degradation exists within the human gastrointestinal tract.
computer-aided_design	a systematic method which combines the shape curvature entropy and computational fluid dynamics analyses was proposed in this study for creating automobile shapes. various automobile shapes were evaluated by the proposed method and the parameters including the curvature entropy and the drag coefficient of each configuration were calculated so as to determine the optimal shape design. first, shapes of commercially available car models were collected and their curvature entropy values were determined by the proposed equation. meanwhile, the drag coefficient of each car model was determined by computational fluid dynamics simulation. both values were compared and the results indicated a positive correlation between an automobile shape 's curvature entropy value and its drag coefficient. therefore, the curvature entropy is proven to be a suitable indicator for estimating an automobile shape 's aerodynamic performance. for a new automobile shape design, the required number of numerical analyses can be reduced by utilizing the proposed curvature entropy calculation so that the time spent on designing an automobile shape can be greatly reduced.
thermodynamics	we studied production of biodiesel from microalga chlorella protothecoides (sag 211-10 c) through direct saponification of its wet biomass (70% moisture) in a microwave reactor using ethanolic potassium hydroxide. the resulting soap was precipitated by ""common ion effect"" using saturated solution of potassium chloride and subjected to simultaneous acidulation and esterification to form biodiesel. the optimum parameters for saponification were: temperaure- 60 a degrees c, ethanol to dry biomass ratio (ml/g)-80 : 1, concentration of koh-0.5%, microwave power-450w; and for esterification they were temperature-60 a degrees c, wt% of sulfuric acid-2.5%, molar ratio of methanol to fatty acids-70 : 1, microwave power-450w. the kinetics and thermodynamics of saponification and esterification were investigated. both reactions were found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. activation energies were determined as 14.177 kj/mol and 17.234 kj/mol for saponification and esterification, respectively. the final biodiesel yield and purity were 98.74% and 94.83%, respectively.
cell_biology	phosphatidylethanolamine is one of the most abundant phospholipids whose major amounts are formed by phosphatidylserine decarboxylases (po). here we provide a comprehensive description of different types of psds in the different kingdoms of life. in eukaryotes, type i psds are mitochondrial enzymes, whereas other psds are localized to other cellular compartments. we describe the role of mitochondrial psd1 proteins, their function, enzymology, biogenesis, assembly into mitochondria and their contribution to phospholipid homeostasis in much detail. we also discuss briefly the cellular physiology and the enzymology of psd2. this article is part of a special issue entitled: lipids of mitochondria edited by guenther daum.

genetics	this study evaluates the utility of dna barcoding (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i; coi) as a biodiversity and conservation applied tool for identifying fish fauna from the southeastern mediterranean (the continental coast of israel), a hot-spot area for biological invasion, also with an eye to establish the foundation for follow-up studies that will use environmental dna (edna) tracks of native and invasive species, and for the application of edna concepts and methodologies in nature conservation. we established a dataset of 280 dna barcodes, representing 110 marine fish species (all identified by a taxonomist), belonging to 75 native and 35 lessepsian migratory species that were tested within and against the bold system database. most of the query sequences showed 98% matches with reference dna barcodes in the bold system excluding two trachurus species, three dasyatis pastinaca and two rhinobatos rhino batos individuals. relatively high intraspecific genetic distances were observed in two elasmobranchii species (8.83%-18%), suggesting possible cryptic species. in contrast, relatively low interspecific genetic distances were found between two actinopterygii species (1.54%). gobiidae family members were observed as being the most scattered on the bayesian tree. out of the 110 fish species, 48 were taxonomically discordant with the bold bins (4 at the family level, 15 at the genus level and 29 at the species level), 53 were concordant and 9 were singletons. discordancy was noted for some dip lodus and fistularia species during the bold bin analysis. apogon queketti, champsodon nudivittis and cheilodipterus novemstriatus were uploaded to the bold system for the first time. we elucidated 177 haplotypes, 122 for the native fish species and 55 for the lessepsian species. the results will allow the evaluation of invasive species success and will help developing improved policies for the conservation of mediterranean biodiversity.

molecular_biology	the present article reviews the biotechnological research in zingiber montanum (koenig) link ex a. dietr. (cassumunar ginger). studies on biotechnological interventions in this plant were focused mainly on the application of tissue culture techniques. recently, attentions are being drawn towards the genomic studies which mostly aimed at establishing the genetic relationship of different gene pools. the present review summarizes the various aspects of tissue culture protocol for in vitro micropropagation, in vitro microrhizome induction, in vitro conservation technology and molecular biology studies of this medicinal plant. this review will help in further research of this plant in areas related to tissue culture for propagation and increased production of important secondary metabolites, phylogenetic analysis and genetic engineering. moreover, it will offer an insight into crop improvement and breeding programs of this important underutilized medicinal plant for improved yield and quality of secondary metabolites.
thermodynamics	high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses are carried out to understand the microstructure of the ultra-thin oxide-film grown on a (native) amorphous al2o3-coated al-0.8 at.% mg alloy substrate at t = 600 k for t = 2 h and at po(2) of 1 x 10(-2) pa. this oxide-film is found to be non-uniformly thick with thicknesses varying from 1.50 to 4.60 nm. occasionally, this oxide is found to diffuse into the al-mg alloy substrate, forming oxide thicknesses up to 10.5 nm. overall, this oxide-film is found to consist of a mixed amorphous, (poly) crystalline and an intermediate amorphous-to-crystalline transition regions, with crystalline regions consisting mostly of mgo and the diffused oxide regions into the al-mg alloy substrate coated with gamma-al2o3. these observations are then compared with the experimental results obtained using angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and thermodynamic predictions for the growth of an ultra-thin oxide-film due to dry, thermal oxidation of al-mg alloy substrates.
materials_engineering	we report on an experimental verification that emission properties of photocathodes can be manipulated through the engineering of the surface electronic structure. ultrathin multilayered mgo/ag(0 0 1)/mgo films were grown by pulsed laser deposition, tuning the thickness n of the flanking mgo layers to 0, 2, 3, and 4 monolayers. we observed an increase in quantum efficiency and simultaneous decrease in work function with layer thickness. the scale and trend direction of measurements are in good but not excellent agreement with theory. angle resolved photoemission data for the multilayered sample n = 3 showed that the emission profile has a metallic-like momentum dispersion. deviations from theoretical predictions [k. nemeth et al., prl 104, 046801 (2010)] are attributed to imperfections of real surfaces in contrast with the ideal surfaces of the calculation. photoemissive properties of cathodes are critical for electron beam applications such as photoinjectors for free electron lasers (fel) and energy recovery linacs (erl). an ideal photoemitter has a high quantum efficiency, low work function, low intrinsic emittance and long lifetime. it has been demonstrated here that emission properties may be systematically tailored by control of layer thickness in ultrathin multilayered structures. the reproducibility of the emission parameters under specific growth conditions is excellent, even though the interfaces themselves have varying degrees of roughness.

northern_blotting	cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), the rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin (pg) biosynthesis, plays a key role in inflammation, tumorigenesis, development and circulatory homeostasis. cox-2 expression is rapidly and sensitively regulated by various stimuli, and also its regulation is distinct among cell types at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. therefore, it is important to consider these features of cox-2 expression in the reporter assays we describe in this chapter. emphasis should be made with regard to two points. firstly, cox-2 reporter assays should be evaluated by intrinsic cox-2 expression, such as rt-pcr, northern blotting, western blotting, or by pge(2) measurement. secondly, one must carefully choose several conditions in the reporter assays for experimental purposes.
genetics	hop with powdery mildew [hpm: caused by podosphaera macularis (wallr.) u. braun & s. takam.] results in significant losses in hop production by reducing yield and quality. one means of increasing yield and quality is the production of resistant hop lines. breeding for resistance can be significantly improved and accelerated by use of marker-assisted selection. the objective of this preliminary study was to identify qtls and markers for genetic resistance to hpm. a bi-parental mapping population between the resistant line ""newport'' and susceptible line '21110m'. phenotypic data was scored under controlled greenhouse conditions. significant differences among offspring were observed and disease resistance did not follow a distinct binomial distribution, suggesting quantitative genetic control. genotyping-by-sequencing resulted in approximately 375 k snp markers, which were filtered down to 2263 markers mapped to 10 linkage groups. interval mapping identified four qtls with one on linkage group 1 and three located on linkage group 6. composite interval mapping identified three qtls, all located on linkage group 6. mixed linear models identified 15 markers associated with expression of resistance to hpm. three of these 15 snps were also identified in qtl-cim analysis. evaluation of the scaffolds containing the significant snp markers identified seven putative genes-several of which appear involved in disease resistance in other plant species. the snp markers identified in this study still require validation in unrelated populations prior to implementation in breeding programs.
immunology	inflammation is a local response to infection and tissue damage mediated by activated macrophages, monocytes, and other immune cells that release cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. for a long time, humoral and cellular mechanisms have been studied for their role in regulating the immune response, but recent advances in the field of immunology and neuroscience have also unraveled specific neural mechanisms with interesting therapeutic potential. the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (cap) has been described to control innate immune responses and inflammation in a very potent manner. in the early 2000s, tracey and collaborators developed a technique that stimulates the vagus nerve and mimics the effect of the pathway. the methodology is based on the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at low voltage and frequency, in order to avoid any side effects of overstimulation, such as deregulation of heart rate variability. electrical devices for stimulation are now available, making it easy to set up the methodology in the laboratory. the goal of this research was to investigate the potential involvement of prostaglandins in the cap. unfortunately, based on earlier attempts, we failed to use the original protocol, as the induced inflammatory response either was too high or was not suitable for enzymatic metabolism properties. the different settings of the original surgery protocol remained mostly unchanged, but the conditions regarding inflammatory induction and the time point before sacrifice were improved to fit our purposes (i. e., to investigate the involvement of the cap in more limited inflammatory responses). the modified version of the original protocol, presented here, includes a longer time range between vagus nerve stimulation and analysis, which is associated with a lower induction of inflammatory responses. additionally, while decreasing the level of lipopolysaccharides (lps) to inject, we also came across new observations regarding mechanistic properties in the spleen.
fluid_mechanics	dispersed micro- to nano-particle-laden gas flows are common in many engineering and environmental applications. characterizing both their dispersed and carrier phase using experimental methods is very important for determining their properties and behavior. this paper reviews techniques for measuring the carrier phase, as well as the dispersed particles ranging from the micro- to the nano-scale. we focus not only on the developments of specific techniques over the last 20 years, but also on relationships and comparisons among these techniques. in addition to a systematic description and classification of these methods, we discuss the parameters they measure, such as particle velocity, size, composition and concentration. a more detailed review is provided for several important measurement techniques, including particle image velocimetry, the phase-doppler particle analyzer and light-scattering intensity measurements for microparticles, as well as the scanning mobility particle sizer, the fast mobility particle sizer and the electrical low pressure impactor for nano-particles. the founding principles, development histories, various applications of these techniques and where they are going are summarized. this article provides a resource for investigators that plan to study micro- or nano-particle-laden gas flows in various contexts.
southern_blotting	originally prenatal diagnosis was confined to the diagnosis of metabolic disorders and depended on assaying enzyme levels in amniotic fluid. with the development of recombinant dna technology. molecular diagnosis became possible for some genetic conditions late in the 1970s. here we briefly review the history of molecular prenatal diagnostic testing, using duchenne muscular dystrophy as an example, and describe how over the last 30 years we have moved from offering testing to a few affected individuals using techniques. such as southern blotting to identify deletions, to more rapid and accurate pcr-based testing which identities the precise change in dystrophin for a greater number of families. we discuss the potential for safer, earlier prenatal genetic diagnosis using cell free fetal dna in maternal blood before concluding by speculating on how more recent techniques, such as next generation sequencing. might further impact on the potential for molecular prenatal testing. progress is not without its challenges, and as cytogenetics and molecular genetics begin to unite into one, we foresee the main challenge will not be in identifying the genetic change, but rather in interpreting its significance. particularly in the prenatal setting where we frequently have no phenotype on which to base interpretation. copyright (c) 2010 john wiley & sons. ltd.
thermodynamics	single and multi-component adsorptive removal of cs-134(+), co-60(2+) and eu-152+154(3+) from aqueous solutions onto sepiolite are studied in the present study. removal of these radionuclides in single systems is found to be strongly dependent on the initial ph on the solution. removals >99% (for(60)co(2+) and 152+154eu3+) and of about 82% (for cs-134(+)).are achieved at initial ph values higher than 4 and 5, respectively. the kinetic data and the equilibrium isotherms are modeled by two kinetic models, the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order, and two isotherm models, langmuir and freundlich, respectively. the effect of various coexisting cations, na+, ca2+ and al3+, at different concentrations on the adsorption processes of the concerned radionuclides in single systems was evaluated. desorption studies of radionuclide-loaded sepiolite are studied using different concentrations of organic, edta and ha (strong complexing agents for radionuclides), and inorganic, hci, naci, cacl2, mg(no3)(2) and alcl3, desorbing agents. adsorption mechanisms of radionuclides onto sepiolite are deeply discussed. multi-component adsorptive removal of cs-134(+), co-60(2+) and eu-152+154(3+) onto sepiolite as a function of adsorbent weight and time was also studied. the influence of the solution ph on co-removal efficiency of radionuclides was investigated in presence of edta. furthermore, the present investigation evaluated the removal efficiency of radionuclides, in multi-systems, in presence of different concentrations either of naci or cacl2.

polymerase_chain_reaction	this study aimed to evaluate the recovery of structurally intact human norovirus (nov) during kimchi fermentation at varying temperatures. lactic acid bacteria (lab), ph, and acidity during storage and fermentation were also measured to assess the correlation between nov reduction and microbial or physicochemical property alterations. lab number, nov g titer, ph, acidity, and the ability of nov gii.4 to persist in kimchi stored at 4 degrees c and 10 degrees c (survivability) as determined using nano magnetic beads conjugated with poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride) combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification were investigated up to 28 days post inoculation. nov was detected in all test samples after 28 days although the nov recovery quantity was reduced to 1.31 (4 degrees c) and 1.66 (10 degrees c ) login genomic copies/reaction. the time required to reduce the amount of virus by 2.57 logic, (t(d)) on survival plots of nov determined using a modified weibull model was 2445 days at 4 degrees c and 138 days at 10 degrees c. these results indicate that nov from food preparation or processing is able to persistently survive in kimchi. therefore, preventing nov transmission is important for protecting kimchi against nov contamination.

manufacturing_engineering	to take up the challenge of global distributed companies, manufacturing engineering has to be accomplished in a worldwide collaborative way. design and development of production processes and their execution are nowadays spread all over the world. to ensure quality standards and to create synergies between spatially distributed entities, distance collaboration tools must be provided to allow cooperation even over large distances. the virtual reality (vr) is thereby offering beneficial capabilities to exchange current planning stages, identify problems and solve them cooperatively. this paper introduces a new approach for distance collaboration, which enables users to work in a joint virtual space, nearly as if they were working together in the same place. therefore two full-immersive cave-like systems are interconnected using the virca (virtual collaboration arena) platform. the paper describes the requirements of mechanical engineers towards distance collaboration tools and the technical challenges solved with the enhanced virca framework. this working prototype is one premier application in the field of vr-enhanced spatially distributed collaboration. a typical use case scenario is provided to highlight the interaction and cooperation capabilities offered by virca net.
southern_blotting	among microsporidia, nosema bombycis has a novel arrangement of lsurrna, ssurrna, its, igs and 5srrna. to determine the distribution of rdna among the chromosomes, we performed genome-wide screening and southern blotting with three probes (ssu, its and igs). southern blotting revealed that ribosomal rna genes are distributed on all chromosomes of n. bombycis, which is contrary to the previous result, which concluded that the n. bombycis rrna genes were limited to a single chromosome. this wide distribution is similar to that of the rdna unit of encephalitozoon cuniculi. screening of the n. bombycis genome detected 53 lsurrna elements, 43 ssurrna elements and 36 5srrna elements. however, it is still difficult to determine their loci on the chromosomes as the genomic map is unfinished.

machine_design	the objective of this paper is to develop an analytical optimal design tool to determine a megawatt-scale yokelss and segmented armature (yasa) machine design that fulfills the application requirements and constraints. this analytical tool considers both electromagnetic and structural designs. different designs that provide similar performance will have emerged from this analytical process. a design reference map that graphically shows the relationships and tradeoffs between each objective function is introduced. a multicriteria optimization process is applied to determine a design optimum. in the optimization process, the design objectives considered in this study are to minimize the outer diameter, to minimize the structural mass of the machine, to minimize the copper and iron losses, and to minimize the active materials cost. three variables considered in calculating the objective functions are the air-gap flux density, the ratio of outer-to-inner machine diameter, and the current loading. the optimization method uses a pseudoweight vector to provide the flexibility to prioritize one or more objective functions, dependant on the specific application requirements.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the human leukocyte antigen (hla) system plays critical roles in regulating immune responses to various vaccines. this study aimed to evaluate the association of hla class ii gene polymorphisms and the long-term duration of anti-hbs response in children vaccinated against hepatitis b during infancy. methods: totally 297 children 5-7 years after the completion of primary vaccination against hepatitis b in infancy, without booster immunization or natural resolved infection, were enrolled. of them, 86 children with anti-hbs= 10 miu/ml were defined as long-term responders. ten alleles in hla-dr and -dq subregions were detected by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. results: the frequency of hla-dqb1*0401 was 15.1% in the long-term non- or hypo-responder group, relatively higher than 7.6% in the long-term responder group (or = 2.17, 95% ci 1.01-4.73), however, the difference had no statistical significance after bonferroni correction (p = 0.470). the frequencies of seven hla-drb1 alleles, including (*)01, (*)03, (*)04, (*)07, (*)08, (*)11, and (*)1301/1302, and two hla-dqb1 alleles, including (*)0201 and (*)0501, were each similarly distributed in the long-term non- or hypo responders and responders respectively. conclusion: none of the ten hla class ii gene alleles previously reported to be related with short-term antibody response to hepatitis b vaccine is associated with the long-term antibody response after vaccination during infantile.

enzymology	melanoma is an aggressive tumor that expresses the pigmentation enzyme tyrosinase. tyrosinase expression increases during tumorigenesis, which could allow for selective treatment of this tumor type by strategies that use tyrosinase activity. approaches targeting tyrosinase would involve gene transcription or signal transduction pathways mediated by p53 in a direct or indirect manner. two pathways are proposed for exploiting tyrosinase expression: (a) a p53-dependent pathway leading to apoptosis or arrest and (b) a reactive oxygen species-mediated induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in p53 mutant tumors. both strategies could use tyrosinase-mediated activation of quercetin, a dietary polyphenol that induces the expression of p53 and modulates reactive oxygen species. in addition to antitumor signaling properties, activation of quercetin could complement conventional cancer therapy by the induction of phase ii detoxification enzymes resulting in p53 stabilization and transduction of its downstream targets. in conclusion, recent advances in tyrosinase enzymology, prodrug chemistry, and modern chemotherapeutics present an intriguing and selective multitherapy targeting system where dietary bioflavonoids could be used to complement conventional cancer treatments.

cell_biology	natural killer (nk) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are known for their ability to kill transformed and virus-infected cells. nk cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, and studies on mouse models have revealed that nk cell development is a complex, yet tightly regulated process, which is dependent on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. the development of nk cells can be broadly categorized into two phases: lineage commitment and maturation. efforts to better define the developmental framework of nk cells have led to the identification of several murine nk progenitor populations and mature nk cell subsets, each defined by a varied set of cell surface markers. nevertheless, the relationship between some of these nk cell subsets remains to be determined. the classical approach to studying both nk cell development and function is to identify the transcription factors involved and elucidate the mechanistic action of each transcription factor. in this regard, recent studies have provided further insight into the mechanisms by which transcription factors, such as id2, foxo1, kruppel-like factor 2, and gata-binding protein 3 regulate various aspects of nk cell biology. it is also becoming evident that the biology of nk cells is not only transcriptionally regulated but also determined by epigenetic alterations and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by micrornas. this review summarizes recent progress made in nk development, focusing primarily on transcriptional regulators and their mechanistic actions.
enzymology	botryococcene biosynthesis is thought to resemble that of squalene, a metabolite essential for sterol metabolism in all eukaryotes. squalene arises from an initial condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (fpp) to form presqualene diphosphate (pspp), which then undergoes a reductive rearrangement to form squalene. in principle, botryococcene could arise from an alternative rearrangement of the presqualene intermediate. because of these proposed similarities, we predicted that a botryococcene synthase would resemble squalene synthase and hence isolated squalene synthase-like genes from botryococcus braunii race b. while b. braunii does harbor at least one typical squalene synthase, none of the other three squalene synthase-like (ssl) genes encodes for botryococcene biosynthesis directly. ssl-1 catalyzes the biosynthesis of pspp and ssl-2 the biosynthesis of bisfarnesyl ether, while ssl-3 does not appear able to directly utilize fpp as a substrate. however, when combinations of the synthase-like enzymes were mixed together, in vivo and in vitro, robust botryococcene (ssl-1+ssl-3) or squalene biosynthesis (ssl1+ssl-2) was observed. these findings were unexpected because squalene synthase, an ancient and likely progenitor to the other botryococcus triterpene synthases, catalyzes a two-step reaction within a single enzyme unit without intermediate release, yet in b. braunii, these activities appear to have separated and evolved interdependently for specialized triterpene oil production greater than 500 mya. coexpression of the ssl-1 and ssl-3 genes in different configurations, as independent genes, as gene fusions, or targeted to intracellular membranes, also demonstrate the potential for engineering even greater efficiencies of botryococcene biosynthesis.
molecular_biology	aim: to review the literature on the oral health status of the population, evidence-based understanding of epigenetic mechanisms, and its significant role in diseases occurring in the oral cavity. background: epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that does not involve changes to the underlying dna sequence. in other words, it is a change in phenotype without a change in genotype, which in turn affects the way cells read genes. epigenetic change is a regular and natural occurrence but can also be influenced by several factors including age, the environment/lifestyle, and disease state. the field of epigenetics is quickly growing, and it is believed that both the environment and lifestyle can interact with the genome to influence epigenetic change. these changes may be reflected at various stages throughout a person 's life and even in later generations. conclusion: epigenetic codes help us understand the biological phenotype that arises from the interaction of the human genome with the environment in health and in disease. epigenetics is a major turn away from molecular biology. current epigenetics not only offers new insights into gene regulation and heredity, but also it challenges the way we think about evolution, genetics, and development. most interestingly, it suggests testable mechanisms whereby environmental factors (ranging from stress to infection) can influence genetic expression.
thermodynamics	in this study, citric acid (ca) was employed as a low-molecule organic acid to influence the adsorption performance of phosphorus by as-obtained magnetite. the factors including initial phosphate concentrations, dosage of citric acid, ph value, ion strength, contact time and temperature were examined in detail. results indicated that the dissolution of anion sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) covering on surface of magnetite, a slight decrease of fe level and a superior structure of magnetite after ca modification occurred. the ph-dependence of phosphate adsorption was impeded and the surface potential of magnetite positively increased at ph >5.0 when ca was added. non-linear regression langmuir-freundlich model was fitted well in thermodynamics, and the opposite adsorption process as a function of temperatures with or without ca addition was due to the decrease of active energy and active mobility of phosphate ion. finally, the declining adsorption efficiency with increasing cycles was observed while phosphate removal was approximately finished and had small change with 0.05 and 0.1 m of ca addition. those improvements of removal efficiency of phosphorus by modified iron oxide were because of the removal of anionic sds that increased the surface positive charge, and especially the dissolution of element fe into solution to form precipitate with phosphorus ions. the enhanced stability of magnetite by ca also promoted the high removal efficiency of phosphorus. these implications of ca on phosphate removal can be extended to the field where phosphate pollution is notorious but urgent.

enzymology	nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (naprt, ec 2.4.2.11) catalyzes the conversion of nicotinate (na) to nicotinate mononucleotide, the first reaction of the preiss-handler pathway for the biosynthesis of nad(+). even though naprt activity has been described to be responsible for the ability of na to increase nad(+) levels in human cells more effectively than nicotinamide (nam), so far a limited number of studies on the human naprt have appeared. here, extensive characterization of a recombinant human naprt is reported. we determined its major kinetic parameters and assayed the influence of different compounds on its enzymatic activity. in particular, atp showed an apparent dual stimulation/inhibition effect at low/high substrates saturation, respectively, consistent with a negative cooperativity model, whereas inorganic phosphate was found to act as an activator. among other metabolites assayed, including nucleotides, nucleosides, and intermediates of carbohydrates metabolism, some showed inhibitory properties, i.e. coa, several acyl-coas, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, whereas dihydroxyacetone phosphate and pyruvate exerted a stimulatory effect. furthermore, in light of the absence of crystallographic data, we performed homology modeling to predict the protein three-dimensional structure, and molecular docking simulations to identify residues involved in the recognition and stabilization of several ligands. most of these residues resulted universally conserved among naprts, and, in this study, their importance for enzyme activity was validated through site-directed mutagenesis.

molecular_biology	the aim of this study was to compare the data obtained using the new liaison (r) xl chemiluminescence system to search for hbsag, antihcv, and anti-hiv1-2/p24 ag with those obtained using the vitros system currently adopted by the microbiology unit of the hospital of legnano. routine samples of patients who were referred by practitioners for the determination of hbsag (1,000 samples) and/or anti-hcv (1,002 samples) and/or anti-hiv1-2 (995 samples) were simultaneously analyzed using both systems. the concordant positive and discordant samples were re-examined for confirmation by means of an hbsag neutralization assay, anti-hcv immunoblot, or anti-hiv1-2 western blot; hbv-dna, or hcv-rna or hiv-rna was also sought in the discordant samples. samples of patients known to be positive were tested (100 hbsag positive, 100 anti-hcv positive, and 100 hiv 1-2 positive) as well throughout treatment, with viremia levels becoming undetectable after treatment. the hbsag, anti-hcv, and anti-hiv1-2 concordance between the two systems in routine series was respectively 99.8%, 98.5% and 99.7%, and 100% for all markers in samples known positive. the various molecular biology and confirmatory tests of the discordant samples were all negative (except for one anti-hcv positive sample). measure of cohen 's kappa coefficient for hbsag, anti-hcv, and anti-hiv gave k values of respectively 0.992, 0.946, and 0.980. in conclusion, the performance of the liaison (r) xl system in the routine laboratory determination for all three markers was comparable with that of the vitros system.

computer-aided_design	this paper presents a 3-d statistical simulation study of an n-channel si step-finfet due to work-function variability depending on grain orientation of metal gate. the statistical fluctuation induced by metal gate granularity on threshold-voltage (sigma v-t), on current (sigma i-on), and off current (sigma i-off) are estimated for a wide range of channel length and effective fin width for varying average grain size using technology computer aided design simulator. we investigated the effect of grain on magnitude of variability and also on shapes of various electrical parameters of distribution. the results indicate that sigma v-t decreases for increase in each dimension of the device. the value of sigma(ion), and sigma(ioff) reduces as channel length increases. however, sigma(ion) and sigma(ioff) increase as fin width increases. the distribution of electrical parameters is near to normal for small grain size and becomes bimodal at large grain size. the proposed structure shows excellent behavior in terms of threshold-voltage (v-t), subthreshold swing, and current ratio (i-on/i-off) compared with conventional finfet at high temperature. it is found that the hot carrier effect reduces with increased effective channel width.
southern_blotting	flavobacterium columnare, the etiological agent of columnaris disease, is one of the most important and widespread bacterial pathogens of freshwater fish. in this study, we constructed two artificial selectable markers (chloramphenicol and spectinomycin resistance) for gene transfer in f. columnare. these two new artificial selectable markers, which were created by placing the chloramphenicol or spectinomycin resistance gene under the control of the native acs regulatory region of f. columnare, were functional in both f. columnare and escherichia coli. the integrative/conjugative plasmids constructed by using these markers were introduced into f. columnare g(4) via electroporation or conjugation. the integrated plasmid dna was confirmed by southern blotting and pcr analysis. these two markers can be employed in future investigations into gene deletion and the pathogenicity of virulence factors in f. columnare.
strength_of_materials	polished finishing granites are greatly accepted for claddings because of the plates' shape, design and color variety. the features depend on the geological conditions that occur during the formation process, which include the mineralogy of the stone, the fluids formed during the process, the grain size of the minerals and the way in which the minerals interact with each other. one of the noblest uses of stone plates is in non-adherent covering systems (without mortar), such as ventilated fa double dagger ades and pedestrian paving systems. currently, the methodology for non-adherent systems uses the allowable stress design criteria. in recent years, the number of papers indicating reliability analysis as an important design tool for natural stones has increased. however, a lack of information concerning the design methodology still happens. therefore, the structural properties assessed as complementing these studies were: compressive strength, three-point flexural tensile strength, young 's modulus and poisson 's ratio. a granite slab design example was also presented. first, the thickness of the plates was determined based on the formulation proposed by timoshenko [strength of materials (original language, portuguese), volume ii. editora ao livro t,cnico s. a., rio de janeiro, 1977], using the allowable stress design criteria. next, the reliability analysis was performed by monte carlo simulation. results showed that the desire, white granitic plate presented a higher reliability index than the capo bonito red granitic plate. this result seems to be paradoxical, owing that the capo bonito red presented a higher value of mean flexural strength than the desire, white. the minimal safety factors to satisfy the target reliability value of 3.8 as recommended by the standard en 1990:2002 (eurocode) were found to be 2.61, 1.98 and 2.72, respectively, for the three stone types.
fluid_mechanics	we present a preliminary examination of a new approach to a long-standing problem in non-newtonian fluid mechanics. first, we summarize how a general implicit functional relation between stress and rate of strain of a continuum with memory is reduced to the well-known linear differential constitutive relations that account for ""relaxation"" and ""retardation."" then, we show that relaxation and retardation are asymptotically equivalent for small deborah numbers, whence causal pure relaxation models necessarily correspond to ill-posed pure retardation models. we suggest that this dichotomy could be a possible way to reconcile the discrepancy between the theory of and certain experiments on viscoelastic liquids that are conjectured to exhibit only stress retardation.

molecular_biology	background: the immunoprecipitation (ip) assay is a valuable molecular biology tool applied across a breadth of fields. the standard assay couples ip to immunoblotting (ip/ib), a procedure severely limited as it is not easily scaled for high-throughput analysis. results: here we describe and characterize a new methodology for fast and reliable evaluation of an immunoprecipitation reaction. flip (fluorescence ip) relies on the expression of the target protein as a chromophore-tagged protein and couples ip with the measurement of fluorescent signal coating agarose beads. we show here that flip displays similar sensitivity to the standard ip/ib procedure but is amenable to high-throughput analysis. we applied flip to the screening of mouse monoclonal antibodies of unknown behavior in ip procedures. the parallel analysis of the considered antibodies using flip and ip/western shows good correlation between the two procedures. we also show application of flip using unpurified antibodies (hybridoma supernatant) and we developed a publicly available tool for the easy analysis and quantification of flip signals. conclusions: altogether, our characterizations of this new methodology show that flip is an appealing and reliable tool for any application of high-throughput ip.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the present study investigated ubiquitin specific peptidase 39 (usp39) gene knockdown on smmc-7721 cells in vitro and in vivo, and the role of usp39 in regulating the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). two small interfering rnas (sirna) were constructed, which targeted the usp39 gene and control sequences were synthesized and inserted into a pgcsil-gfp lentiviral vector. the full length of usp39 cdna was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and cloned into pegfp-n2, and the recombinant plasmids were transfected into cells. knockdown efficiency and upregulation of usp39 was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and western blotting. the impact of usp39 on the growth of smmc-7721 cells in vitro was examined using an mtt assay, colony formation, flow cytometry (fcm) and immunohistochemical staining. the impact of usp39 on the growth of smmc-7721 cells in vivo was examined by assessing tumorigenicity in nude mice. western blotting was performed to examine the mechanism of usp39 regulation on smmc-7721 cell growth. recombinant vectors containing specific and scrambled usp39 sirna sequences were constructed and transfected into smmc-7721 cells. usp39 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in smmc-7721 cells, while upregulation of usp39 promoted the growth of tumor cells. fcm indicated that usp39 knockdown led to g2/m arrest and induced apoptosis in smmc-7721 cells. usp39 knockdown inhibited xenograft tumor growth in nude mice and led to the downregulation of the transcription factor forkhead box m1 (foxm1). gene expression of foxm1 targets, including polo-like kinase 1, cyclin b1 and centromere protein a also decreased following usp39 knockdown. the results suggest that knockdown of usp39 inhibits the growth of hcc in vitro and in vivo, potentially through the induction of g2/m arrest by regulating the pre-mrna splicing of foxm1.
materials_engineering	recent advances in the simulation of the quench, cold-work and machining processes for large aluminum forgings are opening the way for a new paradigm in the design, manufacture and sustainment of aircraft structures. the use of large forgings permits the unitization of smaller parts (brackets, fittings, lugs, etc.) with primary structural components like spars and bulkheads. this is being done in order to reduce part count, which in turn leads to significant reductions in manufacturing cost. unitization can also translate into weight reduction / avoidance when comparing against built-up structure, but it raises a number of issues for structural durability and damage tolerance, notably reduced repair / replace capability and reduced crack arrest capability. the viability of the unitization concept is dependent not only on the availability of material systems that retain their mechanical properties in very thick sections, but also on the designer 's ability to retain durability and damage tolerance, and to understand and mitigate the effects of residual stresses. recently a ""next-generation"" design approach that directly addresses some of these issues has been developed and deployed. among other things, this new approach requires the extraction of residual stress effects from material property data and the explicit re-introduction of those effects in selected, critical regions of the structure. in this paper we will provide an overview of an emerging application of icme to the design of large aluminum forgings for aircraft primary structure and the concomitant development of verification and validation methodologies.
immunology	rabbit is the third most commonly used animal model in different fields of scientific research, such as reproductive biology, fertility and embryo transfer studies, and immunology. this animal species, often used in antibodies production, has minority of scientific records about the immunological status of its reproductive organs. the aim of this study was to find histological and immunological changes in rabbit female reproductive tract during different reproductive stages. the study was carried out on female rabbits, divided in three groups, according to the following stages of reproductive cycle: estrous, ovulation and pregnancy. histological and immunohistochemical stains for t- and b-cells were performed on tissue samples of cornu uteri and cervix. t lymphocytes were predominant in all anatomical parts of the uterus, in all stages of the cycle. the highest number of those cells was recorded at estrous, while the lowest was recorded at pregnancy. cervix expressed more immunological activity than cornu uteri. the distribution and the number of immune positive cells in the rabbit female reproductive tract depend on its hormonal status.
cell_biology	prostate cancer is known to frequently recur in bone; however, how dormant cells switch its phenotype leading to recurrent tumor remains poorly understood. we have isolated two syngeneic cell lines (indolent and aggressive) through in vivo selection by implanting pc3mm stem-like cells into tibial bones. we found that indolent cells retained the dormant phenotype, whereas aggressive cells grew rapidly in bone in vivo, and the growth rates of both cells in culture were similar, suggesting a role of the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of dormancy and recurrence. indolent cells were found to secrete a high level of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (sparc), which significantly stimulated the expression of bmp7 in bone marrow stromal cells. the secreted bmp7 then kept cancer cells in a dormant state by inducing senescence, reducing stemness, and activating dormancy-associated p38 mapk signaling and p21 expression in cancer cells. importantly, we found that sparc was epigenetically silenced in aggressive cells by promoter methylation, but 5-azacytidine treatment reactivated the expression. furthermore, high sparc promoter methylation negatively correlated with disease-free survival of prostate cancer patients. we also found that the cox2 inhibitor ns398 down-regulated dnmts and increased expression of sparc, which led to tumor growth suppression in bone in vivo. these findings suggest that sparc plays a key role in maintaining the dormancy of prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.
enzymology	bioligninolysis involves living organisms and/or their products in degradation of lignin, which is highly resistant, plant-originated polymer having three-dimensional network of dimethoxylated (syringyl), monomethoxylated (guaiacyl), and non-methoxylated (p-hydroxyphenyl) phenylpropanoid and acetylated units. as a major repository of aromatic chemical structures on earth, lignin bears paramount significance for its removal owing to potential application of bioligninolytic systems in industrial production. early reports illustrating the discovery and cloning of ligninolytic biocatalysts in fungi was truly a landmark in the field of enzymatic delignification. however, the enzymology for bacterial delignification is hitherto poorly understood. moreover, the lignin-degrading bacterial genes are still unknown and need further exploration. this review deals with the current knowledge about ligninolytic enzyme families produced by fungi and bacteria, their mechanisms of action, and genetic regulation and reservations, which render them attractive candidates in biotechnological applications.
northern_blotting	porcine cfl2b gene play an important role in the muscle development and myofibrillar formation in pig. to explore whether cfl2b expression affects muscle fiber trait, the porcine cfl2b full-length cdna was amplified using homology based cdna cloning and smart race. then the full length cdna of porcine cfl2b was inserted into pegfp-n1 and transfected into c2c12 cells. the cells stably expressing cfl2b were selected by g418. we examined the expression of myhc 2x, myhc 2b and myhc1/slow in c2c12 cells stably expressing cfl2b. the results showed that the level of myhc 2x and myhc 2b mrna were dramatically increased compared with control cells, while the level of myhc1/slow mrna is not changed. to identify the transcription events of cfl2b, the porcine cfl2b mrna was detected by northern blotting, two transcripts, long transcript (3,012 bp) and short transcript (1,466 bp) were found in porcine skeletal muscles. the nucleotide sequence of cfl2b shares 88.1 and 74.9% homology with the cfl2b gene in human and mouse. the deduced amino acid sequence of cfl2b (166 amino acids) in pig shares 100, 99.1% identity with the cfl2b in human and mouse, respectively. taken together, our research revealed that porcine cfl2b may be involved in the regulation muscle fiber trait by affecting the expression of myhc.
internal_combustion_engine	the effect of urea injection on nox emissions in a six-cylinder, four-stroke internal combustion engine fueled with b80 biodiesel has been experimentally investigated. the results reveal that urea injection leads to a reduction of nox emissions of b80 biodiesel fuel. moreover, the influence of injection parameters on nox reductions has been studied. the findings show that increasing the injection temperature results in lower nox emissions. also urea mass flow rate increment leads to more nox reduction. the same result has been obtained by an increase in spray angle. in addition, increasing the number of nozzles indicates more depletion in nox emissions while a ""three-nozzles spray system"" has the most considerable effect on nox reductions.

enzymology	in eukaryotes, oxidized pufas, so-called oxylipins, are vital signaling molecules. the first step in their biosynthesis may be catalyzed by a lipoxygenase (lox), which forms hydroperoxides by introducing dioxygen into pufas. here we characterized csplox1, a phylogenetically distant lox family member from cyanothece sp. pcc 8801 and determined its crystal structure. in addition to the classical two domains found in plant, animal, and coral loxs, we identified an n-terminal helical extension, reminiscent of the long alpha-helical insertion in pseudomonas aeruginosa lox. in liposome flotation studies, this helical extension, rather than the beta-barrel domain, was crucial for a membrane binding function. additionally, csplox1 could oxygenate 1,2-diarachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, suggesting that the enzyme may act directly on membranes and that fatty acids bind to the active site in a tail-first orientation. this binding mode is further supported by the fact that csplox1 catalyzed oxygenation at the n-10 position of both linoleic and arachidonic acid, resulting in 9r- and 11r-hydroperoxides, respectively. together these results reveal unifying structural features of loxs and their function. while the core of the active site is important for lipoxygenation and thus highly conserved, peripheral domains functioning in membrane and substrate binding are more variable.
polymerase_chain_reaction	several simian adenoviruses (advs) have been detected and isolated in various species of non-human primates with the goals of monitoring the health of wildlife and investigating their potential for zoonotic disease transmission. here, we provide evidence of adv infection in wild assamese macaques (macaca assamensis assamensis) at phu khieo wildlife sanctuary, thailand, based on polymerase chain reaction of non-invasively collected fecal samples. eight out of 110 fecal samples (7.3%), or five out of 87 monkeys (5.7%), showed evidence of adv infection. all infected individuals were infants or juveniles. phylogenetic analysis based on the sequence of hexon and polymerase genes revealed two different adv genotypes. one genotype clustered in the human adv-g group, while another showed 100% identity with previously reported advs of captive chinese rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta), which may be tentatively classified as a new species of adv in non-human primates while awaiting further supporting evidence.
internal_combustion_engine	the demand for clean power source which can be used to run the various types of vehicles on the road is increasing on a daily basis due to the fact that high emissions released from internal combustion engine play a significant role in air pollution and climate change. fuel cell devices, particularly proton exchange membrane (pem) type, are strong candidates to replace the internal combustion engines in the transport industry. the pemfc technology still has many challenges including high cost, low durability and hydrogen storage problems which limit the wide-world commercialization of this technology. in this paper, the fuel cell cost, durability and performances challenges which are associated with using of fuel cell technology for transport applications are detailed and reviewed. recent developments that deal with the proposed challenges are reported. furthermore, problems of hydrogen infrastructure and hydrogen storage in the fuel cell vehicle are discussed.

molecular_biology	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv), which is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea in china and other countries, is responsible for serious economic losses in the pork industry. inactivated pedv vaccine plays a key role in controlling the prevalence of pedv. however, consistently low viral titers are obtained during the propagation of pedv in vitro; this represents a challenge to molecular analyses of the virus and vaccine development. in this study, we successfully isolated a pedv isolate (strain nj) from clinical samples collected during a recent outbreak of diarrhea in piglets in china, using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (iec). we found that the isolate was better adapted to growth in iecs than in vero cells, and the titer of the iec cultures was 10(4.5) tcid50/0.1 ml at passage 45. mutations in the s protein increased with the viral passage and the mutations tended towards attenuation. viral challenge showed that the survival of iec-adapted cultures was higher at the 45th passage than at the 5th passage. the use of iecs to isolate and propagate pedv provides an effective approach for laboratory-based diagnosis of pedv, as well as studies of the epidemiological characteristics and molecular biology of this virus.
strength_of_materials	use type 4a nanoscale zeolite powder composite with low-density polyethylene(ldpe), obtained the different of doping concentration of composite materials which the zeolite weight percentage are from 0.5wt% to 3wt%. by using broadband dielectric spectrometer measure and analyse the dielectric performance in a relatively wide frequency range to lopeizeolite composite and pure polyethylene at different temperature (293k, 323k and 353k). the test results show that, with the increase of the concentration of the doping, the lope/zeolite composite materials' dielectric constant gradually declined, until below 2.0 when the zeolite weight percentage was 3wt% at 293k. because zeolite material has a framework of silicon, oxygen and aluminum with porous structure, the empty space in the framework make the dielectric constant of lopeizeolite composite reduced. when the temperature rise to 323k and 353k the dielectric constant of lopeizeolite composite and pure polyethylene are on a declining curve. the dielectric constant goes to 1.85 when the zeolite weight percentage was 3wt% at 353k and the frequency is 106hz. at the same time, dielectric losses of the composite material also have obvious changes, in the low frequency area dielectric loss of lope/zeolite composite decrease in 10(-2)similar to 1hz area and are lower the pure polyethylene. in the 10(1) similar to 10(4)hz area, the dielectric losses of lope/zeolite composite have a peak in all the samples. when the frequency is more than 10(5)hz, the dielectric losses are on the rise. this kind of phenomenon can be also concerned with the framework of zeolite within the lope/zeolite composite. this new type of composite material keeps the same performance of polyethylene, reduce the dielectric constant and change the dielectric loss features will contribute to improve the breakdown strength of materials.
fluid_mechanics	cardiovascular diseases (cvds) are the leading cause of death in the western world. with the current development of clinical diagnostics to more accurately measure the extent and specifics of cvds, a laudable goal is a better understanding of the structure-function relation in the cardiovascular system. much of this fundamental understanding comes from the development and study of models that integrate biology, medicine, imaging, and biomechanics. information from these models provides guidance for developing diagnostics, and implementation of these diagnostics to the clinical setting, in turn, provides data for refining the models. in this review, we introduce multi-scale and multi-physical models for understanding disease development, progression, and designing clinical interventions. we begin with multi-scale models of cardiac electrophysiology and mechanics for diagnosis, clinical decision support, personalized and precision medicine in cardiology with examples in arrhythmia and heart failure. we then introduce computational models of vasculature mechanics and associated mechanical forces for understanding vascular disease progression, designing clinical interventions, and elucidating mechanisms that underlie diverse vascular conditions. we conclude with a discussion of barriers that must be overcome to provide enhanced insights, predictions, and decisions in pre-clinical and clinical applications.
strength_of_materials	the paper presents research of durability (static long-lasting life and fatigue life) of selected adhesive composites belzona, which are epoxy adhesives physically modified with metallic and ceramic fillers. the tests were conducted by determining creep curves, short-term strength of lap joints, static long-lasting life of adhesive joints and adhesive composites. numerical calculations, conducted with the finite element method, were made in order to explain (on the basis of distribution of stress and strain) the phenomena occurring during a long-term load of an adhesive-bonded joint, which are unobservable during experimental research. with regard to comparative analysis' needs, the research results gained for belzona composites were compared to the results gained for an adhesive based on physically unmodified epidian 57 epoxy composition hardened with triethylenetetramine (epidian 57/teta).
enzymology	in the spirit of gillespie 's stochastic approach we have formulated a theory to explore the advancement of the interfacial enzyme kinetics at the single enzyme level which is ultimately utilized to obtain the ensemble average macroscopic feature, lag-burst kinetics. we have provided a theory of the transition from the lag phase to the burst phase kinetics by considering the gradual development of electrostatic interaction among the positively charged enzyme and negatively charged product molecules deposited on the phospholipid surface. it is shown that the different diffusion time scales of the enzyme over the fluid and product regions are responsible for the memory effect in the correlation of successive turnover events of the hopping mode in the single trajectory analysis which again is reflected on the non-gaussian distribution of turnover times on the macroscopic kinetics in the lag phase unlike the burst phase kinetics.

northern_blotting	obesity has been linked to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, with elevated markers of systemic inflammation. intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) is a transmembrane adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. in human obesity, elevated expression of the soluble form of icam-1 (sicam-1) is positively correlated with abdominal fat deposition. increases in adiposity have also been correlated with macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. here we investigate adipose tissue production and transcriptional regulation of icam-1 in a mouse model of dietary obesity. after feeding mice a high-fat diet, icam-1 expression in serum and adipose tissue was analyzed by elisa, northern blotting, real-time quantitative pcr, and flow cytometry. after 6 mo on the high-fat diet, sicam-1 levels significantly correlated with body weight and abdominal fat mass. icam-1 mrna was expressed in adipose tissue of mice, with significantly higher levels in males than females. after only 3 wk, there were adipose tissue-specific increases in mrnas for icam-1, il-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) in male mice. analysis of the stromal-vascular fraction of male adipose tissue revealed cd11b-negative cells with increased surface icam-1 and cd34. we also found two populations of f4/80+, cd11b+, icam-1+ cells, one of which also expressed cd14 and cd11c and was increased in response to a high-fat diet. these results indicate that within 3 wk on a high-fat diet, male mice exhibited significant increases in pro-inflammatory factors and immune cell infiltration in adipose tissue that may represent links between obesity and its associated inflammatory complications.
thermodynamics	more than 20 countries are still suffering problems of excessive fluoride containing water, and greater than 8 mg/l fluoride groundwater has been reported in some villages in china. in order to meet the challenge in the drinking water defluoridation engineering, a high efficiency and affinity defluoridation adsorbent ppy/tio2 composite was designed and synthetized by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), x-ray diffraction investigator (xrd), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps), thermogravimetric analysis (tg), n-2 isotherm analysis, scanning electron microscopy (sem) and zeta potential analysis were conducted to characterize surface and textural properties of the as-prepared ppy/tio2, and the possibility of fluoride adsorption was carefully estimated by adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies. characterization investigations demonstrate the uniqueness of surface and textural properties, such as suitable specific surface area and abundant positively charged nitrogen atoms (n+), which indicate the composite is a suitable material for the fluoride adsorption. adsorption isotherms and kinetics follow better with langmuir and pseudo-second-order model, respectively. the maximum adsorption capacity reaches 33.178 mg/g at 25 degrees c according to langmuir model, and particular interest was the ability to reduce the concentration of fluoride from 11.678 mg/l to 1.5 mg/l for drinking water at ph of 7 within 30 min. moreover, the adsorbent can be easily recycled without the loss of adsorption capacity after six cycles, greatly highlighting its outstanding affinity to fluoride, low-cost and novel to be used in the purification of fluoride containing water for drinking. furthermore, the adsorption mechanism was extensively investigated and discussed by ftir investigation and batch adsorption studies including effect of ph, surface potential and thermodynamics. the adsorption is confirmed to be a spontaneous and exothermic process with decreasing entropy, which is prominently conducted through electrostatic attraction, and ionic exchange, and chelation may be also involved. hydroxyls and positively charged nitrogen atoms play important roles in the adsorption.

machine_design	although the brushless doubly-fed induction machine (dfim) has great potential as generator system in large-scale wind turbines, its complexity has so far retained a commercial breakthrough. this paper contributes by combining brushless dfim finite element (fe) modelling with multi-objective optimization. a static brushless dfim fe model is applied with the nsga-ii multi-objective optimization algorithm. the result is an accurate and fast brushless dfim design optimization tool. this tool is then used to generate a machine design with optimized performance, that fits a fixed volume frame size d180. optimization results of different brushless dfim construction variations are compared. the best designs of each construction variation are then analysed in more detail using a time-stepping brushless dfim fe model. this provides good insight in the effects of different construction variations on torque ripple and induced time-harmonics. the optimized design of the best construction variation will be selected to be manufactured as prototype machine.
enzymology	anticoagulant heparin has been shown to possess important biological functions that vary according to its fine structure. variability within heparin 's structure occurs owing to its biosynthesis and animal tissue-based recovery and adds another dimension to its complex polymeric structure. the structural variations in chain length and sulfation patterns mediate its interaction with many heparin-binding proteins, thereby eliciting complex biological responses. the advent of novel chemical and enzymatic approaches for polysaccharide synthesis coupled with high throughput combinatorial approaches for drug discovery have facilitated an increased effort to understand heparin 's structure-activity relationships. an improved understanding would offer potential for new therapeutic development through the engineering of polysaccharides. such a bioengineering approach requires the amalgamation of several different disciplines, including carbohydrate synthesis, applied enzymology, metabolic engineering, and process biochemistry.
enzymology	in mycobacteria, polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrpss) produce complex lipidic metabolites by using a thio-template mechanism of catalysis. in this study, we demonstrate that off-loading reductase (r) domain of mycobacterial nrpss performs two consecutive [2 + 2]e(-) reductions to release thioester-bound lipopeptides as corresponding alcohols, using a nonprocessive mechanism of catalysis. the first crystal structure of an r domain from mycobacterium tuberculosis nrps provides strong support to this mechanistic model and suggests that the displacement of intermediate would be required for cofactor recycling. we show that 4e(-) reductases produce alcohols through a committed aldehyde intermediate, and the reduction of this intermediate is at least 10 times more efficient than the thioester-substrate. structural and biochemical studies also provide evidence for the conformational changes associated with the reductive cycle. further, we show that the large substrate-binding pocket with a hydrophobic platform accounts for the remarkable substrate promiscuity of these domains. our studies present an elegant example of the recruitment of a canonical short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family member as an off-loading domain in the context of assembly-line enzymology.
immunology	the identification of an antigenic epitope by the immune system allows for the understanding of the protective mechanism of neutralizing antibodies that may facilitate the development of vaccines and peptide drugs. peptide scanning is a simple and efficient method that straightforwardly maps the linear epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mab). here, the authors present an epitope determination methodology involving serially truncated recombinant proteins, synthetic peptide design, and dot-blot hybridization for the antigenic recognition of nervous necrosis virus coat protein using a neutralizing mab. this technique relies on the dot-blot hybridization of synthetic peptides and mabs on a polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) membrane. the minimum antigenic region of a viral coat protein recognized by the rg-m56 mab can be narrowed down by step-by-step trimmed peptide mapping onto a 6-mer peptide epitope. in addition, alanine scanning mutagenesis and residue substitution can be performed to characterize the binding significance of each amino acid residue making up the epitope. the residues flanking the epitope site were found to play critical roles in peptide conformation regulation. the identified epitope peptide may be used to form crystals of epitope peptide-antibody complexes for an x-ray diffraction study and functional competition, or for therapeutics.
polymerase_chain_reaction	rapid methods for the detection and clinical treatment of human norovirus (hunov) are needed to control foodborne disease outbreaks, but reliable techniques that are fast and sensitive enough to detect small amounts of hunov in food and aquatic environments are not yet available. we explore the interactions between hunov and concanavalin a (con a), which could facilitate the development of a sensitive detection tool for hunov. biophysical studies including hydrogen/deuterium exchange (hdx) mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance (spr) revealed that when the metal coordinated region of con a, which spans asp16 to his24, is converted to nine alanine residues (mcon am), the affinity for hunov (gii.4) diminishes, demonstrating that this ca2+ and mn2+ coordinated region is responsible for the observed virus-protein interaction. the mutated carbohydrate binding region of con a (mcon a(cbr)) does not affect binding affinity significantly, indicating that mcr of con a is a major region of interaction to hunov (gii.4). the results further contribute to the development of a hunov concentration tool, con a-immobilized polyacrylate beads (con a-pab), for rapid detection of genotypes from genogroups i and ii (gi and gii). this method offers many advantages over currently available methods, including a short concentration time. hunov (gi and gii) can be detected in just 15 min with 90% recovery through con a-pab application. in addition, this method can be used over a wide range of ph values (ph 3.0 - 10.0). overall, this rapid and sensitive detection of hunov (cl and gii) will aid in the prevention of virus transmission pathways, and the method developed here may have applicability for other foodborne viral infections.

machine_design	because of high frequency and rotation speed, the analysis and design methods of high speed machine are different from conventional ones, such as rotor stress calculation, rotor dynamics analysis and electromagnetic design. in view of an outer rotor permanent magnet claw pole machine proposed, the claw pole and wingding were designed and analyzed by equivalent magnetic circuit and finite element method (fem); the rotor stress distribution were calculated to check its strength; and the rotor bending mode and critical speed were simulated to analyze dynamics properties. finally, a prototype of 1.5kw was developed, then the test research of prototype was carried out, the feasibility and accuracy of theoretical analysis have been verified by experimentation.
strength_of_materials	the thermal shock behavior of ceramics with the cooling medium temperatures in the range 5 degrees c to 100 degrees c has been studied in detail by measuring the retained flexural strength after water quenching. the test materials is zro2(3y). results show that the thermal shock resistance of ceramics is very sensitive to the cooling medium temperature, even which is very low. when characterizing the thermal shock resistance of ceramics the effect of cooling medium temperature should be taken into account. a higher water-bath temperature may not correspond to a greater thermal shock resistance of ceramic materials owing to the effect or thermal shock initial temperature on the material properties. when the temperature difference in thermal shock is close to the critical temperature difference or rupture, a little change of which can cause a great change in the retained strength of materials. as the retained strength of materials is too sensitive to the temperature difference close to the critical temperature difference of rupture, it is unsuitable to use the critical temperature difference of rupture to characterize the thermal shock resistance of ceramic materials. this study shows some innegligible problems in the evaluation system for the thermal shock resistance of ceramic materials.

human_metabolism	the n-acetyl-s-(1-carbamoyl-2-hydroxy-ethyl)-l-cysteine (iso-gama) could be identified as a further human metabolite of acrylamide. in this study, we report the excretion of d(3)-iso-gama in human urine after single oral administration of deuterium labelled acrylamide (d(3)-aa). one healthy male volunteer ingested a dose of about 1 mg d(3)-aa which is equivalent to a dose of 13 mu g/kg bodyweight. over a period of 46 h the urine was collected and the d(3)-iso-gama levels analysed by lc-esi-ms/ms. the excretion of iso-gama begins five hours after application. it rises to a maximum concentration (c (max)) of 43 mu g/l which was quantified in the urine excreted after 22 h (t (max)). the excretion pattern is parallel to that of the major oxidative metabolite n-acetyl-s-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxy-ethyl)-l-cysteine (gama). total recovery of iso-gama was about 1% of the applied dose. together with n-acetyl-s-(2-carbamoylethyl)-l-cysteine (aama) and gama, 57% of the applied dose is eliminated as mercapturic acids. the elimination kinetics of the three mercapturic acids of aa are compared. we show that dietary doses of acrylamide (aa) cause an overload of detoxification via aama and lead to the formation of carcinogenic glycidamide (ga) in the human body.
manufacturing_engineering	indoor positioning techniques are being considered for use within team sports where players are tracked and recorded providing coaching assistance. while global positioning system (gps) is the de facto standard employed to estimate the location of players, this is unsuitable for accurate indoor positioning due to roof and wall signal obstruction. over a dozen techniques have been suggested for wireless indoor positioning of static and/or moving objects with improved methods for limiting the position estimation errors. for those indoor techniques that rely on radio frequency (rf) signal propagation, propagation statistics are useful in determining path loss and signal degradation. this static indoor propagation knowledge is critical in the design of wireless indoor positioning systems and ultimately the accuracy of the position estimation. signal path propagation losses and variations produced from shadowing, multipath, fading, scattering or diffraction from objects can hinder the designer 's efforts to provide a reliable and accurate positioning system. however, sporting indoor environments generally have an open floor area where play is conducted free from objects apart from the players themselves. at the elite sporting level these indoor play areas are designed and constructed under international specifications. consequently, static wireless rf signal propagation knowledge obtained from one of these commonly built play areas is applicable to hundreds of other venues around the world. many of these indoor sporting areas are used for a variety of sports, for example, basketball, volleyball, indoor cricket, indoor soccer, netball and handball. a player positioning installation could potentially be used for all of these sports. this paper reports the wireless rf signal propagation of a 2.4ghz waist mounted beacon for an indoor sporting venue 'play area', which has been designed to international standards. a basketball court constructed of highly polished wood was chosen as the sample 'play area'. propagation models are discussed and comparisons between predicted and measured results demonstrate the validity of the technique.

thermodynamics	shear banding is observed in many soft materials. we recently developed a two-fluid model for semidilute entangled polymer solutions by using the generalized bracket approach of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. this model assumes that fickian diffusion and stress-induced migration generate a nontrivial velocity difference between the polymers and the solution, thereby resulting in shear band formation. a straightforward implementation of the slip boundary conditions is possible because the differential velocity is treated as a state variable. numerical calculations showed obvious shear banding in the polymer concentration profile. increasing the pressure gradient reduces the inhomogeneity of the concentration profile and moves the transition region toward the center of the channel. moreover, the velocity deviates from the typical parabolic form and shows a plug-like profile with a low shear band near the center and a high one near the walls. the lack of hysteresis in the profiles of the volumetric flow rate calculated with the increasing and decreasing pressure gradient demonstrates the uniqueness of the solution. in addition, the flow rate exhibits a spurt at a critical pressure gradient, as experimentally observed for shear banding materials. the simplicity of the new model encourages us to analyze it in more complicated flows.

manufacturing_engineering	today, manufacturing is being shaped by the paradigm shift from mass production to on demand dictated, personalized, customer-driven and knowledge-based proactive production. thus, shorter product life cycles, an increased number of product varieties, high performance processes, flexible machines and production systems result in an increased complexity in all factory level domains from product design, process development, factory and production planning to factory operation. to handle this complexity, new knowledge-based methods, technologies and tools to model, simulate, optimize and monitor planned and existing manufacturing systems are required. this paper presents the challenges, the approach and an overview of the results of the eu-fp7 funded project apps4ame (ga no 314156) and provides a concise overview over the engineering apps (eapps) approach that the project is based on. the project aims at the comprehensive consideration of ict-based support of manufacturing engineering in all the above mentioned domains, called advanced manufacturing engineering (ame). the different life cycles are aligned by the development of a reference data model that provides a detailed overview of all relevant domain-specific and inter-domain interdependencies. this life cycle-oriented model enables an integrated product design, process development, factory planning as well as production planning and factory operation. all stakeholders in these activities are supported by eapps that are conceived, developed and validated with the help of four industrial use cases spanning very diverse industrial branches.

human_metabolism	laxative senna products and several of their specific components have been submitted to a large number of genetic tests. while most studies gave negative responses, results from some of the studies suggest that components of senna products, particularly emodin and aloe-emodin, have genotoxic activity. assessment of the genotoxicity profile of these substances, in light of other data from animal and human metabolism or kinetic studies, human clinical trials and rodent carcinogenicity studies do not support concerns that senna laxatives pose a genotoxic risk to humans when consumed under prescribed use conditions.

computer-aided_design	the demand for electricity production has been consistently raising since the last century. in the future, the tendency is to grow even further. concerning this fact, renewable energy and specifically, wave energy should be considered as an alternative for energy production. however, devices suitable to harness this renewable energy source and convert it into electricity are not yet commercially competitive. this paper is focused on the structural analysis of a wave energy converter (wec) through the numerical study of several design parameters. tridimensional computer aided design (3d cad) numerical models were built and several finite element analyses (fea) were performed using a commercial finite element code. the main components of the wec were simulated assuming different materials. the von mises stress gradients and displacement fields determined by fea demonstrated that, regardless of the wec component, materials with low young 's modulus seems to be unsuitable for this application. the same is valid for the material yield strength since materials with higher yield strength lead to a better structural behavior of the wec components. the developed 3d
strength_of_materials	various designated precipitation hardening and cold working have been employed to improve mechanical properties of aluminum magnesium silicon alloys. the aim of this study is to study how both high strength and excellent ductility could be achieved. two main processes are competing to each other when the cold working is combined with precipitation hardening. they are dislocation annihilation during age treatment which improves ductility; and dislocation pinning by precipitates which increases strength of materials. in this paper, the mechanical properties of cold rolled aa6061 sheets in pre-aging, single and double aging conditions were compared. the different sequences of precipitation hardening and cold working were employed to achieve both high strength and excellent ductility. the results show that the amount of initial cold rolling and pre-aging may have negligible effect on the strength and hardness but significant effect on the ductility of alloy.
polymerase_chain_reaction	octamer 4 (oct4), a member of the pit-oct-unc transcription factor family required to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, has been previously identified to be associated with tumorigenesis and malignant transformation of numerous types of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). the present data shows that oct4 enhances cancer stem cell properties and increases invasion ability in the huh7 cell line. to increase understanding of the role of oct4 in hcc, the present study used a functional genomics approach and analyzed the resulting transcriptional profiles to identify oct4-dependent genes in huh7. affymetrix genechip human genome u133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to determine differential gene expression profiles and then validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. the present study found that altered expression of 673 genes (fold-change >= 2) affected multiple signaling pathways linked with self-renew and metastasis. among these differentially expressed genes, the present study noticed that the key component of the wnt signaling pathway lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (lef1) and twist family bhlh transcription factor 1 were upregulated by oct4, whilst cadherin 2 was downregulated. additional studies found that the nuclear beta-catenin aggregation was increased in oct4 overexpressed hcc cell lines. these results suggest that oct4 regulates lef1 to active lef1/beta-catenin dependent wnt signaling pathway and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition. the present findings provide novel mechanistic insight into an important role of oct4 in hcc.
cell_biology	background: lake malawi cichlids represent one of a growing number of vertebrate models used to uncover the genetic and developmental basis of trait diversity. rapid evolutionary radiation has resulted in species that share similar genomes but differ markedly in phenotypes including brains and behavior, nuptial coloration and the craniofacial skeleton. research has begun to identify the genes, as well as the molecular and developmental pathways that underlie trait divergence. results: we assemble a compendium of gene expression for lake malawi cichlids, across pharyngula (the phylotypic stage) and larval stages of development, encompassing hundreds of gene transcripts. we chart patterns of expression in bone morphogenetic protein (bmp), fibroblast growth factor (fgf), hedgehog (hh), notch and wingless (wnt) signaling pathways, as well as genes involved in neurogenesis, calcium and endocrine signaling, stem cell biology, and numerous homeobox (hox) factors-in three planes using whole-mount in situ hybridization. because of low sequence divergence across the malawi cichlid assemblage, the probes we employ are broadly applicable in hundreds of species. we tabulate gene expression across general tissue domains, and highlight examples of unexpected expression patterns. conclusions: on the heels of recently published genomes, this compendium of developmental gene expression in lake malawi cichlids provides a valuable resource for those interested in the relationship between evolution and development.
immunology	biomaterial vaccines offer new capabilities that can be exploited for both infectious disease and cancer. we recently developed a novel vaccine platform based on self-assembly of immune signals into immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (ipems). these ipem vaccines are electrostatically assembled from peptide antigens and nucleic acid-based toll-like receptor agonists (tlras) that serve as molecular adjuvants. gold nanoparticles (aunps) coated with ipems stimulate effector cytokine secretion in vitro and expand antigen-specific t cells in mice. here we investigated how the dose, injection route, and choice of molecular adjuvant impacts the ability of ipems to generate t cell immunity and anti-tumor response in mice. three injection routesintradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscularand three ipem dosing levels were employed. intradermal injection induced the most potent antigen-specific t cell responses and, for all routes, the level of response was dose-dependent. we further discovered that these vaccines generate durable memory, indicated by potent, antigen-specific cd8(+) t cell recall responses in mice challenged with vaccine 49 days after a prime-boost immunization regimen. in a common exogenous antigen melanoma model, ipem vaccines slowed or stopped tumor growth more effectively than equivalent ad-mixed formulations. further, ipems containing cpga tlr9awere more potent compared with ipems containing polyic, a tlr3a. these findings demonstrate the ability of ipems to enhance response to several different classes of vaccine cargos, supporting ipems as a simple vaccine platform that mimics attractive features of other nanoparticles using immune signals that can be self-assembled or coated on substrates. biotechnol. bioeng. 2017;114: 423-431.

strength_of_materials	cutting strength is proposed as a new indicator of the resistance of materials to cutting. this indicator is the ratio of the cutting force in the orthogonal cutting and the cross section of the part of the specimen to be cut. it essentially depends only on the property of the material and is independent of the cutting width or depth. it can also give an indication of the resistance of surfaces to scratching. 2011 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
computer-aided_design	background and aim: prosthetic cad/cam systems require accurate 3d limb models; however, difficulties arise when working from the person 's socket since current 3d scanners have difficulties scanning socket interiors. while dedicated scanners exist, they are expensive and the cost may be prohibitive for a limited number of scans per year. a low-cost and accessible photogrammetry method for socket interior digitization is proposed, using a smartphone camera and cloud-based photogrammetry services. technique: 15 two-dimensional images of the socket 's interior are captured using a smartphone camera. a 3d model is generated using cloud-based software. linear measurements were comparing between sockets and the related 3d models. discussion: 3d reconstruction accuracy averaged 2.6 +/- 2.0 mm and 0.086 +/- 0.078 l, which was less accurate than models obtained by high quality 3d scanners. however, this method would provide a viable 3d digital socket reproduction that is accessible and low-cost, after processing in prosthetic cad software.
genetics	oenococcus oeni is a wine-associated lactic acid bacterium (lab) responsible mostly for wine malolactic fermentation (mlf). this fastidious bacterium (auxotrophic for many amino acids and slow growing) possesses remarkable adaptability to harsh physicochemical conditions and can reprogramme its metabolic pathways to enhance its survival in wine. thus, o. oeni is an instructive bacterial model for investigating stress response mechanisms in lab. however, the lack of appropriate techniques to modify the o. oeni genome has hampered molecular studies of this species. the application of recent advances in molecular genetics promises to provide a better understanding of the regulation of stress responses in this species in the future.
genetics	evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models. yet only one result, fisher 's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. i argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. i suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: fisher 's average-excess equation, robertson 's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder 's equation, and fisher 's fundamental theorem. these derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. a key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy. quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics, probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues.
northern_blotting	the arabidopsis thaliana bzip60 (atbzip60) transcription factor regulates stress signaling. however, its involvement in plant salt tolerance is not fully understood. in this investigation, cell suspension cultures of three different plant species: tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), rice (oryza sativa l.), and slash pine (pinus elliottii engelm.) were transformed via agrobacterium tumefaciens lba4404 harboring pbi-atbzip60deltac. integration of atbzip60deltac into the genome of tobacco, rice, or slash pine has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, southern blotting, and northern blotting analyses. six transgenic cell lines from each of three species were used to analyze the salt tolerance conferred by the overexpression of atbzip60deltac. our results demonstrated that expression of atbzip60deltac enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic cells in all transgenic lines and that improved salt tolerance was associated with increased activities of both ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, and decreased lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances). this investigation has demonstrated that the expression of atbzip60deltac gene in transgenic cell lines attenuated salt-induced oxidative damage by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the overexpression of atbzip60deltac gene could be an alternative choice for engineering plant salt tolerance.
fluid_mechanics	this paper is concerned with approximations of the boltzmann equation based on the method of moments. we propose a generalization of the setting of the moment-closure problem from relative entropy to -divergences and a corresponding closure procedure based on minimization of -divergences. the proposed description encapsulates as special cases grad 's classical closure based on expansion in hermite polynomials and levermore 's entropy-based closure. we establish that the generalization to divergence-based closures enables the construction of extended thermodynamic theories that avoid essential limitations of the standard moment-closure formulations such as inadmissibility of the approximate phase-space distribution, potential loss of hyperbolicity and singularity of flux functions at local equilibrium. the divergence-based closure leads to a hierarchy of tractable symmetric hyperbolic systems that retain the fundamental structural properties of the boltzmann equation.
strength_of_materials	determining the residual stress during casting processes is important for evaluating the mechanical properties and strength of materials and to optimize manufacturing conditions. in this study, we propose a field data interface procedure between fdm and fem in a 3-dimensional space for analyzing the casting process and structural analysis. the casting process was analyzed using fdm and the data of the temperature distribution were converted into a format suitable for fem analysis to calculate the thermal stress and safety factor by tightening force. the results of the coupled analysis between fdm and fem showed that casting residual stress is an important factor in predicting life time and evaluating durability.
genetics	natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (nramp) encoded by the slc11a1 gene is a membrane-associated transporter of divalent metal ions. murine slc11a1 has two known alleles, a functional slc11a1(gly169), which is found in dba2/j, nod/ltj, and 129p3/j and related mouse strains, and a non-functional slc11a1(asp169), that is found in c56bl/6j (b6) and balb/cj mice. b6 mice congenic for slc11a1(gly169) (b6-slc11a1(g169)) are markedly resistant to the intracellular pathogens salmonella, leishmania, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. we examined the host cell response and replication of francisella in b6-slc11a1(g169) mice. bone marrow-derived macrophages from either b6-slc11a1(g169) or b6 mice were both effectively invaded by francisella live vaccine strain (lvs). however, at 16 hours post-infection (hpi), the number of lvs bacteria recovered from b6 macrophages had increased roughly 100-fold, while in b6-slc11a1(g169) mice the number decreased 10-fold. when the mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) b6 mice lost significant amounts (similar to 15%) of weight, where as b6-slc11a1(g169) mice lost no weight. three days after infection in b6-slc11a1(g169) mice, we failed to recover viable francisella from the lungs, livers, or spleens. by contrast, b6 mice had bacterial burdens approaching 1x10(6) cfu/organ in all three organs. to further examine the degree of resistance imparted by slc11a1(gly169) expression, we challenged mice deficient in tlr2, tlr4, and tlr9, but expressing the functional slc11a1 (b6-slc11a1(g169) tlr2/4/9(-/-)). surprisingly, b6-slc11a1(g169) tlr2/4/9(-/-)mice had no notable weight loss. eighty percent of b6-slc11a1(g169) tlr2/4/9(-/-)mice yielded no detectable francisella in any organ tested. additionally, slc11a1(g169) produced little detectable cytokine either in the lung or serum compared to b6 mice. mice expressing slc11a1(gly169) survived even high doses (similar to 80 ld50) of lvs inoculation. these data taken together serve to highlight that functional slc11a1(gly169) can compensate the lack of tlr2/4/9. thus slc11a1 is a critical player in murine resistance to pulmonary francisella infection, but not footpad infection.
polymerase_chain_reaction	invasive candidiasis remains one of the most serious community and healthcare-acquired infections worldwide. conventional candida detection methods based on blood and plate culture are time-consuming and require at least 2-4 days to identify various candida species. despite considerable advances for candidiasis detection, the development of simple, compact and portable point-of-care diagnostics for rapid and precise testing that automatically performs cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, purification and detection still remains a challenge. here, we systematically review most prominent conventional and nonconventional techniques for the detection of various candida species, including candida staining, blood culture, serological testing and nucleic acid-based analysis. we also discuss the most advanced lab on a chip devices for candida detection.
cell_biology	advances in understanding adult stem cell biology have facilitated the development of novel cell-based therapies for cancer. recent developments in conventional therapies (eg, tumor resection techniques, chemotherapy strategies, and radiation therapy) for treating both metastatic and primary tumors in the brain, particularly glioblastoma have not resulted in a marked increase in patient survival. preclinical studies have shown that multiple stem cell types exhibit inherent tropism and migrate to the sites of malignancy. recent studies have validated the feasibility potential of using engineered stem cells as therapeutic agents to target and eliminate malignant tumor cells in the brain. this review will discuss the recent progress in the therapeutic potential of stem cells for tumors in the brain and also provide perspectives for future preclinical studies and clinical translation.
strength_of_materials	this paper presents an alternative to the theoretical classic teaching methods generally used in strength of materials or solids mechanics. it introduces a dynamic and interactive process, with emphasis in the use of esa-experimental stress analysis, especially strain gauges and photoelasticity. in addition to the didactic and practical experiments, the students used all their energy and creativity to develop the interesting results presented here, such as, experimental device for measuring displacement, buckling, spaghetti and popsicle sticks bridges, stress analysis in a cylinder block and mini baja project.
immunology	it is possible that during long lasting chronic infections such as tuberculosis (tb) and leprosy individuals who generate a stronger immune response will produce a chronic shift in the systemic levels of inflammatory proteins. consequently, the systemic immunological shift could affect inflammatory responses against other persistent pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease (pd). objectiveto determine if in vitro exposure to mycobacterium tuberculosis or m. leprae lysates impacts subsequent immune responses to p. gingivalis; and to propose a new dialogue between experimental immunology and paleopathology. material and methodswe sequentially (2 days protocol) exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy donors to bacterial lysates either from m. tuberculosis, or m. leprae, or p. gingivalis. after collecting all supernatants, we measured the expression of immune proteins tnf and ifn using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. resultsearly exposure (day 1) of pbmcs to m. leprae or m. tuberculosis lysates induces an inflammatory shift detected by the increase of tnf and ifn when the same cells are subsequently (day 2) exposed to oral pathogen p. gingivalis. discussionby extrapolating these results, we suggest that chronic infections, such as tb and leprosy, could generate a systemic immunological shift that can affect other inflammatory processes such the one present in pd. we propose that the presence and severity of pd should be explored as a proxy for inflammatory status or competence when reconstructing the health profile in past populations.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: sensitive methods for detecting asymptomatic malaria infections are essential for identifying potential transmission reservoirs and obtaining an accurate assessment of malaria epidemiology in low-endemicity areas aiming to eliminate malaria. pcr techniques to detect parasite nucleic acids (dna or rna) are among the most commonly used molecular methods. however, most of these methods are of low throughput and cannot be used for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies. a recently developed capture and ligation probe-pcr (clip-pcr) is claimed to have the sensitivity of molecular techniques and the high throughput capacity needed for screening purposes. this study aimed to compare several molecular methods for detecting asymptomatic and submicroscopic plasmodium infections in healthy residents of a malaria-hypoendemic region in southeast asia, where malaria elimination is in sight. method: this study compared three molecular detection methods side-by-side, namely nested pcr targeting the rrna genes, nested rt-pcr to detect parasite rrna, and clip-pcr to detect parasite rrna in 1005 healthy individuals in northeastern myanmar. for nested pcr and rt-pcr, parasite dna and total rna were extracted from similar to 100 mu l of blood, whereas rna used for clip-pcr was from a 3 mm disk of dried blood filter paper. the sensitivity and specificity of these methods were compared with those of conventional light microscopy. in addition, rt-pcr and quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) targeting the pvs25 gene in plasmodium vivax were used to assess gametocyte prevalence in the samples. results: light microscopy detected plasmodium infections in only 1.19% of the residents harbouring the parasites. clip-pcr had slightly better performance and detected plasmodium infections in 1.89% of the population. further improvement was achieved by nested pcr to detect parasite dna, which detected p.vivax and plasmodium falciparum infections in 2.39% of the residents. the nested rt-pcr targeting rrna, however, detected as many as 187 (18.61%) individuals having plasmodium infections with p. vivax being the predominant species (176 p. vivax, 5 p. falciparum and 6 p. falciparum/p.vivax mixed infections). of the 210 plasmodium-positive samples detected by all molecular methods, 115 were pvs25-positive by qrt-pcr, indicating that a large proportion of asymptomatic individuals were gametocyte carriers. conclusion: nested rt-pcr based on the detection of asexual-stage parasite rrna was the most sensitive, with a more than sixfold higher sensitivity than the other two molecular methods of parasite detection. clip-pcr has an increased throughput, but its sensitivity in this study was much lower than those of other molecular methods, which may be partially due to the smaller amount of rna input used.
cell_biology	purpose of review the purpose of the present review is to provide an update on the current development in the field of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) and their potential use in the prevention and therapeutic settings, and an evaluation of the b-cell abnormalities that may impair antibody responses in hiv infection. recent findings major advances have been achieved in the characterization of bnabs directed against different vulnerable regions of hiv envelope (env). recent observations have clearly demonstrated the ability of bnabs to prevent hiv infection in the nonhuman primate model of hiv infection and to suppress viremia in individuals with chronic hiv infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. furthermore, substantial advances have also been obtained in the development of hiv env proteins and immunization strategies inducing bnabs in small animal models. several studies have also shed light on the b-cell abnormalities associated with the viremic phase of hiv infection that cause impaired b-cell maturation and antibody responses. of note, preliminary observations have provided evidence for a correlation between the expansion of a specific population of b cells, for example, germinal center b cells, the expansion of t follicular helper cells (tfh), and the generation of neutralizing antibodies. summary the recent observations on the antiviral effects of bnabs in vivo indicate that bnabs may play a central role in both the prevention and the therapeutic settings. the identification of the role of germinal center b cells and tfh cells as critical components of the immune response leading to the generation of neutralizing antibodies, will allow the development of specific immunization strategies for the stimulation of germinal center b cells and tfh cells. a lot of work still remains to be done for the delineation of b-cell and tfh cell biology from human lymphoid tissues and in the development of hiv env proteins and immunization strategies leading to the generation of bnabs.
molecular_biology	the reductionist approach of dissecting biological systems into their constituents has been successful in the first stage of the molecular biology to elucidate the chemical basis of several biological processes. this knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus, realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations. thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. on the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on ppis. based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the ppi and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. in particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application. their use to infer biological knowledge will be shown, and a special attention will be devoted to the topological and module analysis.
enzymology	gangliosides are important signaling molecules in the cell membrane and are processed by several enzymes. deficiencies in these enzymes can cause human lysosomal storage diseases. building an understanding of the pathways of glycosphingolipid catabolism requires methods for the analysis of these enzymatic activities agm3-derived fret probe was synthesized chemoenzymatically for the detection and quantitation of a range of ganglioside-degrading enzymes, both in cell lysates and in living cells. this is the first substrate that enables the ratiometric fluorogenic assay of sphingolipid ceramide ndeacylase and endoglycoceramidase and can detect and localize neuraminidase activity in living cells. it is therefore a valuable tool for building a better understanding of membrane-confined enzymology. it also enables the robust and reliable assay of ganglioside-degrading enzymes in a microtiter plate, thus opening the door to screening for novel or engineered biocatalysts or for new inhibitors.
polymerase_chain_reaction	some species of the arcobacter genus are considered emerging foodborne and waterborne en. however, the presence of arcobacter spp. in vegetables very little is known, because most studies have focused on foods of animal origin. on the other hand, quinolones are considered as first-line drugs for the treatment of infection by campylobacteria in human patients, but few data are currently available about the resistance levels to these antibiotics among arcobacter species. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and diversity of arcobacters isolated from fresh vegetables such as lettuces, spinaches, chards and cabbages. resistance to quinolones of the isolates was also investigated. one hundred fresh vegetables samples purchased from seven local retail markets in valencia (spain) during eight months were analysed. the study included 41 lettuces, 21 spinaches, 34 chards and 4 cabbages. samples were analysed by culture and by molecular methods before and after enrichment. by culture, 17 out of 100 analysed samples were arcobacter positive and twenty-five isolates were obtained from them. direct detection by pcr was low, with only 4% arcobacter spp. positive samples. this percentage increased considerably, up 20%, after 48 h enrichment. by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp), 17 out of the 25 isolates were identified as a. butzleri and 8 as a. cryaerophilus. only two a. butzleri isolates showed resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. the sequencing of a fragment of the qrdr region of the gyra gene from the quinolones-resistant isolates revealed the presence of a mutation in position 254 of this gene (c-t transition). this study is the first report about the presence of pathogenic species of arcobacter spp. in chards and cabbages and confirms that fresh vegetables can act as transmission vehicle to humans. moreover, the presence of a. butzleri quinolone resistant in vegetables could pose a potential public health risk.

computer-aided_design	structured-light (sl) depth sensors are widely used because of their simplicity in design and ability to process depth data with minimal computational expense. certain sl light coding methods can, however, lead to a loss of information, as well as inhomogeneous depth errors that depend on the composition and properties of the scene. this results in a reduction of potential accuracy for model-based pose estimation methods that operate on the depth images or subsequently transformed three-dimensional point clouds, such as the popular class of point set registration (psr) methods. we therefore formulate an asymptotically optimal maximum likelihood estimation (mle) method that operates directly on the raw sl infrared (ir) images. the proposed slir-mle method maximizes the likelihood of the measured ir image over the pose region given the object model, sensor model, and calibrated speckle and thermal noise distributions. we also formulate a method to compute the fisher information contained in the ir image and resulting cramer-rao bound (crb) of any unbiased pose estimator for unique sl sensor measurement data. slir-mle is shown to nearly achieve the calculated crb for the kinect sensor by operating on the more informative raw ir images. furthermore, our method is shown to outperform two cutting edge psr methods by an order of magnitude in the respective mean square errors.
materials_engineering	the present study is concerned with a numerical analysis of the uncertainties in the response of foam core sandwich structures caused by the uncertain microstructure of the core material. in the sense of an integrated computational materials engineering type approach, a three-step procedure is proposed. in the first step, the effective material properties of the core material are computed. for this purpose, a probabilistic homogenization procedure is adopted for the prediction of all elastic constants together with their probability distributions as well as all spatial correlations and interrelations between the individual parameters. in the second step, a random field model for the core material is derived, based on the homogenization results obtained in the first step. the random fields are found to reproduce all stochastic features of the uncertain core material in a proper manner. using the random field description as an input for a monte-carlo-type structural analysis, the uncertainties in the stiffness and strength of sandwich structures are computed in the third step. the capabilities of the proposed procedure are demonstrated using the example of a single edge clamped sandwich beam under transverse loads.

cell_biology	phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated (mek) signaling are central to the survival and proliferation of many cell types. multiple lines of investigation in murine models have shown that control of the pi3k pathway is particularly important for regulatory t cell (treg) stability and function. pi3k and mek inhibitors are being introduced into the clinic, and we hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition of pi3k, and possibly mek, in mixed cultures of human mononuclear cells would preferentially affect cd4(+) and cd8(+) lymphocytes compared with tregs. we tested this hypothesis using four readouts: proliferation, activation, functional suppression, and signaling. results showed that tregs were less susceptible to inhibition by both and isoform-specific pi3k inhibitors and by an mek inhibitor compared with their conventional cd4(+) and cd8(+) counterparts. these studies suggest less functional reliance on pi3k and mek signaling in tregs compared with conventional cd4(+) and cd8(+) lymphocytes. therefore, the pi3k and mek pathways are attractive pharmacologic targets for transplantation and treatment of autoimmunity. in vitro agents that block the pi-3 kinase and/or mek pathways preferentially block nonregulatory t cells, relatively sparing regulatory t cells, suggesting that these pathways may be attractive targets in transplantation.
cell_biology	limbal stemcell (lsc) deficiency is a visually debilitating condition caused by abnormal maintenance of lscs. it is treated by transplantation of donor-derived limbal epithelial cells (lecs), the success of which depends on the presence and quality of lscs with in the transplant. understanding the immunobiological responses of these cells within the transplants could improve cell engraftment and survival. however, human corneal rings used as a source of lscs are not always readily available for research purposes. as an alternative, we hypothesized that a human telomerase-immortalized corneal epithelial cell (htcec) line could be used as a model for studying lsc immunobiology. htcec constitutively expressed human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i but not class ii molecules. however, when stimulated by interferon-gamma, htcecs then expressed hla class ii antigens. some htcecs were also migratory in response to cxcl12 and expressed stem cell markers, nanog, oct4, and sox2. in addition because both htcecs and lecs contain side population (sp) cells, which are an enriched lsc population, we used these sp cells to show that some htcec sp cells coexpressed abcg2 and abcb5. htcec sp and non-side population (nsp) cells also expressed cxcr4, but the sp cells expressed higher levels. both were capable of colony formation, but the nsp colonies were smaller and contained fewer cells. in addition, htcecs expressed delta np63 alpha. these results suggest the htcecline is a useful model for further understanding lscbiology by using an in vitro approach without reliance on a supply of human tissue.
northern_blotting	we used pcr-based methods to clone and sequence four previously unidentified cellulase cdnas: cbhi-i, cbhi-ii, cbhii-i and egii. cbhi-i, cbhi-ii and cbhii-i consist of 1710, 1610 and 1453 bp, respectively, and encode for 512, 458 and 442 amino acids, respectively. egii consists of 1180bp encoding for 310 amino acids, and belongs to family 61 of the glycosyl hydrolases. cbhi-i, cbhii-i and egii all have a modular structure, with the catalytic domain (cd) and cellulose-binding domain (cbd) located at the c-terminus in cbhi-i and egii, and at the n-terminus in cbhii-i. cbhi-ii shows high homology to cbhi-i but lacks a cbd. northern blotting revealed that cbhi-i, cbhi-ii and cbhii-i were coordinately expressed at various stages of the mushroom developmental cycle (substrate colonization to mature fruit body), although the number of cbhi-i transcripts was much smaller. no egii expression was detectable during the substrate colonization phase but transcription levels increased as fruit body morphogenesis progressed.
immunology	group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ilc3), defined by expression of the transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t, play key roles in the regulation of inflammation and immunity in the gastrointestinal tract and associated lymphoid tissues. ilc3 consist largely of two major subsets, ncr+ ilc3 and lti-like ilc3, but also demonstrate significant plasticity and heterogeneity. recent advances have begun to dissect the relationship between ilc3 subsets and to define distinct functional states within the intestinal tissue microenvironment. in this review we discuss the ever-expanding roles of ilc3 in the context of intestinal homeostasis, infection and inflammation - with a focus on comparing and contrasting the relative contributions of ilc3 subsets.
molecular_biology	background/purpose: mutations in the tet oncogene family member 2 gene (tet2) are frequently found in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml). reports of tet2 mutations in children are limited. we assessed the prevalence of tet2 mutations in taiwanese children with aml and analyzed their prognosis. methods: between 1997 and 2010, a total of 69 consecutive children with aml were enrolled at the national taiwan university hospital. the analysis for tet2 mutations was performed using direct sequencing. clinical characteristics and overall survival (os) were compared between patients with and without tet2 alterations. results: intronic and missense mutations were identified. no nonsense or frameshift mutations were observed. two putative disease-causing missense mutations (s609c and a1865g) were identified in one patient. we estimated the prevalence of tet2 mutations in the current patient population to be 1.4%. the most common polymorphism was i1762v (45%), followed by v218m (12%), p29r (6%), and f868l (6%). patients with polymorphism i1762v had an increased 10-year survival rate compared with patients without i1762v (48.4% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.049) by chi-square test; os was not different when examined using the kaplan-meier method (p = 0.104). conclusion: the prevalence of tet2 mutations in children with aml compared with adults with aml was lower and less complex. patient prognosis associated with tet2 mutations in children requires further investigation. copyright (c) 2015, formosan medical association. published by elsevier taiwan llc.
materials_engineering	computational simulation tools have become critical components for supporting learning, as well as research, in both science and engineering. one objective of these tools is to help students develop deeper conceptual understanding of difficult concepts. this explanatory sequential mix-method design study characterizes the influence of the use of a computational tool called gibbs, on the students' understanding and representation of core concepts in thermodynamics. participants included 48 sophomore-engineering students from a large midwestern university who were enrolled in the course entitled ""thermodynamics of materials."" in the first phase, quantitative results examined students' conceptual understanding before and after being exposed to the computational tool as part of their laboratory session. in the second phase a qualitative evaluation characterized the nature of students' representational forms and the way they used them. results for the quantitative study revealed positive gains in students' conceptual understanding for the majority of the concepts tested. in addition, insight gained from the qualitative analysis identified how students' representational systems were used to support their conceptual understanding in thermodynamics of materials concepts.
genetics	background: the taxonomic status of the brown dog tick rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu stricto) is a subject of ongoing debate; there is a consensus that populations of this tick species should be referred to as r. sanguineus (sensu lato) until its taxonomic status is resolved. recent genetic studies revealed the existence of more than one lineage of r. sanguineus (s.l.) in temperate countries. in this study, we assessed the genetic identity of ticks collected from rural dogs living in several areas located in all major geographical regions of portugal. methods: a total of 347 ticks were collected from rural dogs living in different regions of portugal. these ticks were morphologically identified and partial mitochondrial 16s rrna gene sequences (similar to 300 bp) were obtained from representative specimens. results: the ticks were morphologically identified as ixodes ricinus (seven males and 27 females), rhipicephalus bursa (one male), rhipicephalus pusillus (one female) and r. sanguineus (s.l.) (two larvae, 101 nymphs, 108 males and 100 females). partial mitochondrial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained from 58 r. sanguineus (s.l.) specimens, and all of them were genetically identified as belonging to the so-called temperate lineage of r. sanguineus (s.l.) conclusions: these results strongly suggest that the temperate species of r. sanguineus (s.l.) is the only representative of this tick group found on dogs in portugal. it also adds weight to the hypothesis that rhipicephalus turanicus is not present in this country, although further investigations are necessary to confirm this.
fluid_mechanics	slotted liners are flow control devices widely used in both injection and production wells for thermal oil sands recovery operations such as steam-assisted gravity drainage. in these devices, slots are cut into the well at regular intervals around and along the well. the dimensions tend to be from fractions to several millimeters in gap and a few to about twenty centimeters long along the pipe. the key benefits offered by slotted liners are that they are among the most economical solutions for sand control and well bore stability as well as manufacturing. slotted liners have several design parameters including the slot density, pattern, slot opening size and shape that must be chosen to provide optimum inflow and outflow performance in the reservoir. due to the complexity in deriving these parameters analytically or experimentally, we have examined the impact of design parameters on steam injection by using a realizable k-epsilon turbulence computational fluid dynamic model of a 5 m slotted liner section coupled to a reservoir flow domain outside of the well governed by a modified darcy 's law that accounts for inertial effects. the results reveal that slot open area affects the flow distribution in the reservoir. the role of drive forces changes through the flow with viscous and pressure forces dominant in the slot and upstream area an(d) inertial forces just downstream of the slot and pressure and viscous forces in the reservoir.

molecular_biology	protein-protein interactions are fundamental for virtually all functions of the cell. a large fraction of these interactions involve short peptide motifs, and there has been increased interest in targeting them using peptide-based therapeutics. peptides benefit from being specific, relatively safe, and easy to produce. they are also easy to modify using chemical synthesis and molecular biology techniques. however, significant challenges remain regarding the use of peptides as therapeutic agents. identification of peptide motifs is difficult, and peptides typically display low cell permeability and sensitivity to enzymatic degradation. in this review, we outline the principal highthroughput methodologies for motif discovery and describe current methods for overcoming pharmacokinetic and bioavailability limitations.
human_metabolism	aims/hypothesis: we investigated the effects of rosiglitazone on nefa and triglyceride metabolism in type 2 diabetes. methods: in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of rosiglitazone in diet-treated type 2 diabetic subjects, we measured arteriovenous differences and tissue blood flow in forearm muscle and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, used stable isotope techniques, and analysed gene expression. responses to a mixed meal containing [ 1,1,1- c-13] tripalmitin were assessed. results: rosiglitazone induced insulin sensitisation without altering fasting nefa concentrations (- 6.6%, p= 0.16). postprandial nefa concentrations were lowered by rosiglitazone compared with placebo (- 21%, p= 0.04). adipose tissue nefa release was not decreased in the fasting state by rosiglitazone treatment (+ 24%, p= 0.17) and was associated with an increased fasting hormone-sensitive lipase rate of action (+ 118%, p= 0.01). postprandial triglyceride concentrations were decreased by rosiglitazone treatment (- 26%, p< 0.01) despite unchanged fasting concentrations. rosiglitazone did not change concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants. adipose tissue blood flow increased with rosiglitazone (+ 32%, p= 0.03). postprandial triglyceride [c-13] palmitic acid concentrations were unchanged, whilst nefa [c-13] palmitic acid concentrations were decreased (p= 0.04). in muscle, hexokinase ii mrna expression was increased by rosiglitazone (+ 166%, p= 0.001) whilst the expression of genes involved in insulin signalling was unchanged. adipose tissue expression of fabp4, lpl and fat/cd36 was increased. conclusions/interpretation: rosiglitazone decreases postprandial nefa and triglyceride concentrations. this may represent decreased spillover of nefas from adipose tissue depots. decreased delivery of nefas to the liver may lead to lowered postprandial triglyceride concentrations. upregulation of hexokinase ii expression in muscle may contribute to insulin sensitisation by rosiglitazone.
genetics	despite extensive genetics and breeding research, effective control of leaf rust caused by puccinia triticina eriks. and an important foliar disease of wheat, has not been achieved. this is mainly due to the widespread use of race-specific seedling resistance genes, which are rapidly overcome by new virulent races. there is increased emphasis now on the use of race-nonspecific adult plant resistance (apr) genes for durable control of leaf rust. the objective of this study was the evaluation of aegilops tauschii coss. (the d-genome donor of bread wheat) for apr, previously known to be a rich source of seedling resistance genes to leaf rust. a geographically diverse collection of a. tauschii maintained by the wheat genetics resource center was evaluated for apr in the field with a leaf rust composite culture of predominant races. out of a total of 371 a. tauschii accessions, 50 with low to moderate levels of disease severity were subsequently tested at the seedling stage in the greenhouse with four races and one composite culture of leaf rust. nine accessions displayed moderate resistance to one or more races of leaf rust at the seedling stage. the remaining 41 seedling-susceptible accessions are potential sources of new apr genes. accessions from afghanistan only displayed apr whereas both seedling resistance and apr were common in the caspian sea region (iran and azerbaijan). the apr in these newly identified a. tauschii accessions will be further characterized for novelty, effectiveness, and race-specificity.
cell_biology	brucella species are facultative intracellular pathogens that infect animals as their natural hosts. transmission to humans is most commonly caused by direct contact with infected animals or by ingestion of contaminated food and can lead to severe chronic infections. brucella can invade professional and non-professional phagocytic cells and replicates within endoplasmic reticulum (er)-derived vacuoles. the host factors required for brucella entry into host cells, avoidance of lysosomal degradation, and replication in the er-like compartment remain largely unknown. here we describe two assays to identify host factors involved in brucella entry and replication in hela cells. the protocols describe the use of rna interference, while alternative screening methods could be applied. the assays are based on the detection of fluorescently labeled bacteria in fluorescently labeled host cells using automated wide-field microscopy. the fluorescent images are analyzed using a standardized image analysis pipeline in cellprofiler which allows single cell-based infection scoring. in the endpoint assay, intracellular replication is measured two days after infection. this allows bacteria to traffic to their replicative niche where proliferation is initiated around 12 hr after bacterial entry. brucella which have successfully established an intracellular niche will thus have strongly proliferated inside host cells. since intracellular bacteria will greatly outnumber individual extracellular or intracellular non-replicative bacteria, a strain constitutively expressing gfp can be used. the strong gfp signal is then used to identify infected cells. in contrast, for the entry assay it is essential to differentiate between intracellular and extracellular bacteria. here, a strain encoding for a tetracycline-inducible gfp is used. induction of gfp with simultaneous inactivation of extracellular bacteria by gentamicin enables the differentiation between intracellular and extracellular bacteria based on the gfp signal, with only intracellular bacteria being able to express gfp. this allows the robust detection of single intracellular bacteria before intracellular proliferation is initiated.
molecular_biology	background: appendiceal cancers are rare and consist of carcinoid, mucocele, pseudomyxoma peritonei (pmp), goblet cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma histologies. current treatment involves surgical resection or debulking, but no standard exists for adjuvant chemotherapy or treatment for metastatic disease. methods: samples were identified from approximately 60,000 global tumors analyzed at a referral molecular profiling clia-certified laboratory. a total of 588 samples with appendix primary tumor sites were identified (male/female ratio of 2: 3; mean age =55). sixty-two percent of samples were adenocarcinomas (used for analysis); the rest consisted of 9% goblet cell, 15% mucinous; 6% pseudomyxoma, and less than 5% carcinoids and 2% neuroendocrine. tests included sequencing [sanger, next generation sequencing (ngs)], protein expression/ immunohistochemistry (ihc), and gene amplification [fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) or cish]. results: profiling across all appendiceal cancer histological subtypes for ihc revealed: 97% brcp, 81% mrp1, 81% cox-2, 71% mgmt, 56% topo1, 5% pten, 52% egfr, 40% ercc1, 38% sparc, 35% pdgfr, 35% topo2a, 25% rrm1, 21% ts, 16% ckit, and 12% for tle3. ngs revealed mutations in the following genes: 50.4% kras, 21.9% p53, 17.6% gnas, 16.5% smad4, 10% apc, 7.5% atm, 5.5% pik3ca, 5.0% fbxw7, and 1.8% braf. conclusions: appendiceal cancers show considerable heterogeneity with high levels of drug resistance proteins (bcrp and mrp1), which highlight the difficulty in treating these tumors and suggest an individualized approach to treatment. the incidence of low ts (79%) could be used as a backbone of therapy (using inhibitors such as 5fu/capecitabine or newer agents). therapeutic options includetopo1 inhibitors (irinotecan/topotecan), egfr inhibitors (erlotinib, cetuximab), pdgfr antagonists (regorafenib, axitinib), mgmt (temozolomide). clinical trials targeting pathways involving kras, p53, gnas, smad4, apc, atm, pik3ca, fbxw7, and braf may be also considered. overall, appendiceal cancers have similar patterns in their molecular profile to pancreatic cancers (can we say this, any statistical analysis done?) and have differential expression from colorectal cancers. these findings indicate the need to evaluate patient samples for patterns in marker expression and alteration, in order to better understand the molecular biology and formulate a personalized therapy approach in these difficult to treat cancers (supported by a grant from caris life sciences).
genetics	background: substance use and misuse and suicidal thoughts and behaviors tend to co-occur. the purpose of this study was to examine whether (a) suicidal ideation and attempt are related to onset of alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use and dependence; (b) early use of alcohol, nicotine and cannabis is associated with onset of suicidal ideation and attempt; and (c) whether these associations persist while controlling for covariates, such as family history of alcohol problems, major depression and other internalizing and externalizing disorders. methods: the prospective cohort of the collaborative study of the genetics of alcoholism (coga; n=3277) was used. cross-sectional and discrete time logistic regression (i.e. survival) analyses examined associations between suicidal ideation and attempt and onset of alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use and dependence. survival models also examined whether individual early substance use was related to onset of ideation and attempt. results: ideation was related to 0.71-0.77 odds of onset of subsequent alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use. attempt was associated with 1.44-1.61 odds of later alcohol, nicotine and cannabis dependence, even after accounting for covariates. evidence for early substance use being related to subsequent onset of ideation or attempt was limited. several sex and race differences emerged. limitations: the sample was ascertained for family history of alcoholism; not all participants had been followed up allowing for censored observations; reporting bias. conclusion: suicide attempts are associated with increased likelihood of onset of substance dependence.
genetics	environmental dna (edna) comprises dna fragments that have been shed into the environment by organisms, and which can be extracted from environmental samples such as water or soil. characterization of edna can allow researchers to infer the presence or absence of species from a particular site without the need to locate and identify individuals, and therefore may provide an extremely valuable tool for quantifying biodiversity. however, as is often the case with relatively new protocols, methodological challenges remain. a number of earlier reviews have discussed these challenges, but none have provided extensive treatment of the critical decisions surrounding molecular markers and primer development for use in edna assays. this review discusses a number of options and approaches that can be used when determining which primers and gene regions are most appropriate for either targeted species detection or metabarcoding macro-organisms from edna. the latter represents a new field that is growing rapidly, and which has the potential to revolutionize future assessments of community and ecosystem diversity.
genetics	michelia yunnanensis franch., is a traditional ornamental, aromatic, and medicinal shrub that endemic to yunnan province in southwest china. although the species has a large distribution pattern and is abundant in yunnan province, the populations are dramatically declining because of overexploitation and habitat destruction. studies on the genetic variation and demography of endemic species are necessary to develop effective conservation and management strategies. to generate such knowledge, we used 3 pairs of universal cpdna markers and 10 pairs of microsatellite markers to assess the genetic diversity, genetic structure, and demographic history of 7 m. yunnanensis populations. we calculated a total of 88 alleles for 10 polymorphic loci and 10 haplotypes for a combined 2,089 bp of cpdna. m. yunnanensis populations showed high genetic diversity (ho = 0.551 for nuclear markers and hd = 0.471 for cpdna markers) and low genetic differentiation (f-st = 0.058). geographical structure was not found among m. yunnanensis populations. genetic distance and geographic distance were not correlated (p >0.05), which indicated that geographic isolation is not the primary cause of the low genetic differentiation of m. yunnanensis. additionally, m. yunnanensis populations contracted similar to 20,000-30,000 years ago, and no recent expansion occurred in current populations. results indicated that the high genetic diversity of the species and within its populations holds promise for effective genetic resource management and sustainable utilization. thus, we suggest that the conservation and management of m. yunnanensis should address exotic overexploitation and habitat destruction.
northern_blotting	background and objectives: calprotectin, a heterodimer of s100a8 and s100a9 with antimicrobial properties, is expressed in gingival keratinocytes and plays an important role in innate immunity. because calprotectin expression is localized in the spinous cell layer of the gingival epithelium, we hypothesized that the expression of calprotectin in keratinocytes is related to the differentiation stage. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between calprotectin expression and keratinocyte differentiation using some factors that regulated its differentiation. material and methods: normal human gingival keratinocytes were isolated from gingival tissues obtained at the extraction of wisdom teeth, and were cultured in serum-free keratinocyte medium supplemented with interleukin-1 alpha or calcium, which promote keratinocyte differentiation, and transforming frowth factor-beta (tgf-beta) or retinoic acid, which suppress its differentiation. the expression of s100a8/a9 mrna and the production of calprotectin in normal human gingival keratinocytes were examined by northern blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. the expression of cytokeratin 14, involucrin and filaggrin (marker proteins of keratinocyte differentiation) was investigated by immunohistochemical staining, and the dna-binding activity of ccaat/enhancer binding protein alpha (c/ebp alpha), a transcription factor, was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. results: the expression of s100a8/a9 mrna and the production of calprotectin were increased by interleukin-1 alpha and calcium, but decreased by tgf-beta. ra inhibited the expression of s100a8/a9 and keratinocyte differentiation, which were induced by interleukin-1 alpha. c/ebp alpha dna-binding activity in normal human gingival keratinocytes was enhanced by interleukin-1 alpha and calcium, but suppressed by tgf-beta. conclusion: the present study suggests that calprotectin expression is related to keratinocyte differentiation and that c/ebp alpha is a regulator of calprotectin expression in keratinocytes.
immunology	middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus (mers-cov) is transmitted via the respiratory tract and causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome by infecting lung epithelial cells and macrophages. macrophages can readily recognize the virus and eliminate it. mers-cov infects cells via its spike (s) glycoprotein that binds on dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (dpp4) receptor present on macrophages. whether this spike/dpp4 association affects macrophage responses remains unknown. herein we demonstrated that infection of macrophages with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with mers-cov s glycoprotein results in suppression of macrophage responses since it reduced the capacity of macrophages to produce tnfa and il-6 in naive and lps-activated thp-1 macrophages and augmented lps-induced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine il-10. mers-cov s glycoprotein induced the expression of the negative regulator of tlr signaling irak-m as well as of the transcriptional repressor ppar gamma. inhibition of dpp4 by its inhibitor sitagliptin or sirna abrogated the effects of mers-cov s glycoprotein on irak-m, ppar gamma and il-10, confirming that its immunosuppressive effects were mediated by dpp4 receptor. the effect was observed both in thp-1 macrophages and human primary peripheral blood monocytes. these findings support a dpp4-mediated suppressive action of mers-cov in macrophages and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogenicity.
enzymology	the microtubule (mt) cytoskeleton supports a broad range of cellular functions, from providing tracks for intracellular transport, to supporting movement of cilia and flagella, to segregating chromosomes in mitosis. these functions are facilitated by the organizational and dynamic plasticity of mt networks. an important class of enzymes that alters mt dynamics is the depolymerizing kinesin-like proteins, which use their catalytic activities to regulate mt end dynamics. in this review, we discuss four topics surrounding these mt-depolymerizing kinesins. we provide a historical overview of studies focused on these motors and discuss their phylogeny. in the second half, we discuss their enzymology and biophysics and give an overview of their known cellular functions. this discussion highlights the fact that mt-depolymerizing kinesins exhibit a diverse range of design principles, which in turn increases their functional versatility in cells.
internal_combustion_engine	the methanol fuel used in diesel engine can reduce the emissions effectively, while the performance of engine keeps unchanged or even improved, the study of methanol used in diesel engine is paid more and more attention. experiments were conducted in a 4-cylinder, turbocharged direct injection diesel engine fueled with diesel/methanol dual fuel (dmdf). in the experiment, methanol was injected into inlet duct by two low-pressure injectors, and directly mixed with intake air before entering the engine. the diesel fuel was directly injected in cylinder. the methanol substitution percent (msp), intake air temperature and engine speed were changed to investigate the unevenness degree (ued) cylinder-to-cylinder. the experimental results show that the ued of engine increases with the increase of msp under various engine loads, the covpp increases with msp under low engine load, and the covpp curves vary very little under low msp under 75% and 100% engine load, but a significantly rise appeared when msp further increases. the ued gradually increases with the increase of intake air temperature, and it is usually less than 8% when intake air temperatures lower than 80 degrees c under 40% msp. it suggests it is helpful to decrease the ued when the intake air temperature is in the range of 35-80 degrees c as msp less than 40%. in addition, the difference of pressure between cylinder-to-cylinder decreases with the increase of engine speed, it can be considered raising msp at high engine speed in order to gain better engine economy.

northern_blotting	objective: to determine the role of dkkl1 in mouse development, viability, and fertility. design: prospective experimental study. setting: government research institution. animal(s): mice of c57bl/6. b6d2f1/j, and 129x1/svj strains, as well as transgenic mice of mixed c57bl/6 and 129x1/svj strains were used for the studies. intervention(s): expression of the dkkl1 gene was characterized during early mouse development, and the effects of dkkl1 ablation on reproduction and fertility were characterized in vitro and in vivo. main outcome measure(s): dkkl1 rna expression was determined by northern blotting hybridization as well as quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays. in vitro fertilization assays were used to assess fertility of sperm from male mice lacking functional dkkl1. result(s): dkkl1 is a gene unique to mammals that is expressed primarily in developing spermatocytes and its product localized in the acrosome of mature sperm. here we show that dkkl1 also is expressed in the trophectoderm/placental lineage. surprisingly, embryos lacking dkkl1 protein developed into viable, fertile adults. nevertheless, the ability of sperm that lacked dkkl1 protein to fertilize wild-type eggs was severely compromised in vitro. because this defect could be overcome either by removal of the zona pellucida or by the presence of wild-type sperm. dkkl1, either directly or indirectly, facilitates the ability of sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida. penetration of the zona pellucida by dkkl1 sperm was delayed in vivo as well as in vitro, but the delay in vivo was compensated by other factors during preimplantation development. accordingly, dkkl1 i males offer an in vitro fertilization model for identifying factors that may contribute to infertility. conclusion(s): dkkl1 is a mammalian-specific, acrosomal protein that strongly affects in vitro fertilization, although the effect is attenuated in vivo.

polymerase_chain_reaction	natural killer (nk) cell activity is regulated by activating and inhibitory signals transduced by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kir). diversity in kir gene repertoire among individuals may affect disease outcome. sepsis development and severity may be influenced by genetic factors affecting the immune response. here, we examined sixteen kir genes and their human leucocyte antigen (hla) class i ligands in critical patients, aiming to identify patterns that could be associated with sepsis. male and female patients (ages ranging between 14 and 94 years-old) were included. dna samples from 211 patients with sepsis and 60 controls (critical care patients with no sepsis) collected between 2004 and 2010 were included and genotyped for kir genes using the polymerase chain reaction method with sequence-specific oligonucleotide (pcr-sso), and for hla genes using the polymerase chain reaction method with sequence-specific primers (pcr-ssp). the frequencies of activating kir2ds1 and kir3ds1 in sepsis patients when compared to controls were 41.23% versus 55.00% and 36.49% versus 51.67% (p = 0.077 and 0.037 respectively before bonferroni correction). these results indicate that activating kir genes 2ds1 and 3ds1 may more prevalent in critical patients without sepsis than in patients with sepsis, suggesting a potential protective role of activating kir genes in sepsis.

thermodynamics	involvement of suprafacial and intrafacial oxygen species in catalytic combustion of methane over the (100) faceted cobalt spinel was systematically examined as a function of temperature and ch4 conversion (x-ch4). the clear-cut co3o4 nanocubes of uniform size were synthesized using a hydrothermal method and characterized with xrd, rs, hr-tem, xrf, tpsr (ch4/o-16/18(2)), and ssitka (ch4/o-16/18(2)) techniques. the experimental results were corroborated by first-principles thermodynamic and dft+u molecular modeling, providing a rational framework for a detailed understanding of the origin of a different redox comportment of the catalyst with the varying temperature and its mechanistic implications. three temperature/conversion stages of the methane oxidation reaction were distinguished, depending on involvement of the adsorbed or lattice oxygen and the redox state of the catalyst. a stoichiometric (100) surface region (300 degrees c < t < 450 degrees c, x-ch4 < 25%) is featured by the dominant suprafacial (langmuir-hinshelwood) mechanism of methane oxidation. a region of slightly defected surface (450 degrees c < t < 650 degrees c, 25%80%), the oxygen vacancies are only partially refilled, the catalyst is significantly reduced, and methane is combusted according to the mars van krevelen scheme. molecular modeling revealed that the suprafacial co-o-ads adoxygen species are more active (delta e-a = 0.83 ev) than the intrafacial co-o-surf surface sites (delta e-a = 1.11 ev) in the ch4 oxidation. the (100) surface state diagrams for the three distinguished conversion regions were constructed to elucidate the catalyst thermodynamic behavior under those conditions. it was shown that the activity of cobalt spinel is maintained by redox autotuning of the catalyst and dynamic adjustment of uneven participation of the suprafacial and intrafacial oxygen species in methane oxidation to the actual reaction conditions. these factors have important structural and mechanistic consequences for the catalytic ch4 combustion on cobalt spinel and related systems, controlling not only the sustainable versus the stoichiometric turnovers but also for the prevalence or coexistence of the langinuir-hinshelwood and the mars van krevelen mechanisms with the reaction progress.
molecular_biology	the process of curing a patient by removing his illness by extracting blood is a very old one. many years ago, phlebotomy was practiced to cure illness. now, this old process, placed on a rational basis with therapeutic apheresis (ta), is being followed in clinical practice. therapeutic plasma exchange (tpe) with hollow fiber modules has been used in different severe diseases for more than 40 years. based on many years of experience with the extracorporeal circulation in end-stage renal disease, the authors herein give an overview of ta in immunological diseases, especially in hematologic, autoimmune and dermatologic diseases. updated information on immunology and molecular biology of different immunological diseases is discussed in relation to the rationale for apheresis therapy and its place in combination with other modern therapies. with the introduction of novel and effective biologic agents, ta is indicated only in severe cases, such as in rapid progression despite immunosuppressive therapy and/or biologic agents. in mild forms of autoimmune disease, treatment with immunosuppressive therapies and/or biologic agents seems to be sufficient. the prognosis of autoimmune diseases with varying organ manifestations has improved in recent years, due in part to very aggressive therapy schemes. for the immunological diseases that can be treated with ta, the guidelines of the german working group of clinical nephrology and of the apheresis applications committee of the american society for apheresis are cited. ta has been shown to effectively remove the autoantibodies from blood and lead to rapid clinical improvement.
human_metabolism	this review is focused on creatine (cr) (methyl guanidine acetic acid) and its application in the form of a dietary supplement. it has been especially utilized by athletes, but its pronounced therapeutic potential is also discussed in the present article. it is supposed that human body uses cr for the formation of creatine phosphate (pcr), which is necessary for muscular work as a source of energy. the effects of supplemented cr on dynamics of methionine cycle and other related metabolic pathways have not been fully explained yet. the review is focused on the description of affects caused by its application on human body and metabolism. already the application of small amounts of cr rapidly increases levels of thiodiglycolic acid (tdga) in urine after its supplementation, which phenomenon can serve as a sensitive marker of disturbance in metabolic pathways of 2c units and of thiolic compounds. strong differences between initial and terminal tdga levels in urine indicate that cr disturbed the equilibria of redox processes, catalyzed by folates and vitamin b-12. some theories for explanation of these effects are described in this manuscript. nevertheless, similarly as in other metabolic studies, the results are significantly affected by the probands' individual responses, which reflect their individual genetic makeup. the various methods such as voltammetric (generally electrochemical), chromatographic, mass spectrometric, enzymatic etc., which have been most frequently utilized for determination of discussed compounds in common laboratories, have been reported.
fluid_mechanics	the analysis of the penalized stokes problem, in its variable viscosity formulation, coupled to convection-diffusion equations is presented in this article. it models the interaction between a highly viscous fluid with variable viscosity and immersed moving and deformable obstacles. indeed, while it is quite common to couple poisson equations to diffusion-transport equations in plasma physics or fluid dynamics in vorticity formulations, the study of complex fluids requires to consider together the stokes problem in complex moving geometry and convection-diffusion equations. the main result of this paper shows the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to this equations system with regularity estimates. then we show that the solution to the penalized problem weakly converges toward the solution to the physical problem. numerical simulations of fluid mechanics computations in this context are also presented in order to illustrate the practical aspects of such models: lung cells and their surrounding heterogeneous fluid, and porous media flows. among the main original aspects in the present study, one can highlight the non linear dynamics induced by the coupling, and the tracking of the time-dependence of the domain.
manufacturing_engineering	in manufacturing engineering, localization accuracy is a key concern in the design of a fixture to specify a locating scheme and tolerance allocation. this paper presents a general analysis methodology that is able to characterize the effects of localization source errors based on the position and orientation of the workpiece. from this methodology, a fixture model is formulated by taking into account the overall errors among the system consisting of the workpiece and the fixture in the design of the fixture locating scheme. with this model, the locating principle and a criterion of the robust optimal design are then proposed to improve the localization quality of the fixture. some examples are provided and allow for a detailed discussion about how to carry out the optimal design of the locating scheme. a comparative study is also made between the optimal solution and the empirical one. finally, an experiment is made to validate the fixture locating scheme for a cylindrical workpiece. we conclude that this robust design method effectively achieves stable machining precision in workpieces.
cell_biology	the field of stem cell biology, cell therapy, and regenerative medicine has expanded almost exponentially, in the last decade. clinical trials are evaluating the potential therapeutic use of stem cells in many adult and pediatric lung diseases with vascular component, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), or pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). extensive research activity is exploring the lung resident and circulating progenitor cells and their contribution to vascular complications of chronic lung diseases, and researchers hope to use resident or circulating stem/progenitor cells to treat chronic lung diseases and their vascular complications. it is becoming more and more clear that progress in mechanobiology will help to understand the various influences of physical forces and extracellular matrix composition on the phenotype and features of the progenitor cells and stem cells. the current review provides an overview of current concepts in the field.
machine_design	in this paper, a novel motor topology (lateral stator machine) is proposed for various drilling applications where the space in the tool head is limited. the stator of the motor grows in one lateral direction, allowing for a compact direct drive design. finite-element analysis (fea) is carried out and the machine design is optimized for the specifications of a high-speed micro-machining spindle which is given as an example. the design procedure for those specifications is described in detail, where the torque is maximized while considering the space limitations and the loss constraints at the critical operating points. the construction of a lateral stator machine merged into a test bench is also described. the test bench is used for measuring the standstill torque of the machine in a configuration without bearings, such that only the electromagnetic torque is measured without any friction effects from the bearings. moreover, the test bench can be modified to measure the no-load losses and separate the mechanical and electromagnetic components of it. although described on a lateral stator machine, the measurement methodology of this paper can be applied to any electrical machine. finally, measurement results are given and the design procedure is verified.
molecular_biology	research on fungal pathogens with the aim to identify virulence determinants strictly relies on the generation of defined, recombinant strains, a task that is executed by means of a sophisticated molecular biology toolbox. recent developments in fungal genome engineering have opened a new frontier by implementing the crispr-cas9 technology, based on expression of the cas9 endonuclease that is loaded by a single guiding rna (sgrna) molecule to target a defined site in the recipient genome. this novel approach has been adapted successfully to engineer fungal genomes, among them the one of the human-pathogenic mould aspergillus fumigatus. implementation of the required components was achieved by various means that differ with respect to expression of the cas9 enzyme and sgrna delivery. validation of crispr-cas9-mediated mutagenesis could be executed by targeting selected candidate genes of a. fumigatus to provide a promising perspective for screening and multiplexing approaches to scrutinize the virulome of this opportunistic fungal pathogen in a comprehensive manner, such as by analyzing genetic polymorphisms or the function of gene families.
molecular_biology	background: hepatitis b virus (hbv) as an infectious disease that has nine genotypes (a-i) and a 'putative' genotype j. objectives: the aim of this study was to identify the rare codon clusters (rcc) in the hbv genome and to evaluate these rccs in the hbv proteins structure. methods: for detection of protein family accession numbers (pfam) in hbv proteins, the uniprot database and pfam search tool were used. protein family accession numbers is a comprehensive and accurate collection of protein domains and families. it contains annotation of each family in the form of textual descriptions, links to other resources and literature references. genome projects have used p famex tensively for large-scale functional annotation of genomic data; pfam database is a large collection of protein families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments and hidden markov models (hmms). the pfam search tools are databases that identify pfam of proteins. these pfam ids were analyzed in sherlocc program and the location of rccs in hbv genome and proteins were detected and reported as translated embl nucleotide sequence data library (trembl) entries. the trembl is a computer-annotated supplement of swiss-prot that contains all the translations of european molecular biology laboratory (embl) nucleotide sequence entries not yet integrated in swiss-prot. furthermore, the structures of trembl entries proteins were studied in the pdb database and 3d structures of the hbv proteins and locations of rccs were visualized and studied using swiss pdb viewer software (r). results: the pfam search tool found nine protein families in three frames. results of pfams studies in the sherlocc program showed that this program has not identified rccs in the external core antigen (pf08290) and truncated hbeag gene (pf08290) of hbv. by contrast, the rccs were identified in gene of hepatitis core antigen (pf00906 and the residues 224-234 and 251-255), large envelope protein s (pf00695 and the residues 53-56 and 70-84), x protein (pf00739 and the residues 10-24, 29-83, 95-99. 122-129, 139-143), dna polymerase (viral) n-terminal domain (pf00242 and the residues 59-62, 214-217, 407-413) and protein p (pf00336 and the residues 225-228). in hbv genome, seven rccs were identified in the gene area of hepatitis core antigen, large envelope protein s anddnapolymerase, while protein structures of trembl entries sequences found in sherlocc program outputs were not complete. conclusions: based on the location of detected rccs in the structure of hbv proteins, it was found that these rccs may have a critical role in correct folding of hbv proteins and can be considered as drug targets. the results of this study provide new and deep perspectives about structure of hbv proteins for further researches and designing new drugs for treatment of hbv.
enzymology	lipase inhibitors are the main anti-obesity drugs prescribed these days, but the complexity of their mechanism of action is making it difficult to develop new molecules for this purpose. the efficacy of these drugs is known to depend closely on the physico-chemistry of the lipid-water interfaces involved and on the unconventional behavior of the lipases which are their target enzymes. the lipolysis reaction which occurs at an oil-water interface involves complex equilibria between adsorption-desorption processes, conformational changes and catalytic mechanisms. in this context, surfactants can induce significant changes in the partitioning of the enzyme and the inhibitor between the water phase and lipid-water interfaces. surfactants can be found at the oil-water interface where they compete with lipases for adsorption, but also in solution in the form of micellar aggregates and monomers that may interact with hydrophobic parts of lipases in solution. these various interactions, combined with the emulsification and dispersion of insoluble substrates and inhibitors, can either promote or decrease the activity and the inhibition of lipases. here, we review some examples of the various effects of surfactants on lipase structure, activity and inhibition, which show how complex the various equilibria involved in the lipolysis reaction tend to be.
machine_design	this paper explains the reason for the difference in maximum torque-speed characteristics and power factor of im between the motor and generator operation modes and investigates the influence of machine design parameters on the difference, such as stator resistance, rotor resistance and iron loss etc. an analytical mathematical model based on the dq reference frame is employed for investigation. it is shown that the difference in torque-speed characteristics between the motor and generator operation modes is mainly caused by the opposite direction of q-axis current and affected by stator and rotor resistance values. finally, analytically calculated torque-speed characteristics of a 12 kw im in the motor and generator operation modes are verified by finite element analyses.

hydraulics	this study presents a methodology for the estimation of a-priori parameters of the widely used kinematic wave approximation to the unsteady, 1-d saint-venant equations for hydrologic flow routing. the approach is based on a multi-dimensional statistical modeling of the macro scale spatial variability of rating curve parameters using a set of geophysical factors including geomorphology, hydro-climatology and land cover/land use over the conterminous united states. the main goal of this study was to enable prediction at ungauged locations through regionalization of model parameters. the results highlight the importance of regional and local geophysical factors in uniquely defining characteristics of each stream reach conforming to physical theory of fluvial hydraulics. the application of the estimates is demonstrated through a hydrologic modeling evaluation of a deterministic forecasting system performed on 1672 gauged basins and 47,563 events extracted from a 10-year simulation. considering the mean concentration time of the basins of the study and the target application on flash flood forecasting, the skill of the flow routing simulations is significantly high for peakflow and timing of peakflow estimation, and shows consistency as indicated by the large sample verification. the resulting a-priori estimates can be used in any hydrologic model that employs the kinematic wave model for flow routing. furthermore, probabilistic estimates of kinematic wave parameters are enabled based on uncertainty information that is generated during the multi-dimensional statistical modeling. more importantly, the methodology presented in this study enables the estimation of the kinematic wave model parameters anywhere over the globe, thus allowing flood modeling in ungauged basins at regional to global scales.

molecular_biology	context: marine cyanobacteria offer a robust resource for natural products drug discovery due to the secondary metabolites they produce.objective: to identify novel cyanobacterial compounds that exhibit cns psychoactive effects.materials and methods: cyanobacteria were collected from las perlas archipelago, panama and subjected to dichloromethane/methanol extraction and fractionation by column chromatography before being screened for affinity against a panel of cns targets. a 50:50 ethyl acetate:methanol fraction of one cyanobacterial extract (2064h) was subjected to hplc and the major peak was isolated (2064h3). at a dose of 20g per animal, 2064h and 2064h3 were tested in mice using behavioral assays that included the forced swim, open field and formalin tests.results: 2064h was shown to bind to the serotonin 2c (5-ht2c) receptor, a known target for depression and pain treatment. 2064h showed 59.6% inhibition of binding of [h-3]-mesulergine with an ic50 value of 179ng/ml and did not show inhibition of binding greater than 45% with any other receptors tested. both 2064h and 2064h3 decreased immobility time in the first minute of the tail suspension test. 2064h increased time, distance and number of entries in the center region in the first half of the open field test. 2064h increased overall nocifensive behaviors in the formalin test.discussion and conclusion: overall, manipulating the 5-ht2c receptor with these receptor-specific ligands derived from cyanobacteria altered pain, depression and anxiety-like behaviors, illustrating the importance of this receptor in affective behaviors. these results demonstrate the potential of cyanobacteria as a source for cns active compounds.
computer-aided_design	selective laser melting (slm) process, an additive manufacturing (am) technology, has had a rapid growth in the biomedical and aerospace markets because of the ability to manufacture complex designs directly from computer-aided design (cad) using materials such as titanium and aluminum alloys. although this technology allows designers to fabricate geometries not achievable with conventional manufacturing, it has some restrictions. the paper presents the technological problems and restrictions resulting in the production of structures in aluminum alloy by slm. in particular, it analyzed the input file of the process, .stl file, and the dimensional limits of geometries with sharp edges as a simple parallelepiped with a square base since the understanding of the limitations can help the designer in the creation of new components. the creation of function-independent design rules, easily transferrable on individual part designs, could allow a wide industrial usage and a better knowledge of am technologies. the results presented in this paper showed that the choice of parameters of conversion from the cad model to .stl file could be a restriction for the software for preprocessing part but also affects the surface roughness. moreover, if a slm machine with a laser beam of 100 mu m is used, it is not possible to produce geometries with sharp edges with size base below 0.8 mm in an aluminum alloy.
genetics	adaptation produces hard or soft selective sweeps depending on the supply of adaptive genetic polymorphism. the evolution of pesticide resistance in parasites is a striking example of rapid adaptation that can shed light on selection processes. plasmopara viticola, which causes grapevine downy mildew, forms large populations, in which resistance has rapidly evolved due to excessive fungicide use. we investigated the pathways by which fungicide resistance has evolved in this plant pathogen, to determine whether hard or soft selective sweeps were involved. an analysis of nucleotide polymorphism in 108 field isolates from the bordeaux region revealed recurrent mutations of cytb and cesa3 conferring resistance to quinone outside inhibiting (qoi) and carboxylic acid amide (caa) fungicides, respectively. higher levels of genetic differentiation were observed for nucleotide positions involved in resistance than for neutral microsatellites, consistent with local adaptation of the pathogen to fungicide treatments. no hitchhiking was found between selected sites and neighbouring polymorphisms in cytb and cesa3, confirming multiple origins of resistance alleles. we assessed resistance costs, by evaluating the fitness of the 108 isolates through measurements of multiple quantitative pathogenicity traits under controlled conditions. no significant differences were found between sensitive and resistant isolates, suggesting that fitness costs may be absent or negligible. our results indicate that the rapid evolution of fungicide resistance in p. viticola has involved a soft sweep.
enzymology	the main focus of enzymology is on the enzyme rates, substrate structures, and reactivity, whereas the role of solvent dynamics in mediating the biological reaction is often left aside owing to its complex molecular behavior. we used integrated x-ray- and terahertz-based time-resolved spectroscopic tools to study protein-water dynamics during proteolysis of collagen-like substrates by a matrix metalloproteinase. we show equilibration of structural kinetic transitions in the millisecond timescale during degradation of the two model substrates collagen and gelatin, which have different supersecondary structure and flexibility. unexpectedly, the detected changes in collective enzyme-substrate-water-coupled motions persisted well beyond steady state for both substrates while displaying substrate-specific behaviors. molecular dynamics simulations further showed that a hydration funnel (i.e., a gradient in retardation of hydrogen bond (hb) dynamics toward the active site) is substrate-dependent, exhibiting a steeper gradient for the more complex enzyme-collagen system. the long-lasting changes in protein-water dynamics reflect a collection of local energetic equilibrium states specifically formed during substrate conversion. thus, the observed long-lasting water dynamics contribute to the net enzyme reactivity, impacting substrate binding, positional catalysis, and product release.
northern_blotting	fresh-cut papaya fruit undergo rapid tissue deterioration during storage. a comparative gene expression study was conducted to isolate genes differentially expressed upon fresh-cut processing by means of mrna differential display rt-pcr. differential display analysis was performed on intact and fresh-cut papaya fruit stored in parallel for 12h at 5 degrees c with three different one-base-anchored oligo dt and eight arbitrary primers. confirmation of true positive bands was performed by northern blotting. fourteen differentially expressed cdnas ranging from 154 to 777 bp were cloned, sequenced and compared to genbank sequences. the partial cdnas showed significant homologies to signaling pathway genes, membrane proteins, cell-wall enzymes, proteases, ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, and enzymes involved in plant defense responses. northern blot analysis with probes of each of the partial clones revealed that most of the genes corresponding to partial cdnas were expressed in a fresh-cut dependent manner during 8 days storage. the transcripts for pc18-5, pa19-3 and pc17 were not detectable on northern blots. the results suggest that fresh-cut processing induces the expression of proteins involved in membrane degradation, free radical generation, and enzymes involved in global stress responses.

human_metabolism	iodine is a biologically important trace element. its behaviour in the environment and in human metabolism is determined by the type of iodine species which takes part in chemical reactions. knowledge of their concentrations is necessary to understand and describe the iodine reaction paths. a separation procedure is proposed for quick determination of common forms of iodine-iodide, iodate ions, molecular iodine and organoiodine (in the form of ch3i). the procedure consists of sequential sorption by passing the sample solution first through a solid-phase extraction cartridge to separate i-2 and ch3i from io3- and i- then through an anion-exchange resin in a cartridge to retain the latter two species. each loaded cartridge is eluted to separate the sorbed pair of species. concentration determination of the resulting four solutions can be performed by standard methods, e.g. by spectrophotometry, tracer counting or with ion-selective electrodes.
genetics	this paper reveals that nearly 25 years after the national academy of sciences (nas), biological effects of ionizing radiation (beir) i committee (1972) used russell 's dose-rate data to support the adoption of the linear-no-threshold (lnt) dose response model for genetic and cancer risk assessment, russell acknowledged a significant under-reporting of the mutation rate of the historical control group. this error, which was unknown to beir i, had profound implications, leading it to incorrectly adopt the lnt model, which was a decision that profoundly changed the course of risk assessment for radiation and chemicals to the present.
molecular_biology	skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in our body, is responsible for generating the force required for movement, and is also an important thermogenic organ. skeletal muscle is an enigmatic tissue because while on the one hand, skeletal muscle regeneration after injury is arguably one of the best-studied stem cell-dependent regenerative processes, on the other hand, skeletal muscle is still subject to many degenerative disorders with few therapeutic options in the clinic. it is important to develop new regenerative medicine-based therapies for skeletal muscle. future therapeutic strategies should take advantage of rapidly developing technologies enabling the differentiation of skeletal muscle from human pluripotent stem cells, along with precise genome editing, which will go hand in hand with a steady and focused approach to understanding underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle development, regeneration, and disease. in this review, i focus on highlighting the recent advances that particularly have relied on developmental and molecular biology approaches to understanding muscle development and stem cell function. copyright (c) 2016 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
machine_design	a novel expert hydro/aero-static spindle design system strategy is presented in this paper. it is based on the comprehensive principles of machine design, machining dynamics and metal cutting mechanics. the transmission and lubrication types of the spindle are decided by a selection system, which utilize a dedicated logical choice algorithm in the light of the specifications of both workpiece material and desired cutting condition. hydro/aero-static spindles are designed by this system from its dynamics perspective. the chatter vibration of the spindle is automatically improved by optimizing the structural parameters of the spindle. meanwhile, the predicted frequency response function (frf) of the spindle based on the rotor dynamics is integrated to the chatter vibration stability law. consequently, the expert design system enables the structure of machine tools to be designed efficiently with a higher precision. the proposed system was demonstrated through an aerostatic spindle design for micro-array structures machining.

manufacturing_engineering	purpose - surface roughness is an important parameter in manufacturing engineering with significant influence on the performance of mechanical parts. failures, sometimes catastrophic failures, leading to high costs, have been imputed to a component 's surface roughness. owing to the need for improvement of machining parameters in order to obtain a prescribed surface roughness, new developments have been recently investigated. this work aims to report on a study of an optimisation model based on genetic algorithms (gas). design/methodology/approach - the developed algorithm considers a machining parameter data population obtained from experimental tests. the exchange of structured information based on natural selection principles and ""survival-of-the-fittest"" allows the combination of solutions in a sequence of generations leading to the best solution. findings - over standard experimental design methodologies the proposed ga approach shows advantages in finding the optimal conditions under the imposed constraints. indeed the quality of the produced surface roughness cannot be evaluated using only a criterion. this ga method determines the combined effects of the input parameters to the optimal machining parameter. originality/value - a new methodology for determining optimal machining parameters in dry turning based on the measurement of the surface roughness is proposed. the numerical and experimental developed model can be used with success on further applications with industrial interest.
human_metabolism	human liver microsomes (hlms) are used to simulate human xenobiotic metabolism in vitro. in forensic and clinical toxicology, hlms are popularly used to study the metabolism of new designer drugs for example. in this work, we present an automated online extraction system we developed for hlm experiments, which was compared to a classical offline approach. furthermore, we present studies on the metabolism of 11 cathinones; for eight of these, the metabolism has not previously been reported. metabolites were identified based on ms2 and ms3 scans. fifty-three substances encompassing various classes of drugs were employed to compare the established offline and the new online methods. the metabolism of each of the following 11 cathinones was studied using the new method: 3,4-methylenedioxy-n-benzylcathinone, benzedrone, butylone, dimethylcathinone, ethylone, flephedrone, methedrone, methylone, methylethylcathinone, naphyrone, and pentylone. the agreement between the offline and the online methods was good; a total of 158 metabolites were identified. using only the offline method, 156 (98.7%) metabolites were identified, while 151 (95.6%) were identified using only the online method. the metabolic pathways identified for the 11 cathinones included the reduction of the keto group, desalkylation, hydroxylation, and desmethylenation in cathinones containing a methylenedioxy moiety. our method provides a straightforward approach to identifying metabolites which can then be added to the library utilized by our clinical toxicological screening method. the performance of our method compares well with that of an established offline hlm procedure, but is as automated as possible.
southern_blotting	p>the t(14;18) translocation is the most distinguishing molecular finding in follicular lymphoma (fl). however, the reported frequencies of t(14;18) in fl show significant variation, which is often attributed to geographical and/or methodological factors. the methods used to detect t(14;18) include southern blotting, conventional cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and polymerized chain reaction (pcr). because of its practicality and superior sensitivity, pcr is becoming the more commonly used method in clinical laboratories. the identification of the main breakpoint regions on chromosome 18, including the major breakpoint region (mbr), the minor cluster region (mcr), and the newly defined intermediate cluster region (icr), increased the detection frequency of pcr. in our study, using a highly sensitive nested pcr strategy with primers for mbr, mcr and icr regions, we were able to detect t(14;18) in 95% of fl patients, which is one of the highest reported frequencies using pcr. we screened 58 fl patient samples collected retrospectively from different hospitals in jordan. dna was extracted from archival paraffin-embedded samples, some of which were >10 years old. the respective breakpoint distributions were, 47 for mbr (81%), two for mcr (3.5%) and six for icr (10.3%). in this report, we analyze this high frequency of t(14;18) detection in a general review of the recent literature, in an attempt to assess the geographical vs. methodological influences on the reported frequencies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	breast cancer is a disease of unknown etiology; however, the major risk factors are genetic alterations. studies have demonstrated an association between insulinlike growth factor 1 (igf-1) gene polymorphism and cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, in addition to its role in breast cancer growth and aggressiveness. two polymorphic variants of the igf-1 gene are highlighted in association with breast cancer, rs6220 and rs7136446, although controversy exists as to this relationship. the current study included 137 women (68 breast cancer cases and 69 controls without breast cancer) who had 3 ml of peripheral blood drawn for the study of genomic dna extracted from leukocytes using the genotyping technique by real-time polymerase chain reaction. the cc genotype (rs7136446) was present in 4 women (5.9%) from the case group and in 2 (3.0%) women from the control group (p = 0.67), while the gg genotype (rs6220) occurred in 8 (11.5%) women from the case group and in 5 (7.2%) women from the control group (p = 0.75). no statistically significant difference was observed between the cc genotype of variant rs7136446 in premenopausal case and control women (p = 0.31), thus as there was also no significant difference between case and control postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). concerning the gg genotype of rs6220, it occurred in 6 (14.2%) premenopausal case and 4 (8%) control women (p = 0.71) and no difference was found in postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). in the current study, igf-1 gene polymorphism of snp variants rs6220 and rs7136446 had no statistically significant association with breast cancer, both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
molecular_biology	somatic embryogenesis is an important biotechnological tool in breeding and conservation programmes for woody species. it exists an increasing interest in the improvement of somatic embryogenesis induction in commercial species such as pinus radiata. one approach to obtain markers of successful somatic embryogenesis can be the study of protein profiling in a descriptive study. in order to accomplish this objective, 2-d and maldi-tof/tof-ms analysis were used in the identification and quantification of proteins from pinus radiata d. don somatic embryos derived from 4 cell lines that were generated under different environmental conditions at initiation stage. based on the swiss-prot database, among the 139 proteins detected, 25 of them appeared only in those cell lines with low initiation percentage at the initial stage of somatic embryogenesis. only two proteins were detected differentially in cell lines with high initiation rates. approximately 60% of the proteins identified were related to carbohydrate metabolic process and defence response. this study gives new insights about the proteomics in forest trees, as well as provides clues on the underlying causes of the mechanisms governing pinus radiata somatic embryogenesis process, and can serve as a tool for facing the improvement ofthe breeding programmes.
genetics	age-related cataracts are frequently associated with degenerative changes in the ocular lens including the aggregation of proteins mainly crystallins, but also other proteins including amyloids (a beta) leading to the hypothesis that cataracts could be used as ""biomarkers"" for alzheimer disease. even if this hypothesis was rejected by david beebe 's last paper (bei et al., exp. eye res., 2015), it is a fascinating aspect to look for commonalities between eye diseases and neurological disorders. in this review, i discuss such commonalities between eye and brain mainly from a developmental point of view. the finding of the functional homology of the drosophila eyeless gene with the mammalian pax6 gene marks a first highlight in the developmental genetics of the eye this result destroyed the ""dogma"" of the different evolutionary routes of eye development in flies and mammals. the second highlight was the finding that pax6 is also involved in the development of the forebrain supporting the pleiotropic role of many genes. these findings opened a new avenue for research showing that a broad variety of transcription factors, but also structural proteins are involved both, in eye and brain development as well as into the maintenance of the functional integrity of the corresponding tissue(s). in this review recent findings are summarized demonstrating that genes whose mutations have been identified first to be causative for congenital or juvenile eye disorders are also involved in regenerative processes and neurogenesis (pax6), but also in neurodegenerative diseases like parkinson (e.g. pitx3) or in neurological disorders like schizophrenia (e.g. crybb1, crybb2).

thermodynamics	a new solar-biomass power generation system that integrates a two-stage gasifier is proposed in this paper. in this system, two different types of solar collectors, concentrating solar thermal energy at different temperature levels, are applied to drive solar-biomass thermochemical processes of pyrolysis (at about 643 k) and gasification (at about 1150 k) for production of solar fuel. the produced solar fuel, namely gasified syngas, is directly utilized by an advanced combined cycle system for power generation. numerical simulations are implemented to evaluate the on-design and off-design thermodynamic performances of the system. results indicate that the proposed system can achieve an overall energy efficiency of 27.93% and a net solar-to-electric efficiency of 19.89% under the nominal condition. the proposed two stage solar-biomass gasification routine exhibits improved system thermodynamic performance compared to that in one-stage gasification technical mode, and the provided heat resource is in a good match with the requirements for the biomass gasification procedure. under given simulation conditions in this paper, the energy level upgrade ratio in the proposed two-stage solar-biomass gasification system for the introduced solar thermal energy is as high as 32.35% compared to 21.62% in one-stage gasification mode. meanwhile, the daily average net solar-to-electric efficiency on the representative days reaches to the range of 8.88-19.04%, while that of 9.97-15.71% in one-stage model. the research findings provide a promising approach for efficient utilization of the abundant solar and biomass resources in western china and reduction of co2 emission.

immunology	chronic granulomatous disease is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency disorder that reduces the superoxide generation ability of phagocytes, leading to recurrent infections and granulomatous inflammation. we report the case of a previously healthy 3-year-old boy who presented with classic features of crohn disease. suspicion from histopathologiclogic assessment allowed early diagnosis and treatment for chronic granulomatous disease before the onset of infections.
manufacturing_engineering	kaizen refers to the philosophy or practices that focus upon continuous improvement of processes in manufacturing, engineering and business management. the improvements are usually accomplished at little or no expense and without sophisticated techniques. the purpose of this paper is to present the results of implementing the kaizen principles at port installed options center in toyota saudi arabia. using relevant kaizen tools including toyota production system (tps), 5s and the seven muda enabled us to understand the system and identify the most critical problem areas. the kaizen target was set after analyzing the problems and identifying the gap between the existing system and the tps. the main results of the study can be summarized as: using the same facilities it was possible to be more efficient by reducing the manpower needed by 26.9% (from 349 to 275 installers) and more effective by increasing the annual output by 13% (from 188000 to 212400 vehicles); improve the associates engagement index (q12) by 6.4% (from 2.91 to 3.11); potential for inventory reduction due to the use of kanban system with just-in-time production; avoid investing in new facilities needed to meet the increase in the demand in the market. all these resulted in improving the production line productivity which were appreciated and acknowledged by toyota motor corporation.
molecular_biology	environmental epigenetics is the study of how environmental signals affect gene expression. within this growing field of molecular biology, experiments on the epigenetic effects of 'maternal care' on offspring health have received much scientific and public attention and are often called upon to showcase how environmental epigenetics will create a new understanding of life as inherently 'biosocial.' while, on the one hand, this research is exciting and offers possible opportunities for collaboration between molecular biology and the social sciences, it is also necessary to consider its political dimensions. in this paper, we show how commonsense assumptions about sex, gender, sexuality, and class are present in the design, interpretation, and dissemination of experiments on the epigenetic effects of maternal care. as these experiments come to support claims about human motherhood through a dense speculative cross-traffic between epigenetic studies in rodents and psychological and epidemiological studies in humans, current research trends work to illustrate rather than interrogate existing stereotypes about maternal agency and responsibility. with this analysis, we offer a cautionary perspective regarding the potentials and challenges for new forms of collaborative biosocial knowledge practices emerging out of environmental epigenetics.
thermodynamics	the density measurements have been carried out for ternary aqueous solutions containing a fixed concentration (similar to 0.1 mol center dot kg(-1)) of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-cd) and varying concentrations (similar to 0.003 to similar to 0.21 mol center dot kg(-1)) of some local anesthetical drugs, namely procaine hydrochloride (pc center dot hc1), lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate (lc center dot hc1) and tetracaine hydrochloride (tc center dot hc1) at 298.15 k. the density data are used to determine apparent molar volumes of the drug molecules in ternary solutions at finite concentrations (phi(v)) as well at infinitely dilute solutions (phi(0)(v)). following the methods developed by hoiland et al. as well by jolicoeur et al. and using the infinite dilution volume values for the drugs in ternary and binary solutions and incorporating the equilibrium constant values for the complexation between alpha-cd and drugs, volume changes due to encapsulation or complexation have been estimated. it is observed that all the studied hydrochlorides exhibit high positive volume change due to complexation. the results are discussed in terms of host-guest interaction and structural specificity of guest molecules.

materials_engineering	we developed a software package that incorporates integrated computational materials engineering principles to enable rapid development of new state-of-the-art atomistic potentials for metal behavior driven by ab initio and experimental data. the software features hand-tuning abilities as well as automated calibration of parameters to flexible target properties. molecular statics simulations of target properties are done using a built-in lammps library module to boost performance. the potential calibration method is flexible and intuitive allowing users to quickly develop potentials for complex alloys capturing a wide variety of behaviors. we demonstrate the validity of the software and technique by calibrating a new robust mg potential.
computer-aided_design	the influence of the acuteness of the model angle and the direction of printing was investigated on different three-dimensional (3d) printers to understand the fidelity of 3d printing. a polyjet printer and two fused deposition modeling printers were used in the present study. computer-aided design (cad) models were designed in the form of a triangular prism with a height of 15 mm and with varying angles of 60a degrees, 45a degrees, 30a degrees, 20a degrees, 10a degrees, and 5a degrees. from the cad designs, additive manufacturing (am) models were printed in three different directions by each of the three printers. to investigate the global fidelity of the 3d printers, the height and surface outlines of the am model cross sections were measured. the fidelity of the am models with increasingly acute angles was not accurately reproduced when 3d printed, and the surface outlines of the am model cross sections were different in each direction of printing for each device. printing technology and printing direction need to be considered if accurate reproduction of acute angles in fine am structures in medical models is a necessity.
manufacturing_engineering	the context and problem of identifying and thereafter representing, analyzing and managing information and knowledge about an organization has always been very crucial to achieve business goals in an efficient and flexible way. particularly in a plm context, the issue of information overload is growing in importance. an emergent challenge consists in providing a context-driven access to federated information and knowledge and fostering cross-discipline collaborations between actors to improve quality in product development. this paper highlights key issues for knowledge definition and representation. we propose a bottom-up approach based on the user story mapping method (usm). this method is user-centric and leads to the definition of current and/or expected scenarios and processes along with a collaboratively agreed vision. common concepts and viewpoints are therefore derived and generalized through a process of merging defined roles, activities and usages sequences with a focus on the product content. this bottom-up approach provides a federated and common understanding of information throughout the industrial product and process lifecycle; which combined with appropriate tools and methods, such as questionnaires, standards specifications, knowledge based approaches, etc. results in the definition of the knowledge network and domain and therefore improves capabilities for sharing and reusing this knowledge in collaborative product development. the proposed approach is applied in the context of the fp7 european project linkeddesign (linked knowledge in manufacturing, engineering and design for next-generation production) based on three application scenarios.
immunology	objective: to describe the evolution of serological markers among hiv and hepatitis b coinfected patients, with emphasis on evaluating the reactivation or seroreversion of these markers. methods: the study population consisted of patients met in an aids outpatient clinic in sao paulo state, brazil. we included in the analysis all hiv-infected and who underwent at least two positive hepatitis b surface antigen serological testing during clinical follow up, with tests taken six months apart. patients were tested with commercial kits available for hepatitis b serological markers by microparticle enzyme immunoassay. clinical variables were collected: age, sex, cd4+ t-cell count, hiv viral load, alanine aminotransferase level, exposure to antiretroviral drugs including lamivudine and/or tenofovir. results: among 2,242 hiv positive patients, we identified 105 (4.7%) patients with chronic hepatitis b. follow up time for these patients varied from six months to 20.5 years. all patients underwent antiretroviral therapy during follow-up. among patients with chronic hepatitis b, 58% were hepatitis b ""e"" antigen positive at the first assessment. clearance of hepatitis b surface antigen occurred in 15% (16/105) of patients with chronic hepatitis b, and 50% (8/16) of these patients presented subsequent reactivation or seroreversion of hepatitis b surface antigen. among hepatitis b ""e"" antigen positive patients, 57% (35/61) presented clearance of this serologic marker. during clinical follow up, 28.5% (10/35) of those who initially cleared hepatitis b ""e"" antigen presented seroreversion or reactivation of this marker. conclusions: among hiv coinfected patients under antiretroviral therapy, changes of hbv serological markers were frequently observed. these results suggest that frequent monitoring of these serum markers should be recommended.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: gene polymorphisms are associated with sensitivity to platinum drugs. this study aimed to investigate the polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 locus and abcc2 rs717620 locus, and the sensitivity of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) to platinum drugs in a xinjiang uygur population. material/methods: the gene polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 and abcc2 rs717620 of uygur nsclc patients were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp). the relationship between the prognosis of advanced nsclc uygur patients and the gene polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 and abcc2 rs717620 was analyzed using progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) as the major outcome indicators. results: the median pfs of patients with advanced nsclc was 6.9 months and the os of uygur patients with advanced nsclc was 10.8 months. kaplan-meier survival analysis indicated that survival time of patients with gstp1 ag + gg was significantly longer than in patients with aa gene (p<0.05), and survival time of patients with abcc2 ct + tt was significantly longer than in patients with the cc gene (p<0.05). conclusions: polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 and abcc2 rs717620 can be used to predict the outcomes of uygur patients with advanced nsclc who have received platinum-based chemotherapy. additionally, this information could be used to guide the individualized treatment of uygur patients with advanced nsclc.
internal_combustion_engine	as a result of severe environmental pressure and stringent government regulations, refined energy management for vehicles has become inevitable. to improve vehicle fuel economy, this paper presents a bus-based energy management system for the electrical system of internal combustion engine vehicles. both the model of an intelligent alternator and the model of a lead-acid battery are discussed. according to these models, the energy management for a vehicular electrical system is formulated as a global optimal control problem which aims to minimize fuel consumption. pontryagin 's minimum principle is applied to solve the optimal control problem to realize a real-time control strategy for electrical energy management in vehicles. the control strategy can change the output of the intelligent alternator and the battery with the changes of electrical load and driving conditions in real-time. experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the traditional open-loop control strategy, the proposed control strategy for vehicle energy management can effectively reduce fuel consumption and the fuel consumption per 100 km is decreased by approximately 1.7%.
southern_blotting	silene latifolia is a dioecious plant with heteromorphic xy sex chromosomes. previous studies of sex chromosome-linked genes have suggested a gradual divergence between the x-linked and the y-linked genes in proportion to the distance from the pseudoautosomal region. however, such a comparison has yet to be made for the noncoding regions. to better characterize the nonrecombining region of the x and y chromosomes, we sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing the sex chromosome-linked paralogs slap3x and slap3y, including 115 kb and 73 kb of sequences, respectively, flanking these genes. the synonymous nucleotide divergence between slap3x and slap3y indicated that recombination stopped approximately 3.4 million years ago. sequence homology analysis revealed the presence of six long terminal repeat retrotransposon-like elements. using the nucleotide divergence calculated between left and right long terminal repeat sequences, insertion dates were estimated to be 0.083-1.6 million years ago, implying that all elements detected were inserted after recombination stopped. a reciprocal sequence homology search facilitated the identification of four homologous noncoding dna regions between the x and y chromosomes, spanning 6.7% and 10.6% of the x chromosome-derived and y chromosome-derived sequences, respectively, investigated. genomic southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the noncoding dna flanking slap3x/y has homology to many regions throughout the genome, regardless of whether they were homologous between the x and y chromosomes. this finding suggests that most noncoding dna regions rapidly lose their counterparts because of the introduction of transposable elements and indels (insertion-deletions) after recombination has stopped.
machine_design	this paper presents a novel multiphase permanent-magnet (pm) synchronous machinery series adopting two adjacent coils per phase and modular stator. machine design principles, including modular stator design, segmental interior pm-assisted rotor design, and winding factor improvement, are investigated. moreover, analytical modeling of winding inductance is developed to provide insights into the magnetic circuit of this type of machine. the proposed machinery series is suitable for wheel-driving electric vehicles attributing to their high magnetic isolation feature, good flux-weakening capability, and feasibility of modular fabrication.
strength_of_materials	there is evidence that when at least one spatial dimension of a material component is in the nanometer range, the effects of nanosize stress concentrators (nscs) such as impurities, inclusions, pores, and cracks are either eliminated or significantly reduced. the aim of the paper is to examine such evidence using atomistic simulation techniques for a crystalline metal and identify the critical dimensions below which the effects of nscs are minimal or even nonexistent. the preliminary results reported herein show that for cu single crystals subjected to constant external strain rate, such critical dimensions are larger than about 30 rim. since atomistic details are crucial in understanding material behavior at such scales, the paper points to the need for multiscale simulations techniques, presently being developed, for identifying critical dimensions and for examining slow strain rates. based on the results, the paper presents simulation-based explanations why nscs may be insignificant at nanoscales.

fluid_mechanics	turbine blade surfaces are cooled by jet flow from expanded exit holes (eehs) against the prevailing hot gas flow. the flow through eeh must be designed to form a film of cool air over the blade. computational analyses are performed to examine the cooling effectiveness of flow from eeh over the suction side of a blade by solving conservation equations and the ideal gas equation of state for turbulent and compressible flow. for a sufficiently high coolant mass flow rate, the flow through eeh, which acts as a converging-diverging nozzle, is choked at the nozzle throat, resulting in a supersonic flow, a shock, and then a subsonic flow downstream. the location of the shock relative to the high-temperature gas flow determines the temperature distribution along the blade surface; which is analyzed in detail when the following conditions are varied: coolant mass flow rate, the temperature difference between gas-and coolant-flow, eeh location on the blade surface, eeh inclination angle to the blade surface, and exit-to-inlet area ratio (ar) of eeh. the film cooling effectiveness is calculated along the surface of the blade. the results show (1) increasing the coolant flow rate improves the effectiveness, (2) change in temperature difference between the mainstream and the coolant slightly affects the effectiveness, (3) inclination angle of eeh has a pronounced effect on film cooling and the corresponding effectiveness, (4) both the location of the eeh on a blade and the ar of the eeh slightly change the effectiveness.
fluid_mechanics	by the homotopy renormalisation method, the global approximate solutions to falkner-skan equation and von karma 's problem of a rotating disk in an infinite viscous fluid are obtained. the homotopy renormalisation method is simple and powerful for finding global approximate solutions to nonlinear perturbed differential equations arising in mathematical physics.
human_metabolism	diclofenac (dcf) is a common anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical that is often detected in waste wasters, effluents and surface waters. recently, dcf was included in the watch list of substances in eu that requires its environmental monitoring in the member states. dcf is also known to harmfully affect several environmental species already at concentrations of150 d) favor the dcf elimination due to sludge adaptation. longer hrts (>2-3 d) could significantly increase the elimination of dcf during biological wastewater treatment. bioaugmentation could be used to enhance dcf elimination, however, this requires more research on microbial communities that are able to degrade dcf. also, further research is needed to gain more information about the deconjugation processes and biotic and abiotic transformation and the nature of transformation products.

southern_blotting	conserved domain such as nucleotide binding site (nbs) was found in several cloned plant disease resistance genes. based on the nbs domain, resistance gene analogues (rgas) have been isolated. a full-length cdna, spr1 was obtained by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) method. sequence analysis indicated that the length of spr1 was 3 066 bp, including a complete open reading frame of 2 667 bp encoding spr1 protein of 888 amino acids. compared with known nbs-lrr genes, it presented relatively high amino acid sequence identity. the polypeptide has a typical structure of nontir-nbs-lrr genes, with nb-arc, cc, and lrr domains. the spr1-related sequences belonged to multicopy gene family in sweetpotato genome according to the result of southern blotting. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed spr1 expressed in all tested tissues. the cloning of putative resistance gene from sweetpotato provides a basis for studying the structure and function of sweetpotato disease-resistance relating genes and disease resistant genetic breeding in sweetpotato. the gene has been submitted to the genbank database, and the accession number is ef428453.
human_metabolism	the mechanism of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs on the human organism is still not fully understood. new insights on the drugs' action can be provided by a metabolomics-driven approach, which offers a detailed view of the physiological state of an organism. here, we report a metabolome-wide association study with 295 metabolites in human serum from 1,762 participants of the kora f4 (cooperative health research in the region of augsburg) study population. our intent was to find variations of metabolite concentrations related to the intake of various drug classes and-based on the associations found-to generate new hypotheses about on-target as well as off-target effects of these drugs. in total, we found 41 significant associations for the drug classes investigated: for beta-blockers (11 associations), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (four assoc.), diuretics (seven assoc.), statins (ten assoc.), and fibrates (nine assoc.) the top hits were pyroglutamine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, pseudouridine, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, respectively. for beta-blockers we observed significant associations with metabolite concentrations that are indicative of drug side-effects, such as increased serotonin and decreased free fatty acid levels. intake of ace inhibitors and statins associated with metabolites that provide insight into the action of the drug itself on its target, such as an association of ace inhibitors with des-arg(9)-bradykinin and aspartylphenylalanine, a substrate and a product of the drug-inhibited ace. the intake of statins which reduce blood cholesterol levels, resulted in changes in the concentration of metabolites of the biosynthesis as well as of the degradation of cholesterol. fibrates showed the strongest association with 2-hydroxyisobutyrate which might be a breakdown product of fenofibrate and, thus, a possible marker for the degradation of this drug in the human organism. the analysis of diuretics showed a heterogeneous picture that is difficult to interpret. taken together, our results provide a basis for a deeper functional understanding of the action and side-effects of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs in the general population.
molecular_biology	engaging undergraduates in research is essential for teaching them to think like scientists, and it has become a desired component of classroom and laboratory instruction. research projects that span an entire semester expose students to a variety of concepts and techniques and allow students to use experiments to learn scientific principles, understand why specific techniques are applicable, critically analyze varied data, and examine how experimentation leads to acquiring knowledge. to provide an experience with these features, a semester long research project was integrated into a combined lecture and laboratory course, molecular biology. the project utilized the zebrafish model to examine gene expression during embryonic development and required students to develop and test hypotheses about the timing of expression of previously uncharacterized genes. the main goals for the project were to provide opportunities for students to develop critical thinking skills required for conducting research and to support the content goals of the course. to determine whether these goals were met, student performance on the steps of the project and related pre-test and post-test questions was examined.

southern_blotting	to date, lemna and spirodela species of the family lemnaceae are the only species that have been used to produce recombinant proteins for pharmaceutical and veterinary purposes. wolffia arrhiza is the most evolutionarily advanced species of the lemnaceae. a rootless duckweed, it is the most promising target for biopharmingas a candidate for submerged cultivation in a fermenter. as a first step toward future biotechnological use of wolffia, we established a stable transformation system for it based on agrobacterium-mediated transformation. following inoculation with the bacteria, wolffia cluster explants were cultured for 2 weeks on media containing 2.0 mg l(-1) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2.0 mg l(-1) n-6-benzyladenine. explants were then transferred to growth regulator-free media in the presence of 5.0 mg l(-1) hygromycin b to select antibiotic-resistant plants. other selective agents-kanamycin and phosphinothricin-were not suitable for wolffia, nor was application of particle bombardment for the delivery of foreign dna to wolffia explants. the developed agro transformation conditions yielded stably transformed lines of wolffia, confirmed by southern blotting, with an efficiency of 0.2-0.4 % transgenes per 100 explants.
northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are a new family of small rna molecules found in plants and animals. we developed a comprehensive strategy for identifying new mirna homologues by mining the repository of available citrus expressed sequence tags (ests). by adopting a range of filtering criteria, we identified a total of 38 potential mirnas - nine, five, nine and 15 mirnas in citrus trifoliata (ctr-mirnas), c. clementina (ccl-mirnas), c. reticulata (crt-mirnas) and c. sinensis (csi-mirnas), respectively - from more than 430,000 est sequences in citrus. using the potential mirna sequences, we conducted a further blast search of the mrna database and found six potential target genes in these citrus species. eight mirnas were selected in order to verify their existence in citrus using northern blotting, and the functions of several mirnas in mirna-mediated gene regulation are experimentally suggested. it appears that all these mirnas regulate expression of their target genes by cleavage, which is the most common situation in gene regulation mediated by plant mirnas. our achievement in identifying new mirnas in citrus provides a powerful incentive for further studies on the important roles of these mirnas.
enzymology	the unique light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (por) is an important model system for understanding how light energy can be harnessed to power enzyme reactions. the ultrafast photochemical processes, essential for capturing the excitation energy to drive the subsequent hydride-and proton-transfer chemistry, have so far proven difficult to detect. we have used a combination of time-resolved visible and ir spectroscopy, providing complete temporal resolution over the picosecond-microsecond time range, to propose a new mechanism for the photochemistry. excited-state interactions between active site residues and a carboxyl group on the pchlide molecule result in a polarized and highly reactive double bond. this so-called ""reactive"" intramolecular charge-transfer state creates an electron-deficient site across the double bond to trigger the subsequent nucleophilic attack of nadph, by the negatively charged hydride from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. this work provides the crucial, missing link between excited-state processes and chemistry in por. moreover, it provides important insight into how light energy can be harnessed to drive enzyme catalysis with implications for the design of light-activated chemical and biological catalysts.
polymerase_chain_reaction	introductionwomen with polycystic ovary syndrome have a three-fold higher risk of endometrial cancer. insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia may be pertinent factors in the pathogenesis of both conditions. the aim of this study was to investigate endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression in polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer endometrium, and to correlate endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression with serum lipid profiles. material and methodsa cross-sectional study was performed at nottingham university hospital, uk. a total of 102 women (polycystic ovary syndrome, endometrial cancer and controls; 34 participants in each group) were recruited. clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before endometrial biopsies were obtained from all participants. taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction for endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene and its systemic protein expression were analyzed. resultsthe body mass indices of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (29.282.91kg/m(2)) and controls (28.58 +/- 2.62kg/m(2)) were not significantly different. women with endometrial cancer had a higher mean body mass index (32.22 +/- 5.70kg/m(2)). sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was significantly increased in polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer endometrium compared with controls (p<0.0001). sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was positively correlated with body mass index (r=0.017, p=0.921) and waist-hip ratio (r=0.023, p=0.544) in polycystic ovary syndrome, but this was not statistically significant. similarly, statistically insignificant positive correlations were found between endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression and body mass index in endometrial cancer (r=0.643, p=0.06) and waist-hip ratio (r=0.096, p=0.073). sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was significantly positively correlated with triglyceride in both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer (p=0.028 and p=0.027, respectively). quantitative serum sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene correlated with endometrial gene expression (p<0.05). conclusionssterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression is significantly increased in the endometrium of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and women with endometrial cancer compared with controls and positively correlates with serum triglyceride in both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer.
thermodynamics	caffeic acid (ca) is a plant polyphenol which acts as an antioxidant and has various pharmacological effects. dna is one of the major cellular targets of therapeutic molecules. thus, studying the interaction of small molecules with dna is of great importance. in the current article, we have studied the mode of binding of ca with calf thymus dna (ct-dna) using a series of biophysical techniques. formation of complex between ca and ct-dna is ascertained by analyzing the uv-vis absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra of ca upon successive addition of ct-dna. binding constants of ca with ct-dna obtained using multiple experiments was in the order of 103 m-1 which is consistent with known groove binders. analysis of thermodynamic parameters suggest that hydrogen bonding and van der waal 's forces played major role in the binding process. competitive displacement studies confirmed that ca binds to the minor groove of ct-dna. these observations were further validated by ki quenching experiment, dna melting studies, cd and viscosity measurements. in silico molecular docking further provided insight into the mode of binding of ca with ct-dna. through in vitro experiments and in silico molecular docking studies, it was concluded that ca binds to the minor groove of ct-dna.

machine_design	this paper puts forward a novel design method of permanent magnet synchronous generator (pmsg). the most significant advantage of this method is that the output power of pmsg can be prominently improved without increasing any material costs. the main difference from the traditional design scheme is that the volume of permanent magnet (pm) remains unchanged during the entire design procedure. and the maximum output power scheme is found out just by optimizing the pm 's shapes with the change of mechanical pole-arc coefficient. in other words, this method aims to obtain the maximum pm utilization design scheme that can produce more ""effective"" magnet field so that it can generate the larger output power. the dimension parameters of pms with different shapes are calculated by the equivalent analytic geometry method. to verify its availability, this novel method is performed on four common types of pmsgs with different rotor structures, and their satisfactory performance results are obtained. the comparison with the traditional machine design scheme is also presented to illustrate the innovation and priority. the finite element analysis method based on ansoft/maxwell is applied for the electromagnetic models' building and simulation.
cell_biology	the complex pathology of spinal cord injury (sci), involving a cascade of secondary events and the formation of inhibitory barriers, hampers regeneration across the lesion site and often results in irreversible loss of motor function. the limited regenerative capacity of endogenous cells after sci has led to a focus on the development of cell therapies that can confer both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative benefits. stem cells have emerged as a candidate cell source because of their ability to self-renew and differentiate into a multitude of specialized cell types. while ethical and safety concerns impeded the use of stem cells in the past, advances in isolation and differentiation methods have largely mitigated these issues. a confluence of work in stem cell biology, genetics, and developmental neurobiology has informed the directed differentiation of specific spinal cell types. after transplantation, these stem cell-derived populations can replace lost cells, provide trophic support, remyelinate surviving axons, and form relay circuits that contribute to functional recovery. further refinement of stem cell differentiation and transplantation methods, including combinatorial strategies that involve biomaterial scaffolds and drug delivery, is critical as stem cell-based treatments enter clinical trials. biotechnol. bioeng. 2017;114: 245-259.

fluid_mechanics	the role of hyaline hairs on the thallus of brown algae in the genus fucus is long debated and several functions have been proposed. we used a novel motorized set-up for two-dimensional and three-dimensional mapping with o-2 microsensors to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the diffusive boundary layer (dbl) and o-2 flux around single and multiple tufts of hyaline hairs on the thallus of fucus vesiculosus. flow was a major determinant of dbl thickness, where higher flow decreased dbl thickness and increased o-2 flux between the algal thallus and the surrounding seawater. however, the topography of the dbl varied and did not directly follow the contour of the underlying thallus. areas around single tufts of hyaline hairs exhibited a more complex mass-transfer boundary layer, showing both increased and decreased thickness when compared with areas over smooth thallus surfaces. over thallus areas with several hyaline hair tufts, the overall effect was an apparent increase in the boundary layer thickness. we also found indications for advective o-2 transport driven by pressure gradients or vortex shedding downstream from dense tufts of hyaline hairs that could alleviate local mass-transfer resistances. mass-transfer dynamics around hyaline hair tufts are thus more complex than hitherto assumed and may have important implications for algal physiology and plant-microbe interactions.
manufacturing_engineering	wear resistance is an important rubber compound property related to useful product life. the rubber compound properties that affect wear behavior are very complicated. wear is related to a rubber compound 's cut resistance, tear resistance, fatigue resistance hardness, etc. the most commonly used test method to determine the wear resistance of rubber materials is abrasion test. tested compounds are usually compared on a ""volume loss"" basis which is calculated from the weight loss and density of the compound. this method is known to be variable and does n't give additional information for the wear behavior. for this reason we propose alternative approaches for examination of the wear behavior of rubber composites, giving information not only for the wear resistance but also for elastic the modulus, stiffness of the material, damage mechanism, etc. continuous multi-cycle indentation is used to determine the indentation hardness, elastic modulus and the stiffness with two indenter types - vickers and sphero-conical. comparison of both results is made in order to investigate the effect of the indenter type.
immunology	cancer is a serious hazard to human health all around the world; however, many current therapies remain toxic and poor. in view of the understanding of immunology and tumor biology, cancer immunotherapy with minimal toxicity has been regarded as a promising strategy for cancer treatment because of immune surveillance. unfortunately, the efficacy of immunotherapy was impeded and resisted due to the tumor immune evasion mechanism. hence, targeted cancer immunotherapy has been proposed to tackle the tumor immune suppression and complexity of malignant tumor cells. nanotechnology-based immunotherapy has improved the limitations and enhanced the therapeutic efficiency of traditional immunotherapy. this review illustrates the recent progresses in immunotherapy based on nanotechnology, and reveals that nanodevices could be utilized for active and passive cancer immunotherapy.
fluid_mechanics	in this article, the performance of two analytical methods known as the homotopy perturbation method (hpm) and adomian decomposition method (adm) on solving linear and nonlinear boundary value problems structural engineering and fluid mechanics are compared. in order to compare these mathematical models, various problems in inelastic and viscoelastic flows, deformation of beams, and plate deflection theory are chosen. in addition, the results of these two methods are compared with exact solutions to evaluate the precision and accuracy of these numerical methods.
northern_blotting	aim: to clone delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase gene of moltierella isabellina and to functionally characterize this gene in vitro and in vivo. methods: reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to clone the open reading frame of delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase gene (d12d) of mortierella isabellina. plasmids pemicl12 and pymicl12 were constructed with it. pemicl12 was transformed into escherichia coli (e. coll) strain bl21 using cacl2 method for expression after induction with iptg. ptmicl12 was transformed into saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in-vsc1 using lithium acetate method for expression under the induction of galactose. northern blotting method was used to investigate the effect of temperature on the transcriptional level of this gene in s. cerevisiae strain in-vsc1. results: recombinant plasmids pemicl12 and ptmicl12 were successfully constructed and transformed into e. coli and s. cerevisiae separately with appropriate method. after induction with iptg and galactose, it was found that expression of delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase genes in e. coli and s. cerevisiae under appropriate conditions led to the production of active delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase, which could convert 17.876% and 17.604% of oleic acid respectively to linoleic acid by gc-ms detection in vitro and in vivo. conclusion: cloning and expression of m. isabellina d12d gene in e. coli and s. cerevisiae is successfully completed.

thermodynamics	zeolites are fascinating and versatile materials which are vital for a wide range of industries, due to their unique structural and chemical properties, which are the basis of applications in gas separation, ion exchange, and catalysis. given their economic impact, there is a powerful incentive for smart design of new materials with enhanced functionalities for maximizing their application performance. this review article intends to summarize the published reports on the applications of molecular simulation in adsorption, separation and diffusion. the theoretical aspects, adsorption thermodynamics, adsorption isotherm were comprehensively studied in relation to the adsorption applications and how the adsorbates' characteristics influence the adsorption. this review comprehensively discusses the theoretical and computational aspects of diffusion of pure components, long chain hydrocarbons or mixture diffusion, including the molecular dynamics simulations and kinetic monte carlo. furthermore, the cation-zeolite-adsorbate interactions are thoroughly examined so as to elucidate the role of cations in zeolites applications and how the cation exchange influences structural dynamics and properties of zeolites. this study also focuses on the role of cations in gas/liquid adsorption and separations.

immunology	polycomb group proteins regulate chromatin structure and have an important regulatory role on gene expression in various cell types. two polycomb group complexes (polycomb repressive complex 1 (prc1) and 2 (prc2)) have been identified in mammalian cells. both prc1 and prc2 compact chromatin, and also catalyze histone modifications. prc1 mediates monoubiquitination of histone h2a, whereas prc2 catalyzes methylation of histone h3 on lysine 27. these alterations of histones can lead to altered gene expression patterns by regulating chromatin structure. numerous studies have highlighted the role of the prc2 catalytic component enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (ezh2) in neoplastic development and progression, and ezh2 mutations have been identified in various malignancies. through modulating the expression of critical genes, ezh2 is actively involved in fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. in addition to cancer cells, ezh2 also has a decisive role in the differentiation and function of t effector and t regulatory cells. in this review we summarize the recent progress regarding the role of ezh2 in human malignancies, highlight the molecular mechanisms by which ezh2 aberrations promote the pathogenesis of cancer, and discuss the anti-tumor effects of ezh2 targeting via activating direct anti-cancer mechanisms and anti-tumor immunity.
northern_blotting	cell fate determination and differentiation during neurogenesis and myogenesis involve the sequential expression of several basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factors. the expression of neurod1/2 and the expression of nscl(nh1h)1/2 are closely related in many developing peripheral and central neuronal cells, suggesting an epistatic relationship between these two bhlh transcription factor families during neurogenesis. to investigate this relationship, a murine neuroblastoma cell culture system and single/double knock-out (ko) mice of neurod1 and neurod2 were utilized for the gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, respectively. both neurod1 and neurod2 were able to induce the transcription of nscl1 in vitro: however, they were not able to activate nscl2 transcription. the dna-binding ability of neurod1 was essential for nscl1 induction. to examine the epistatic relationship in vivo, we examined the expression of nscl1 and nscl2 in neurod1 and neurod2 ko mice and neurod1/2 compound mo mice by in situ hybridization, rt-pcr and northern blotting. the expression of nscl1 was lower in the neurod1 ko mice and was not further decreased in the double ko mice. however, the expression of nscl2 did not change in either the single ko or double ko mice. these results demonstrate that neurod1 is an upstream regulator of the nscl1 gene but not the nscl2 gene in mice. in addition, neurod2 is not involved in this regulatory pathway in vivo.

northern_blotting	a method for determining mrna half-lives in the polymorphic fungus candida albicans is described. it employs growth in a defined medium, the inhibition of transcription with thiolutin (10-20 mu g/ml), and quantitative northern blotting. the method is effective for the a72, sc5314, and cai-4 strains of c. albicans, and for mrnas that have a wide variety of decay rates and steady-state abundances. the range of half-lives detected (from 4-168 min) shows that this method is effective for mrnas with widely varying half-lives. the mrna decay rates obtained are compared with those for orthologous mrnas from saccharomyces cerevisiae. this procedure should work for a broad range of c. albicans strains and can be adapted to other fungal species.
human_metabolism	we developed a fast, selective and sensitive on-line lc/lc-ms/ms method for the simultaneous determination of nine parabens and seven environmental phenols in urine. parabens are widely used as antimicrobial preservatives. bisphenol a, triclosan, triclocarban, 2-phenylphenol, and benzophenones are used inter alia in disinfectants, sunscreens and in polymers. some of these substances are suspected endocrine disruptors. limits of quantification and analytical quality criteria fully met the needs for determining exposure levels occurring in the general population. we analyzed 157 spot urine samples from the general german population (59 females, 39 males and 59 children). for the parabens, we found methyl, ethyl and n-propyl paraben with high detection rates (77-98%), followed by n-butyl (36%), iso-butyl (17%), iso-propyl (3%) and benzyl paraben (3%). we detected no pentyl and heptyl paraben. urinary concentrations were highest for methyl paraben (median 24.5 mu g/l; 95th percentile 379 mu g/l) followed by ethyl (1.4 mu g/l; 35.2 mu g/l) and n-propyl paraben (1.2 mu g/l; 68.1 mu g/l). other environmental phenols with high detection rates were bpa (95%), triclosan (45%) and benzophenone 1 and 3 (26%). for most of the parabens/environmental phenols we found higher urinary levels in females than in males or children, probably due to differences in (personal care) product use. however, high levels (in the mg/l range) were also observed in children. exposure to the above substances is occurring worldwide. differences between countries do seem to exist and might be caused by different product compositions or different use habits. human metabolism data is urgently needed to extrapolate from urinary biomarker levels to doses actually taken up.

computer-aided_design	conventional planar transistor shows shrinking substrate bias effect at scaled technology. on the other hand, epitaxial delta-doped channel (edc) transistor shows substantial amount of substrate bias effect even at 16-nm channel length. this paper unveils the physics behind the substrate bias effect of an n-channel edc transistor through technology computer aided design simulation with analytical justifications. the depletion width for an edc transistor very weakly depends upon the applied substrate bias, and with scaling down of channel length, the depletion width insignificantly gets widened. the substrate control over the channel is high so that significant amount of substrate depletion charge terminates on the gate, instead of on the source and the drain. the degradation of threshold voltage roll off and drain-induced barrier lowering coefficient with the increase of substrate bias, is less for the edc transistor, compared to that of a conventional halo free transistor. the dependence of the substrate bias sensitivity on the thickness of the low-doped epitaxial layer and concentration of the high-doped layer is explored. the effects of reverse substrate bias on leakage power dissipation and intrinsic delay of edc and conventional transistors are discussed.
enzymology	dye-decolorizing peroxidases (dyps; ec 1.11.1.19) are heme enzymes that comprise a family of the dimeric alpha+beta barrel structural superfamily of proteins. the first dyp, identified relatively recently in the fungus bjerkandera adusta, was characterized for its ability to catalyze the decolorization of anthraquinone-based industrial dyes. these enzymes are now known to be present in all three domains of life, but do not appear to occur in plants or animals. they are involved in a range of physiological processes, although in many cases their roles remain unknown. this has not prevented the development of their biocatalytic potential, which includes the transformation of lignin. this review highlights the functional diversity of dyps in the light of phylogenetic, structural and biochemical data. the phylogenetic analysis reveals the existence of at least five classes of dyps. their potential physiological roles are discussed based in part on synteny analyses. finally, the considerable biotechnological potential of dyps is summarized. crown copyright (c) 2015 published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
enzymology	the diversity of reactions catalyzed by enzymes reliant on pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp) demonstrates the catalytic versatility of this cofactor and the plasticity of the protein scaffolds of the major fold types of plp-dependent enzymes. the enzymes of the transsulfuration (cystathionine gamma-synthase and cystathionine beta-lyase) and reverse transsulfuration (cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-iyase) pathways interconvert l-cysteine and l-homocysteine, the immediate precursor of l-methionine, in plants/bacteria and yeast/animals, respectively. these enzymes provide a useful model system for investigation of the mechanisms of substrate and reaction specificity in plp-dependent enzymes as they catalyze distinct side chain rearrangements of similar amino acid substrates. exploration of the underlying factors that enable enzymes to control the substrate and reaction specificity of this cofactor will enable the engineering of these properties and the development of therapeutics and antimicrobial compounds. recent studies probing the role of active-site residues, of the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways, as determinants of substrate and reaction specificity are the subject of this review. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phosphate enzymology.

southern_blotting	manganese superoxide dismutase (mn-sod) plays a crucial role in antioxidant responses to environmental stress. to determine whether mn-sod affects heat resistance of gracilaria lemaneiformis, we cloned mn-sod cdna sequences of two strains of this red alga, wild type and cultivar 981. both cdna sequences contained an orf of 675 bp encoding 224 amino acid residues. the cdna sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of the two strains shared relatively high identity (more than 99%). no intron existed in genomic dna of mn-sod in g. lemaneiformis. southern blotting indicated that there were multiple copies, possibly four, of mn-sod in both strains. both in the wild type and cultivar 981, sod mrna transcription and sod activity increased under high temperature stress, while cultivar 981 was more heat resistant based on its sod activity. this research suggests that there may be a direct relationship between sod activity and the heat resistance of g. lemaneiformis.

polymerase_chain_reaction	metabolic imbalance impairs fertility, because changes in concentrations of metabolites and hormones in the blood and follicular fluid create an unfavourable environment for early embryonic development. insulin is a key metabolic hormone known for its effects on fertility: insulin concentrations are increased during energy balance disturbances in diabetes or metabolic syndrome. still, insulin is frequently used at supraphysiological concentrations for embryo in vitro culture with unknown consequences for the developmental potential of the offspring. in the present study we investigated the effects of insulin exposure during in vitro bovine oocyte maturation on developmental rates, embryo quality and gene expression. supplementation of the maturation media with insulin at 10 or 0.1 mu gml(-1) decreased blastocyst rates compared with an insulin-free control (19.8 +/- 1.3% and 20.4 +/- 1.3% vs 23.8 +/- 1.3%, respectively; p<0.05) and led to increased cell numbers (nearly 10% more cells on day 8 compared with control; p<0.05). transcriptome analysis revealed significant upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (nrf2) stress response and cell differentiation, validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. to conclude, the results of the present study demonstrate that insulin exposure during in vitro oocyte maturation has a lasting effect on the embryo until the blastocyst stage, with a potential negative effect in the form of specific gene expression perturbations.
immunology	according to the brazilian association of organ transplants, in 2015, 19,408 bone transplants were performed in brazil, over 90% by dental surgeons. the surgical technique itself has a respectable number of reports regarding its clinical efficacy, as measured by long-term survival of dental implants in grafted areas. uncertainty remains, however, as to whether fresh frozen grafts from human bone donors remain immunologically innocuous in the body of the host. six male with no previous medical history of note, including systemic diseases, surgery or blood transfusion were selected. these patients underwent reconstructive procedures (sinus lifting) using fresh frozen human bone from a tissue bank. all patients had venous blood samples collected prior to surgery and 6 months after the procedure. anti-hla analysis for the detection of hla(human leukocyte antigen) antibodies was performed using methods such as the lab screen pra class i and class ii, lab screen single antigen class i and class ii, luminex platform. reactive individuals to the screening tests (lab screen pra) were further investigated to determine the specificity of the antibodies detected (lab screen single antigen) with a cutoff value of median fluorescence intensity >= 500. as a result, it was observed that two patients (33%) were positive in screening tests, one presenting with anti-hla class i and ii sensitization and the other with anti-hla class ii. the specificity analysis showed that the patients sensitized to hla class ii presented 4 specificities, 3 of which immunologically relevant. in the second individual, 23 specificities were identified, 6 of which immunologically important for hla class i and 4 specificities for hla class ii, 3 of these were immunologically important. all specificities detected had average fluorescence. these findings are suggestive that sinus-lifting procedures with allogeneic bone can induce immunological sensitization.
machine_design	this paper details the design considerations of a permanent-magnet three-phase synchronous machine for fault-tolerant operation. a multidisciplinary approach to the optimal design of the machine is adopted, targeted at minimizing the additional losses resulting from faulty operating conditions and accounting for the remedial control strategy implemented. the design of a closed-slot six-slot four-pole machine is presented. the machine is prototyped and tested to validate the analytical-computational performances predicted in the design and analysis stage under healthy and faulty conditions.
genetics	giardia duodenalis is a flagellated intestinal protozoan responsible for infections in various hosts including humans and several wild and domestic animals. few studies have correlated environmental contamination and clinical infections in the same region. the aim of this study was to compare groups of giardia duodenalis from clinical and environmental sources through population genetic analyses to verify haplotype sharing and the degree of genetic similarity among populations from clinical and environmental sources in the metropolitan region of campinas. the results showed high diversity of haplotypes and substantial genetic similarity between clinical and environmental groups of g.duodenalis. we demonstrated sharing of giardia genotypes among the different populations studied. the comparison between veterinary and human sequences led us to identify new zoonotic genotypes, including human isolates from genetic assemblage c. the application of a population genetic analysis in epidemiological studies allows quantification of the degree of genetic similarity among populations of giardia duodenalis from different sources of contamination. the genetic similarity of giardia isolates among human, veterinary, and environmental groups reinforced the correlation between clinical and environmental isolates in this region, which is of great importance for public health.
genetics	renewable energy production is expanding rapidly despite mostly unknown environmental effects on wildlife and habitats. we used genetic and stable isotope data collected from golden eagles (aquila chrysaetos) killed at the altamont pass wind resource area (apwra) in california in demographic models to test hypotheses about the geographic extent and demographic consequences of fatalities caused by renewable energy facilities. geospatial analyses of h-2 values obtained from feathers showed that 25% of these apwra-killed eagles were recent immigrants to the population, most from long distances away (>100 km). data from nuclear genes indicated this subset of immigrant eagles was genetically similar to birds identified as locals from the h-2 data. demographic models implied that in the face of this mortality, the apparent stability of the local golden eagle population was maintained by continental-scale immigration. these analyses demonstrate that ecosystem management decisions concerning the effects of local-scale renewable energy can have continental-scale consequences.
machine_design	design of an agricultural machine is a highly complex process due to interactions between the operator, machine, and environment. mountain coffee plantations constitute an economic sector that requires huge investments for the development of agricultural machinery to improve the harvesting and post-harvesting processes and to overcome the scarcity of work forces in the fields. the aim of this study was to develop a preliminary design for a virtual prototype of a coffee fruit harvester. in this study, a project methodology was applied and adapted for the development of the following steps: project planning, informational design, conceptual design, and preliminary design. the construction of a morphological matrix made it possible to obtain a list of different mechanisms with specific functions. the union between these mechanisms resulted in variants, which were weighed to attribute scores for each selected criterion. from each designated proposal, two variants with the best scores were selected and this permitted the preparation of the preliminary design of both variants. the archetype was divided in two parts, namely the hydraulically articulated arms and the harvesting system that consisted of the vibration mechanism and the detachment mechanism. the proposed innovation involves the use of parallel rods, which were fixed in a plane and rectangular metal sheet. in this step, dimensions including a maximum length of 4.7 m, a minimum length of 3.3 m, and a total height of 2.15 m were identified based on the functioning of the harvester in relation to the coupling point of the tractor.
machine_design	this paper presents a detailed approach to provide improved cooling and heat spreading in electric machine rotors using centrifugally-pumped revolving thermosiphons. design concepts are discussed that offer the following advantages: (1) high thermal performance across a wide range of operating points; (2) low-impedance heat paths; (3) excellent opportunities for integration with electric machine design for improved electromagnetic performance and structural design, as well as practical, cost-effective manufacturing. it takes advantage of centrifugal force to provide effective inertial pumping over a wide range of operating conditions. in addition, the new thermosiphon design is compatible, with existing standard electric machine manufacturing techniques and cooling needs. a condenser section fin and ramp structure provides consistently high condensation performance. surface texture design to promote effective nucleate boiling at high speeds is discussed, and fluid fill factor is analyzed. applications include induction and pm synchronous machines. benefits of these thermosiphons include increased steady-state power and torque density, increased and more consistent efficiency, and reduced permanent magnet volume and cost in pm synchronous machines. other applications may include centrifugal gas compression, chemical processes, and machine tools.
molecular_biology	chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qpcr analysis (chip-qpcr) is a widely used technique to study gene expression. a large number of students in molecular biology and more generally in life sciences will be confronted with the use of this technique, which is quite difficult to set up and can lead to misinterpretation if not carefully managed. this article describes a four-session laboratory practical designed for masters students to introduce this technique. during the practical, students work in pairs. they extract chromatin from mcf-7 culture cells stimulated or not by estrogens, then immunoprecipitate the transcription factor estrogen receptor alpha using an antibody directed against it. students then measure the enrichment of promoter dna target sequences from the chromatin that coprecipitates by qpcr. these are two estrogen responsive genes, ps2 (trefoil factor one) and pgr (the progesterone receptor). they learn how to analyze their chip-qpcr data by two methods: percent input and fold enrichment, and are taught about the interpretation limits of these two calculation methods. thus, this practical is a good framework for an in-depth discussion of how this technique can be used to study gene expression and for raising awareness of the importance of careful interpretation of results.

internal_combustion_engine	engine performance varies significantly due to the variations in weather conditions in different regions. so, in order to optimize the performance and fuel consumption, engines should be calibrated according to the weather conditions in which they operate. in this paper the effects of the air conditions (such as pressure and temperature) on the power and fuel consumption of the si engine are modeled. first a comprehensive one-dimensional model of the real engine is constructed in gt power (r), and validated with experimental data from actual engine. next, using this model, a set of experiments is carried out by varying pressure, temperature, and humidity of the incoming air, and engine speed. the measuring outputs are the power and bsfc of the engine. then, two mathematical models are developed using mlp neural networks and also regression technique to estimate the outputs in terms of the inputs. at last, the estimation ability of the models is shown by a set of new experiments. these models could be used in engine calibration and shift the process from a near blind one to the one in which prior information have a significant role.
genetics	polg gene encodes the catalytic subunit of dna polymerase gamma, essential for mitochondrial dna (mtdna) replication and repair. mutations in polg have been linked to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, resulting in autosomal recessive or dominant mitochondrial diseases. these mutations have been associated with heterogeneous phenotypes, presenting with varying severity and at different ages of onset, ranging from the neonatal period to late adult life. we screened 13 patients for polg mutations. all patients underwent a complete neurological examination, and in most of cases, muscle biopsy was performed. we detected 15 different variations in 13 unrelated italian patients. two mutations were novel and mapped in the pol domain (p.thr989dup and p.ala847thr) of the enzyme. we also report new cases carrying controversial variations previously described as incompletely penetrant or a variant of unknown significance. our study increases the range of clinical presentations associated with mutations in polg gene, underlining some peculiar clinical features, such as peo associated with corneal edema, and epilepsy, severe neuropathy with achalasia. the addition of two new substitutions, including the second report of an in-frame duplication, to the growing list of defects increases the value of polg genetic diagnosis in a range of neurological presentations.
cell_biology	in traditional microbiology laboratory activities, different strains of bacteria are exposed to uv radiation for varying lengths of time. this article provides information that expands on these activities (or uses them alone) with caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism with which to study the effects of uv radiation. these activities might be used in an introductory class to teach students the basics of working with c. elegans. in cell biology and microbiology classes, students might learn about how uv radiation can damage cells and cause cancer. these activities can also be used to teach the students about how genetic background can affect the sensitivity to uv radiation. in the laboratory, the students design their own activities by altering the parameters of the basic uv radiation experiment. by performing these laboratory activities, students will learn about uv radiation and about all parts of the scientific process.
materials_engineering	accreditation bodies for engineering education around the world have been advocating for the implementation of outcome based education. in order to achieve this effectively, engineering educators are increasingly adopting student-centered modes of learning. one such mode is problem based learning (pbl). in this paper experience with the implementation of micro-level pbl is described. here one topic in a course on electronic materials at the undergraduate programme in materials engineering is taught using pbl. at the end of the course, students feedback is recorded to gauge the success or otherwise of this learning method. in general, student are found to be more enthuiastic in learning with pbl than in lectures. they appreciated to have, in the pbl, an opportunity to play the role of a professional engineer and to apply acquired kowledge to solve a particular problem. student feedback reveals that pbl can be effective in achieving the programme outcomes (pos) that are not easy to achieve through lectures, such as those related to i) lifelong learning, ii) team work, iii) professional and ethical responsibility, iv) economic, social and environmental impact, etc.. thus pbl can complement lectures in successfully implementing outcome based education. implementation of pbl at the micro level, that is, for one topic in a course has been found to be fairly easy as it does not require any extra resources. since converting the whole undergraduate programme into pbl can be a formidable venture, it is believed that pbl can be adopted for a limited number of topics in some of the major courses in the programme with tangible benefits.
immunology	lymphocyte differentiation is set to produce myriad immune effector cells with the ability to respond to multitudinous foreign substances. the uniqueness of this developmental system lies in not only the great diversity of cellular functions that it can generate but also the ability of its differentiation intermediates and mature effector cells to expand upon demand, thereby providing lifelong immunity. surprisingly, the goals of this developmental system are met by a relatively small group of dna-binding transcription factors that work in concert to control the timing and magnitude of gene expression and fulfill the demands for cellular specialization, expansion, and maintenance. the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which these lineage-promoting transcription factors operate have been a focus of basic research in immunology. the mechanisms of development discerned in this effort are guiding clinical research on disorders with an immune cell base. here, i focus on ikaros, one of the earliest regulators of lymphoid lineage identity and a guardian of lymphocyte homeostasis.
computer-aided_design	temperature variation during semiconductor device operation can be significant and how this affects contact resistance is investigated. this paper reports improvements to analytical modeling for determining specific contact resistance (scr) by including the effect of temperature. a technique for extracting the value of scr using technology computer-aided design (tcad) modeling is also demonstrated. scr results obtained for analytical and tcad models for metal-to-silicon contacts are compared and this shows the significance of temperature in the analyticalmodel. small changes in electron affinity and, hence, barrier height due to changes in temperaturemust be considered in order to obtain reliable analytical expressions for scr.
southern_blotting	an efficient protocol for genetic transformation of somatic embryos of quercus robur by selection in a temporary immersion system is reported. the transformation frequency was 5 times higher than achieved by conventional culture on semi-solid medium, ranging between 6 and 26 % for the four genotypes evaluated. clumps of globular or torpedo somatic embryos were precultured for 7-10 days, inoculated with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain eha105:p35sgusint and cocultivated for 4 days before being cultured for 4 weeks on semi-solid selection medium supplemented with 25 mg l-1 kanamycin. explants were transferred to rita(a (r)) bioreactors and subjected to a two-step selection protocol involving immersion in liquid medium supplemented with 25 mg l-1 kanamycin, for 18 weeks, and then with 75 mg l-1 kanamycin. putatively transformed explants appeared after serial transfer to selection medium over 12-16 weeks. the presence of neomycin phosphotransferase ii and beta-glucuronidase genes in the plant genome was confirmed by histochemical and molecular analysis, and the copy number was determined by southern blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. transformed somatic embryos were germinated and transferred to soil for acclimatization, approximately 8 months after inoculation of the original tissue with bacteria. as the limiting factor for recovery of plants from oak embryogenic lines is the low embryo conversion rate, axillary shoot lines were established from transformed germinated embryos. transformed embryos and shoots were cultured in medium with or without kanamycin and the responses to several morphogenetic processes (recovery after cryopreservation, germination, shoot proliferation, and rooting) were evaluated.
southern_blotting	telomere dysfunction is believed to be a significant factor in carcinogenesis. to elucidate the carcinogenesis mechanism in gastric cancer, the expression of telomeric proteins and changes in telomere length were investigated during multistage carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. tissue samples were obtained during surgical operations from the normal gastric mucosa of 10 patients, the precancerous lesions of 15 patients, the gastric cancer tissues (gc) of 20 patients, and of tumors due to gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis (gclm) from 5 patients. the expression of trf1, trf2, and tin2 proteins was measured by western blotting, while the expression of tert, ku70, and brca1 proteins was detected using the immunohistochemical method. the mean telomere length was determined by southern blotting. compared with normal gastric mucosa tissues, the expression of trf1, trf2, and tin2 proteins was significantly higher in precancerous lesions, gc, and gclm (p < 0.01). the expression of trf1, trf2, and tin2 proteins was significantly higher in gc and gclm than in precancerous lesions (p < 0.01). the expression of tert and ku70 proteins in precancerous lesions and gc tissues was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa tissues (p < 0.01). the expression of tert and ku70 proteins in gc tissues was significantly higher than in precancerous lesions (p < 0.01). in normal gastric mucosa, the brca1 protein was primarily located in the cell nucleus. in precancerous lesions and gc, the expression of the brca1 protein was apparent in the cell cytoplasm. the mean telomere length in precancerous lesions, gc, and gclm was significantly shorter than that in normal gastric mucosa tissues (p < 0.05). the mean telomere length in gc and gclm was significantly shorter than that in precancerous lesions (p < 0.05). the mean telomere length in all tissue samples was inversely correlated with the level of trf1, trf2, tin2, tert, and ku70 proteins. our results suggest that the over-expression of telomeric proteins, trf1, trf2, tin2, tert, and ku70, and the transposition of the brca1 protein may work together to reduce the telomere length in precancerous lesions and gastric cancer, and could contribute to the multistage carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. these findings offer new insight into the mechanism of carcinogenesis in gastric cancer.
computer-aided_design	this case report describes a novel technique of restoring endodontically treated teeth. hidden caries causing irreversible pulpitis in a mandibular molar with radix entomolaris (re) was evident. the intact occlusal surface anatomy was duplicated before preparing an access cavity to replicate the original occlusal surface in the post endodontic restoration using (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) cad/cam technique. this report highlights uniquely designed onlay utilizing the benefits of contemporary materials and advanced technology.
southern_blotting	pointed gourd (trichosanthes dioica roxb.), a perennial dioecious plant of the family cucurbitaceae has recently emerged as an important cash crop due to its great medicinal and nutritive value. breeding programmes in pointed gourd have several constraints such as poor germination, vegetative means of propagation and dioecy. identification of male and female at the seedling stage is a pre-requisite for the genetic improvement of this species. screening of genomic dna with inter simple sequence repeat (issr) primers was used for early detection of male and female plants in this study. using pooled dna from male and female genotypes and 40 issr primers, a putative male specific marker tdmsm was produced. it was converted into a sequence tagged marker tdstsm which could successfully amplify 720 bp product in male but not in the female. southern blotting confirmed it as a single copy locus found only in male plant. further, the tdstsm marker was used to accurately detect 9 males and 6 females from 15 individuals of pointed gourd with unknown sex. thus, the sts primers designed from issr fragment tdmsm could be used as an effective and reliable molecular marker for early sex diagnosis in t. dioeca.

strength_of_materials	failure mechanisms of materials are intrinsically intertwined with nonhomogeneity and randomness at fine scales. by using mean field data for heterogeneous materials, homogeneous materials-based fracture models might result in prediction of unrealistic smooth crack trajectories and consequently unreliable load-carrying capacity. this study aims to develop a heterogeneous cohesive (hc) crack model to predict macroscopic strength of materials based on meso-scale random fields of fracture properties. by characterizing spatially varying fracture properties as random fields, heterogeneous cohesive crack propagation is simulated to predict more realistic crack paths and to more reliably assess macroscopic load-carrying capacity. a new stress-based criterion to determine the crack growth direction is developed by taking into account both the crack-tip stress state and heterogeneity of the tensile strength. a concrete beam subjected to mixed-mode fracture is modelled as a benchmark example to demonstrate the hc crack model. the numerical simulation reveals that crucial fracture phenomena, such as the tortuousness in crack trajectories, can be effectively captured by the hc model. effects of various important parameters on the crack paths, peak loads, macroscopic ductility and overall reliability, including the variance of random fields, the correlation length, and the shear fracture resistance, are investigated and discussed. criticality of the crack propagation incremental length in fracture modelling of random heterogeneous materials is especially highlighted.

genetics	scientific discoveries and technological advancements are inseparable but not always take place in a coherent chronological manner. in the next, we will provide a seemingly unconnected and serendipitous series of scientific facts that, in the whole, converged to unveil dna and its duplication. we will not cover here the many and fundamental contributions from microbial genetics and in vitro biochemistry. rather, in this journey, we will emphasize the interplay between microscopy development culminating on super resolution fluorescence microscopy (i.e., nanoscopy) and digital image analysis and its impact on our understanding of dna duplication. we will interlace the journey with landmark concepts and experiments that have brought the cellular dna replication field to its present state.
northern_blotting	background/aims: connective tissue growth factor (ctgf/ccn2) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis and suggested as a downstream mediator of the fibrogenic master cytokine tgf-beta. methods: we investigated the effect of tgf-beta 1 on ctgf/ccn2 expression in cultured rat hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes by means of western and northern blotting, immunocytochemistry, reporter gene analysis, and metabolic labelling. results: we found that the expression of ctgf/ccn2 in hepatic stellate cells is (i) only marginally (if at all) stimulated by tgf-beta and by a constitutively active type i tgf-beta receptor, (ii) independent from smad2/3 phosphorylation, (iii) not reduced by tgf-beta 1 antagonists or alk5-receptor inhibitors and (iv) not upregulated during transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in culture. however, expression and secretion of ctgf/ccn2 in cultured hepatocytes increased spontaneously during culture and was strongly stimulated by tgf-beta 1. in bile-duct ligated and ccl4-treated rat livers, a strong ctgf/ ccn2 expression in hepatocytes was noticed. endothelin-1 stimulated ctgf/ccn2 expression in stellate cells but not in hepatocytes. pathway specific signalling inhibitors point to the involvement of non-smad signalling cascades but their contribution to ctgf/ccn2 regulation is different in both cell types. conclusions: the results do not reveal a relevant interrelation between tgf-beta function and ctgf/ccn2 expression in hepatic stellate cells, which is in contrast to hepatocytes.

immunology	multiple mutation combinations in the igg fc have been characterized to tailor immune effector function or igg serum persistence to fit desired biological outcomes for monoclonal antibody therapeutics. an unintended consequence of introducing mutations in the fc (particularly the c(h)2 domain) can be a reduction in biophysical stability which can correlate with increased aggregation propensity, poor manufacturability, and lower solubility. herein, we characterize the changes in igg conformational and colloidal stability when 2 sets of c(h)2 mutations ""tm"" (l234f/l235e/p331s) and ""yte"" (m252y/s254t/ t256e) are combined to generate an antibody format lacking immune receptor binding and exhibiting extended half-life. in addition to significantly lowered thermostability, we observe greater conformational flexibility for tm-yte in c(h)2, increased self-association, and poorer solubility and aggregation profiles. to improve these properties, we dissected the contributions of individual mutations within tm-yte on thermostability and substituted destabilizing mutations with new mutations that raise thermostability. one novel combination, fqq-yte (l234f/l235q/k322q/m252y/s254t/t256e), had significantly improved conformational and colloidal stability, and was found to retain the same biological activities as tm-yte (extended half-life and lack of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity). our engineering approach offers a way to improve the developability of antibodies containing fc mutations while retaining tailored biological activity.

computer-aided_design	assembly or disassembly sequence planning is a very hard combinatory problem while the assembly parts numbers become important. to reduce this difficulty, especially for the case of complex products, the subassembly identification concept can constitute an original way. it aims to decompose the complex assembly product into some subassembly entities containing a small number of parts. consequently, the generation of assembly or disassembly sequence planning of parts becomes between the subassemblies and, in that case, can be determined relatively easily. despite the prettiness of the subassembly method, the identification of subassembly from a computer-aided design (cad) model remains a relevant research subject to be improved. in this paper, a subassembly identification approach is presented. the proposed approach begins with the exploration of the cad assembly data to carry out an adjacency matrix. then, to identify the subassemblies, the extracted matrix is transformed through three steps. the first step consists of idealizing this matrix by removing all connection parts identified by the feature-manager, which permits reducing its size. afterward, based on the reduced matrix, an all-direction matrix is constructed to identify the base part of a subassembly. the third step consists of enriching the all-direction matrix by mounting conditions to construct the set of subassemblies. an example of a cad assembly mechanism is presented in all sections of this paper in order to explain and discuss the steps of the proposed approach.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background and objectiveperiodontal disease is a chronic infectious disease that results in bone loss. many epidemiological studies have reported the progression of periodontal tissue destruction in patients with diabetes; however, the associated mechanism remains unclear. in this study, we comprehensively investigated how diabetes affects the periodontal tissue and alveolar bone loss using a ligature-induced periodontitis model in streptozotocin-induced diabetic (stz) mice. material and methodsdiabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection with streptozotocin in 6-wk-old c57/bl6j male mice. a silk ligature was tied around the maxillary left second molar in 9-wk-old wild-type (wt) and stz mice. bone loss was evaluated at 3 and 7 d after ligation. mrna expression levels in the gingiva between the two groups were examined by dna microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction at 1, 3 and 7 d post-ligation. tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase staining of the periodontal tissue was performed for evaluation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in histological analysis. resultsin the gingiva, hyperglycemia upregulated the osteoprotegerin (opg) mrna expression and downregulated osteocalcin mrna expression. in the ligated gingiva, tumor necrosis factor- (tnf-) mrna expression was upregulated at 1 d post-ligation in stz mice but not in wt mice. at 3 d post-ligation, alveolar bone loss was observed in stz mice, but not in wt mice. significantly severe alveolar bone loss was observed in stz mice compared to wt mice at 7 d post-ligation. bone metabolic analysis using dna microarray showed significant downregulation in the mrna expression of glioma-associated oncogene homologue 1 (gli1) and collagen type vi alpha 1 (col6a1) at the gingiva of the ligated site in stz mice compared to that in wt mice. quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that gli1 and col6a1 mrna expression levels were significantly downregulated in the gingiva of the ligated site in stz mice compared to wt mice. histological analysis showed lower alkaline phosphatase activity in stz mice. in addition, an increased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were observed at the ligated sites in stz mice. conclusionsthese results suggest that an imbalance of bone metabolism causes osteoclastosis in insulin-deficient diabetes, and that alveolar bone loss could occur at an early phase under this condition.
human_metabolism	one of the most important of the nutrient intake values (nivs) is the average nutrient requirement (anr). the anr is defined as an intake value that will be adequate for half of the individuals in a group of people with similar characteristics. it is used to estimate the prevalence of adequacy, and it serves as the basis for the individual nutrient level (inlx). the determination of adequacy is a complex process, with the resulting value of the anr dependent on the criterion or functional outcome chosen to define nutrient adequacy. because nutrients have multiple sites of action in human metabolism, it is possible to demonstrate abnormal function in one parameter measured or observed as a result of inadequate intake of a nutrient, while other parameters requiring the same nutrient appear normal or within normal ranges. thus, depending on the criterion of adequacy selected, the requirement for a given nutrient may be at a lower or a higher intake amount. in harmonizing development of nivs, it is important to clearly identify the criterion of adequacy selected and the rationale for its selection. rarely are available data sufficient to provide dose-response information from which to select a level of intake at which half of the individuals demonstrate adequacy and half appear to demonstrate inadequacy. three levels of intake, of which at least one level of intake is below the requirement for most of the individuals in the sample, and one level of intake is above their requirement, are useful for establishing, a level at which half of the group might be considered to demonstrate adequacy. types of human nutrient studies that may be used to obtain data are discussed, as well as characteristics of the sample size needed to demonstrate adequacy. the variation in requirements is also an important aspect in predicting levels of intake that will have defined probabilities of adequacy for groups (to develop the inlx, where x is the defined probability chosen). an analysis of the origins of different types of variability is presented. when estimating energy requirements, a special case of nivs, important issues must be considered. additionally, an example of evaluating data used to establish an anr for vitamin a, and the effect of variability in requirements for vitamin a, is provided.
fluid_mechanics	the main purpose of this research aims design a vacuum for removal of brain tumors with disconnectors microdestruccion and integrated control system. the development of the project is to remove most of the tumor brain and thus improve the standard of living of the patient. for this design it developed different types of cutting tools, thus obtaining a disconnector for other hard tissue and soft tissue. on the other hand, it was designed using vacuum techniques and fluid mechanics, suction cannulae which consist of a small metal nozzle be in direct contact with the patient. then, a system of open loop control which monitor and control system variables suction, pumping irrigation fluid and level control in the tanks of tumor material, in order to obtain a computer user friendly designed. it was subsequently verified by the simulator automation studio 3.0.5, operation of the control system and finally an analysis of technical and economic feasibility obtaining the final solution is feasible for implementation in the country was conducted.
cell_biology	complications resulting from impaired fracture healing have major clinical implications on fracture management strategies. novel concepts taken from developmental biology have driven research strategies towards the elaboration of regenerative approaches that can truly harness the complex cellular events involved in tissue formation and repair. advances in polymer technology and a better understanding of naturally derived scaffolds have given rise to novel biomaterials with an increasing ability to recapitulate native tissue environments. this coupled with advances in the understanding of stem cell biology and technology has opened new avenues for regenerative strategies with true clinical translatability. these advances have provided the impetus to develop alternative approaches to enhance the fracture repair process. we provide an update on these advances, with a focus on the development of novel biomimetic approaches for bone regeneration and their translational potential.
human_metabolism	the use of caffeine, nicotine and some major metabolites was investigated by wastewater analysis in 13 sewage treatment plants (stps) across italy, and their suitability was tested as qualitative and quantitative biomarkers for assessing population size and dynamics. a specific analytical method based on mass spectrometry was developed and validated in raw urban wastewater, and included two caffeine metabolites, 1-methylxanthine and 7-methylxanthine, never reported in wastewater before. all these compounds were found widely at the mu g/l level. mass loads, calculated by multiplying concentrations by the wastewater daily flow rate and normalized to the population served by each plant, were used to compare the profiles from different cities. some regional differences were observed in the mass loads, especially for nicotine metabolites, which were significantly higher in the south than in the center and north of italy, reflecting smoking prevalences from population surveys. there were no significant weekly trends, although the mean mass loads of caffeine and its metabolites were slightly lower during the weekend. most caffeine and nicotine metabolites fulfilled the requirements for an ideal biomarker for the assessment of population size, i.e. being easily detectable in wastewater, stable in sewage and during sampling, and reflecting human metabolism. nicotine metabolites were tested as quantitative biomarkers to estimate population size and the results agreed well with census data. caffeine and its metabolites were confirmed as good qualitative biomarkers, but additional information is needed on the caffeine metabolism in relation to the multiple sources of its main metabolites. this exploratory study opens the way to the routine use of nicotine metabolites for estimating population size and dynamics.

southern_blotting	the basic leucine zipper (bzip) proteins are ubiquitous in plants and play important roles in plant defense responses. in this study, based on an expressed sequence tag from a suppression subtractive hybridization cdna library of lilium regale wilson during fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lilii infection, a novel bzip transcription factor gene lrbzip1 was isolated from l. regale root using the rapid amplification of cdna ends method. the predicted protein of lrbzip1 with 142 amino acid residues contains a basic domain signature and a leucine zipper motif. the quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis showed that the transcription level of lrbzip1 was higher in roots of l. regale than in young stems and leaves. moreover, the expression of lrbzip1 was up-regulated in the incompatible interaction between l. regale and f. oxysporum f. sp. lilii as well as after treatments with stress-related signaling molecules. to verify the function of lrbzip1, a constitutive expression vector of lrbzip1 was constructed and transferred into tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l. cv xanthi). the results of southern blotting and qrt-pcr analyses demonstrated that the lrbzip1 was integrated into genome of the tobacco transformants and highly expressed. under normal conditions, the t1 transgenic tobacco lines showed higher antioxidant enzyme activities and transcription levels of several resistance-related genes than the wild type. moreover, the t1 transgenic tobacco plants showed strong resistance to f. oxysporum f. sp. lilii infection.
genetics	due to the high plasticity of coralline algae, identification based on morphology alone can be extremely difficult, so studies increasingly use a combination of morphology and genetics in species delimitation. a dna barcoding study was carried out on maerl-forming coralline algae using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene, co1, and the plastid gene, psba, on field specimens from falmouth and oban together with herbarium specimens from the natural history museum, uk, and the smithsonian institution, washington, usa. results revealed the presence in the north of britain of a new species, lithothamnion erinaceum melbourne & j. brodie, sp. nov., which was previously misidentified as lithothamnion glaciale. the results also indicated that lithothamnion lemoineae, which had earlier been recorded from britain, was not present. one of the biggest concerns at present is how organisms will respond to climate change and ocean acidification, and it is imperative that investigations are put on a firm taxonomic basis. our study has highlighted the importance of using molecular techniques to aid in the elucidation of cryptic diversity.
enzymology	in recent years, a plethora of studies have demonstrated the paramount physiological importance of the gut microbiota on various aspects of human health and development. particular focus has been set on probiotic members of this community, the best studied of which are assigned into the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium genera. effects such as pathogen exclusion, alleviation of inflammation and allergies, colon cancer, and other bowel disorders are attributed to the activity of probiotic bacteria, which selectively ferment prebiotics comprising mainly non-digestible oligosaccharides. thus, glycan metabolism is an important attribute of probiotic action and a factor influencing the composition of the gut microbiota. in the quest to understand the molecular mechanism of this selectivity for certain glycans, we have explored the routes of uptake and utilization of a variety of oligosaccharides differing in size, composition, and glycosidic linkages. a combination of ""omics"" technologies bioinformatics, enzymology and protein characterization proved fruitful in elucidating the protein transport and catabolic machinery conferring the utilization of glucosides, galactosides, and xylosides in the two clinically validated probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04. importantly, we have been able to identify and in some cases validate the specificity of several transport systems, which are otherwise poorly annotated. further, we have demonstrated for the first time that non-naturally occurring tri- and tetra-saccharides are internalized and efficiently utilized by probiotic bacteria in some cases better than well-established natural prebiotics. selected highlights of these data are presented, emphasising the importance and the diversity of oligosaccharide transport in probiotic bacteria.
thermodynamics	we study an s-p model magnetic system with a triplet ground state coupled to two temperature baths. by varying the temperatures we both generate non-thermal electronic distributions and create additional coherences in the density matrix of the system. thus the thermally-induced magnetic response goes beyond the simple picture of majority-minority population dynamics. furthermore, we discuss the influence of temperature induced relaxation effects on the dynamics induced by an optical perturbation for this quantum system.

genetics	balancing selection describes any form of natural selection, which results in the persistence of multiple variants of a trait at intermediate frequencies within populations. by offering up a snapshot of multiple co-occurring functional variants and their interactions, systems under balancing selection can reveal the evolutionary mechanisms favouring the emergence and persistence of adaptive variation in natural populations. we here focus on the mechanisms by which several functional variants for a given trait can arise, a process typically requiring multiple epistatic mutations. we highlight how balancing selection can favour specific features in the genetic architecture and review the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms shaping this architecture. first, balancing selection affects the number of loci underlying differentiated traits and their respective effects. control by one or few loci favours the persistence of differentiated functional variants by limiting intergenic recombination, or its impact, and may sometimes lead to the evolution of supergenes. chromosomal rearrangements, particularly inversions, preventing adaptive combinations from being dissociated are increasingly being noted as features of such systems. similarly, due to the frequency of heterozygotes maintained by balancing selection, dominance may be a key property of adaptive variants. high heterozygosity and limited recombination also influence associated genetic load, as linked recessive deleterious mutations may be sheltered. the capture of deleterious elements in a locus under balancing selection may reinforce polymorphism by further promoting heterozygotes. finally, according to recent genomewide scans, balanced polymorphism might be more pervasive than generally thought. we stress the need for both functional and ecological studies to characterize the evolutionary mechanisms operating in these systems.
genetics	purpose of review new risk stratification systems and treatment strategies have been introduced in recent years. we aim to provide an overview of these recent changes and summarise these data in a concise article that would be useful for clinicians. recent findings apart from clinical stage, disease genetics are now recognised as important prognostic risk factors, and various new cytogenetic changes with negative prognostic impact have been identified. new technologies such as minimal residual disease detection are also playing an important role in prognostic assessment. recent introduction of combination therapy with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs is showing promising results in high-risk patients and may partially abrogate the negative impact associated with some of the adverse risk factors. summary recent advance has improved our understanding of high-risk multiple myeloma, and new therapeutic agents are now coming through the pipeline for this patient group with once dismal outcome.
genetics	in october 2015, zika virus (zikv) outbreak the brazilian ministry of health (moh). in response, the brazilian society of medical genetics established a task force (sbgm-zetf) to study the phenotype of infants born with microcephaly due to zikv congenital infection and delineate the phenotypic spectrum of this newly recognized teratogen. this study was based on the clinical evaluation and neuroimaging of 83 infants born during the period from july, 2015 to march, 2016 and registered by the sbgm-zetf. all 83 infants had significant findings on neuroimaging consistent with zikv congenital infection and 12 had confirmed zikv igm in csf. a recognizable phenotype of microcephaly, anomalies of the shape of skull and redundancy of the scalp consistent with the fetal brain disruption sequence (fbds) was present in 70% of infants, but was most often subtle. in addition, features consistent with fetal immobility, ranging from dimples (30.1%), distal hand/finger contractures (20.5%), and feet malpositions (15.7%), to generalized arthrogryposis (9.6%), were present in these infants. some cases had milder microcephaly or even a normal head circumference (hc), and other less distinctive findings. the detailed observation of the dysmorphic and neurologic features in these infants provides insight into the mechanisms and timings of the brain disruption and the sequence of developmental anomalies that may occur after prenatal infection by the zikv.
molecular_biology	sex differentiation of flower buds is an important developmental process that directly affects fruit yield of cucumber (cucumis sativus l). plant hormones, such as gibberellins (gas) and ethylene can promote development of male and female flowers, respectively, however, the regulatory mechanisms of ga-induced male flower formation and potential involvement of ethylene in this process still remain unknown. in this study, to unravel the genes and gene networks involved in ga-regulated cucumber sexual development, we performed high throughout rna-seq analyses that compared the transcriptomes of shoot tips between ga(3) treated and untreated gynoecious cucumber plants. results showed that ga(3) application markedly induced male flowers but decreased ethylene production in shoot tips. furthermore, the transcript levels of m (csacs2) gene, ethylene receptor csetr1 and some ethylene-responsive transcription factors were dramatically changed after ga(3) treatment, suggesting a potential involvement of ethylene in ga regulated sex expression of cucumber. interestingly, ga(3) down-regulated transcript of a c-class floral homeotic gene, cag2, indicating that ga may also influence cucumber sex determination through an ethylene-independent process. these results suggest a novel model for hormone-mediated sex differentiation and provide a theoretical basis for further dissection of the regulatory mechanism of male flower formation in cucumber. statement: we reveal that ga can regulate sex expression of cucumber via an ethylene dependent manner, and the m (csacs2), csetr1, and erfs are probably involved in this process. moreover, cag2, a c-class floral homeotic gene, may also participate in ga-modulated cucumber sex determination, but this pathway is ethylene-independent.
fluid_mechanics	we describe a measuring transducer of electrical conductivity of liquids, used both under laboratory conditions and also for the study of ocean processes (under natural conditions). the transducer is represented in the form of a separate unit for laboratory investigations, which can be used as part of a deep-water hydraulic probe. for an example of different processes and flows, at the ipmekh ran laboratory of fluid mechanics it has been shown that a small-scale transducer has a high speed and high spatial resolution.
thermodynamics	the main problem of utilization of ceramic nanopowders consists in their tendency to form hard agglomerates. the inter-agglomerate space forms pores surrounded by numerous elementary particles (crystallites). such pores cannot be easily removed from the system during pressureless sintering. so, the obvious strategy for a technologist is to eliminate such pores at the level of shaping operations. dry pressing is a frequently applied shaping technique of ceramic materials. that is why mechanical strength of agglomerates should be as low as possible. it enables the elimination of inter-agglomerate pores to occur under moderate pressures, applied during the shaping process. this problem will be illustrated using the really nanometric (below 10 nm) zirconiayttria solid solution powder. the methods of effecting agglomerate strength will be shown. one of the elaborated powder preparation rout results in extremely soft agglomerates.
cell_biology	natural killer (nk) cells are innate immune lymphocytes that play critical roles in host defense against viral infection and surveillance against malignant transformation. long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are important immune system regulators. here, we analyzed human primary lymphocyte lncrna expression profiles to identify nk-lncrna signatures. we detected numerous novel nk-specific lncrnas with potential roles in regulating human nk cell differentiation and function. expression of lnc-cd56, an nk-specific lncrna, was positively correlated with that of cd56, a classical human nk cell surface marker. we showed that lnc-cd56 may function as a positive regulator of cd56 in primary human nk cells and differentiated nk cells from human cd34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. our data provide an annotated human nk cell lncrna expression catalog and demonstrate a key role for lncrnas in nk cell biology.
immunology	altered mental status in cryptococcal meningitis results in poorer survival, but underlying causes of altered mentation are poorly understood. within two clinical trials, we assessed risk factors for altered mental status (gcs score<15) considering baseline clinical characteristics, csf cytokines/chemokines, and antiretroviral therapy. among 326 enrolled participants, 97 (30%) had gcs<15 and these patients had lower median csf cryptococcal antigen titers (p = .042) and ccl2 (p = .005) but higher opening pressures (320 vs. 269 mm h2o; p = .016), il-10 (p = .044), and ccl3 (p = .008) compared with persons with gcs = 15. altered mental status may be associated with host immune response rather than cryptococcus burden.
human_metabolism	a new high-performance capillary electrophoresis assay for aminothiols in human blood, including homocysteine, a marker of several human metabolism disorders, has been developed. sample preparation involves conversion of disulfides to free thiols with triphenylphosphine, precipitation of proteins with sulfosalicylic acid, and conjugation of the thiols with monobromobimane. derivatized thiols were separated in a sodium phosphate buffer using a fused-silica capillary (65 cmx50 mum i.d.) at 30 degreesc. with the electric field of 250 v cm(-1), separation of homocysteine, glutathione and cysteine occurred at less than 10 min. detection at 250 or 234 nm was used to confirm the monobimane-thiols peaks. the detection limit was similar to5 nmol/ml for all labeled aminothiols. the proposed method for these compounds' analysis included simple sample preparation, high selectivity, good linearity (r(2)>0.999), high reproducibility (within-run precision for derivatized aminothiol peaks area rsd<5% for three times consequently injected sample); high reliability and the small volumes required for analysis made it suitable for clinical studies.

fluid_mechanics	according to the fluid mechanics and rolling theory, the rolling interface friction dynamic characteristics and their influence on rolling speed, rolling load, roller material, rolling temperature and oil properties were studied respectively with lubrication or without lubrication in hot rolling. the two-dimensional reynolds equation was established for steady and unsteady rolling friction interface. through the research of rolling interface friction characteristics influence on the mill vibration, we found that when the lubrication film thickness in the roll gap was thicker, the friction coefficient was lower, its damping effect and system stability was worse. and if the rolling speed is greater than a certain value, the rolling interface friction coefficient will fall sharply with the increase of rolling speed and produces the self-excited vibration caused by negative damping. so the contrast test with different rolling interface has been carried out, such as the emulsion is open or close, high chromium cast iron/high speed steel roller is put to use, high chromium cast iron roller is grinded finely or coarsely, rolling speed is normal/reduced. and the results showed that it had an obvious effect on the mill vibration suppression by the adoption of the emulsion close and high speed steel roller.
enzymology	the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-ag) is predominantly biosynthesized by sn-1-diacylglycerol lipase alpha (dagl-alpha) in the cns. selective inhibitors of dagl-alpha will provide valuable insights in the role of 2-ag in endocannabinoid signaling processes and are potential therapeutics for the treatment of obesity and neurodegenerative diseases. here, we describe the development of a natural substrate-based fluorescence assay for dagl-alpha, using a coupled enzyme approach. the continuous setup of our assay allows monitoring of dagl-alpha activity in real-time and in a 96-well plate format. this constitutes a major improvement to the currently available radiometric and lc/ms-based methods, which can be executed only in low-throughput formats. in addition, our assay circumvents the use of radioactive material. we demonstrate that our assay can be used to screen inhibitors of dagl-alpha activity, using 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as the physiologically relevant natural substrate of dagl-alpha. furthermore, our method can be employed to measure dagl activity and inhibition in the mouse brain membrane proteome. consequently, our assay should serve as a valuable tool for rapid hit validation and lead optimization of dagl-alpha inhibitors.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective/background: matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) have already been identified as key players in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa). however, the current data remain inconclusive. in this study, the expression of mmps at mrna and protein levels were investigated in relation to the degradation of collagen i and collagen iii. methods: tissue samples were obtained from 40 patients with aaa undergoing open aortic repair, and from five healthy controls during kidney transplantation. expression of mmps 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp)1, and timp2 were measured at the mrna level using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. at the protein level, mmps, collagen i, and collagen iii, and their degradation products carboxy-terminal collagen cross-links (ctx)-i and ctx-iii, were quantified via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. in addition, immunohistochemistry and gelatine zymography were performed. results: in aaa, significantly enhanced mrna expression was observed for mmps 3, 9, and 12 compared with controls (p <= .001). mmps 3, 9, and 12 correlated significantly with macrophages (p = .007, p = .018, and p = .015, respectively), and synthetic smooth muscle cells with mmps 1, 2, and 9 (p = .020, p = .018, and p = .027, respectively). at the protein level, mmps 8, 9, and 12 were significantly elevated in aaa (p = .006, p = .0004, and p < .001, respectively). no significant correlation between mrna and protein was observed for any mmp. aaa contained significantly reduced intact collagen i (twofold; p = .002), whereas collagen iii was increased (4.6 fold; p < .001). regarding degraded collagen i and iii relative to intact collagens, observations were inverse (1.4 fold increase for ctx-1 [p < .001]; fivefold decrease for ctx-iii [p = .004]). mmps 8, 9, and 12 correlated with collagen i (p = .019, p < .001, and p = 0.003, respectively), collagen iii (p = .015, p < .001, and p < .001, respectively), and degraded collagen i (p = .012, p = .049, and p = .001, respectively). conclusion: no significant relationship was found between mrna and protein and mmp levels. mmps 9 and 12 were overexpressed in aaa at the mrna and protein level, and mmp-8 at the protein level. mmp-2 was detected in synthetic smcs. collagen i and iii showed inverse behaviour in aaa. in particular, mmps 8, 9, and;12 appear to be associated with collagen i, collagen iii, and their degradation products.

polymerase_chain_reaction	differential gene expression profile was studied in dimocarpus longan lour. in response to treatments of simulated acid rain with ph 2.5, 3.5, and a control (ph 5.6) using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (ddrt-pcr). results showed that mrna differential display conditions were optimized to find an expressed sequence tag (est) related with acid rain stress. the potential encoding products had 80% similarity with a transcription initiation factor iif of gossypium raimondii and 81% similarity with a protein product of theobroma cacao. this fragment is the transcription factor activated by second messenger substances in longan leaves after signal perception of acid rain.
immunology	antithymocyte globulin (atg) is often included in the conditioning regimen to prevent graft vs. host disease in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (hsc) transplantation. however, because atg contains antibodies targeting a wide range of antigens on human cells, its potential off-target effects remain a concern. here, we explored this question in humanized mice that permit the analysis of human cell depletion in tissues. we showed that atg binds to almost all lineages of human hematopoietic cells including hscs, and accordingly it is capable of depleting almost all human hematopoietic cells. interestingly, the efficacy of atg was highly variable depending on the tissue of residence, with human cells in bone marrow significantly less susceptible than those in the blood and spleen. recovery of multilineage human lymphohematopoietic reconstitution in humanized mice that received atg 3 weeks after hsc transplantation indicates that atg had a minimal effect on human hscs that have settled in bone marrow niches. however, efficient human hsc depletion and engraftment failure were seen in mice receiving atg at the time of transplantation. our data indicate that the efficacy of atg is tissue-dependent, and suggest a potential risk of impairing donor hematopoietic engraftment when atg is used in preparative conditioning regimens.cellular & molecular immunology (2017) published online 26 october 2015
internal_combustion_engine	the purpose of this paper is to introduce and investigate a new application of hydrogen to a special internal combustion engine (free-piston engine generator). the development of a full-cycle zero-dimensional dynamic simulation model is described, and an extensive coupled research method is presented by the iteration simulation between the zero dimensional dynamic model and a multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics engine model of combustion process, giving insight into the operating characteristics and performances of the new hydrogen fueled engine. the influences of the piston motion on combustion process are analyzed. the performance characteristics of the new hydrogen engine are found to differ significantly from those of a corresponding traditional hydrogen engine and a free-piston gasoline engine. the results indicate that compared with the above-mentioned traditional hydrogen engine, the free-piston hydrogen engine has a higher piston acceleration around top dead center (tdc) and a advantage in terms of emissions formation due to faster power stroke expansion, but the indicated efficiency is slightly lower due to the longer late combustion process. moreover, the indicated efficiency, combustion velocity and peak pressure are both larger, compared with the free piston engine combusting gasoline, and the concentration of no emission also has an advantage. copyright (c) 2015, hydrogen energy publications, llc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
machine_design	this paper investigates the transient synchronization performance of a line-start permanent magnet synchronous machine (ls pmsm) taking into account the effect of the rotor cage slot design, active permanent magnet volume and load inertia. first the transient performances of a rotor cage with different slot profiles and the same cross sectional area are evaluated. the design optimization of ls pmsm with a selected rotor slot shape is then conducted by employing an adapted multi-step taguchi method. the aim of the optimization is to improve transient performance. in addition, the optimized rotor design is subjected to further sensitivity analysis by exposing the design to various noise factors such as the system 's moment of inertia and permanent magnet volume. this is to check the robustness of the design. finally, results are discussed and relevant conclusions are drawn.
thermodynamics	chitosan materials that were prepared from different sources of fishery waste were subsequently characterized and the influence of molecular weight (mw) and degree of deacetylation (dda) on the chitosan-acetic acid solution viscosity was studied. the mw of the prepared chitosan was found to influence the viscosity of the solution and, an increase in mw increases the viscosity of the chitosan acetic acid solution, while the dda was found not to influence the viscosity of chitosan-acetic solutions. chitosan solutions with varying concentrations and viscosities, were used to produce chitosan membranes by the phase inversion technique, followed by cross-linking the membranes using glutaraldehyde. the chitosan content of the membranes was found to be only 4-6 mol%, and the characterisation results indicated that the membranes could be visualised as consisting of a hydrated polymeric network in which chitosan forms a rigid honeycomb structure. the moisture that was present in the membrane was found to be present as fixed water, integrated with the chitosan that enabled the use of a pressure driving force for the removal of moisture from the membrane. the free water content was subsequently found to be equal to the porosity of the membrane, namely 65% of the total water in the membrane, with 30% of the water being characterised as fixed water. the membrane wet density, pore radius and specific surface area were determined as 1100 kg m(-3), 40 nm, and 1.15 x 10(5) m(2) kg(-1) respectively. subsequently, the chitosan membranes were found to be analogous in their transport behaviour to ultrafiltration membranes. the pure water flux of the membranes was found to be in the order of 12 lm(-2)hr(-1)bar(-1), and the transport of solutes and solvent could be modelled sufficiently at low solute concentrations using a generic membrane model derived from irreversible thermodynamics.

northern_blotting	we investigated the expression pattern of zinc finger protein gene in rice (oryza sativa l.) under various abiotic stresses. this gene contains an open reading frame encoding a zinc-finger protein of 171 amino acids and is induced by various stresses, namely salinity, drought, and cold. phylogenetic analysis based on deduced amino acid sequences of oszfp cdna revealed a significant sequence similarity to the zinc finger protein from diverse families of plant species. southern blot analysis of rice genomic dna suggested that oszfp is encoded by a multiple-copy gene. the steady-state levels of oszfp transcripts were found to increase in response to salinity, drought, and cold stresses. a rice zinc-finger protein gene, oszfp, encoding the cys2/his2-type zinc-finger transcription factor was isolated from rice using rt-pcr. the expression profiling indicated that oszfp was constitutively expressed in leaves and roots. the northern blotting showed that oszfp was strongly induced by high salinity and drought, but only slightly regulated by low temperature (4 degrees c). these results suggested that the oszfp may play an important role in rice responses to salinity, drought, and cold as a transcription factor.
internal_combustion_engine	due to combination of factors, such as environmental concerns, high oil prices and the potential for peak oil, development of cleaner alternative fuels and advanced power systems for vehicles has become a high priority for many governments and vehicle manufacturers around the world. use of gasoline as an alternative fuel in gasoline engine is becoming a need, looking at the scarcity of petroleum fuels in near future. this paper investigates the influence of compression ratio and ethanol-gasoline blending to find the effects on four-stroke si engine performance. in this research, air cooled engine having compression ratio of 9.1 & 9.7 is used. fuel blend e50 is used in the study and engine operated at a speed range of 600-1100 rpm. maximum power was obtained for e50 fuel at a compression ratio of 9.1, while, a minimum fuel consumption rate was obtained at a compression ratio of 9.7. this clearly depicts that as compression ratio increases, fuel consumption rate decreases considerably. further, experimental results showed that comparing several blends, 50% ethanol is cost and power effective for the four-stroke si engine.
strength_of_materials	the critical conditions to effect transverse fracture in canine teeth of carnivores in lateral loading are analyzed. the teeth are modeled as tapered coaxial beams with uniformly thin enamel coats. a stress analysis is first carried out using beam theory, and stress intensity factors for inward propagating cracks at the location of maximum tensile stress along the lingual face are then determined. the fracture begins as arrested channel cracks within the enamel, followed by stable penetration around the tooth and into the dentin to the point of failure. two- and three-dimensional finite element models are used to evaluate the full fracture evolution. the analysis yields an explicit scaling relation for the critical fracture load in terms of characteristic tooth dimensions, notably tooth height and base radius. the role of enamel, ignored in previous 'strength of materials' analyses, is shown to be important in determining the precursor crack equilibrium prior to full fracture. implications concerning allometry are briefly discussed.

molecular_biology	a simple and high sensitive cholesterol amperometric biosensor, which is based on in situ electropolymerization of multi-walled carbon nanotube-polyaniline (mwcnt-pani) nanocomposite and electrodeposition of platinum nanoparticle (nano-pt) films onto the glassy carbon electrode surface for cholesterol oxidase immobilization, was constructed in this study. the preparation process of the modified electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and chronoamperometry. because of the synergistic electrocatalytic activity between mwcnt-pani nanocomposites and nano-pt, the cholesterol biosensor exhibited an excellent performance with a linear range of 2.0-510.0 mu m, a detection limit of 0.8 mu m (signal-to-noise ratio = 3), a high sensitivity of 109.9 mu a mm(-1), and a short response time within 5 sec. moreover, the reproducibility, stability, and selectivity of the biosensor were also investigated.

polymerase_chain_reaction	tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (tnfaip8), a transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b-inducible, antiapoptotic and oncogenic molecule, is associated with prognosis of several human malignancies. however, the relationship between tnfaip8 and the prognosis of the invasive ductal carcinoma (idc) of the breast remains unclear. tnfaip8 expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and western blot analysis in 20 fresh idc tissues and immunohistochemical analysis in 351 paraffin embedded idc tissues. real-time pcr and western blot analysis demonstrated that both tnfaip8 messenger rna and protein were up-regulated in idc tissues compared with the paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. immunohistochemistry revealed that tnfaip8 expression was significantly correlated with some clinicopathological factors, including axillary lymph node metastasis (p = .001), advanced tnm stage (p < .001), high histologic grade (p < .001), molecular subtype (p < .001), and postoperative recurrence (p < .001). univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that tnfaip8 overexpression was strongly associated with axillary lymph node metastasis (odds ratio, 1.818; 95% confidence interval, 1.167-2.832; p = .008). moreover, kaplan-meier analysis indicated that idc patients with high tnfaip8 expression had a shorter survival time than did those with low tnfaip8 expression, and multivariate analysis indicated that tnfaip8 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival in idc (p = .041 and p = .020, respectively). therefore, tnfaip8 overexpression may contribute to tumor progression, and it may be a novel prognostic biomarker for the patients with idc.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: abnormal expression of some cd44 molecules in tumor tissues can induce the degradation of the extracellular matrix, and is closely associated with axillary lymph node metastasis, angiogenesis, cancer progression, and drug resistance. patients and methods: we measured and confirmed the expression of cd44st and mmp2 mrnas and proteins in the cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients with either adenocarcinoma (n = 72) or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 53) using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, gene sequencing, and immunohistochemical analysis. results: cd44st and mmp2 expression were closely associated with the histopathological classification, lymph node metastasis, and tnm stage of the tumors, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). the median overall survival (os) for the high cd44st expression group was 30.52 months (95% confidence interval (cl) 24.02-36.15); for the low expression group it was 43.23 months (95% cl 31.81-52.02) (p = 0.020). the median os for the high mmp-2 expression group was 30.53 months (95% cl 26.69-33.31); for the low expression group it was 40.06 months (95% cl 33.55-46.45) (p = 0.022). conclusion: the rates of cd44st and mmp2 expression were higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas, were closely associated with lymph node metastasis and tnm stage, and affected patients' prognoses.

southern_blotting	to develop a more efficient genetic transformation system for cryptomeria japonica (japanese cedar), the present study evaluated the effects of culture support during co-cultivation and the use of beta-lactam antibiotics (meropenem and carbenicillin) to eliminate agrobacterium on the transformation efficiency. the co-cultivation of embryogenic tissues and bacterium on filter paper wicks prevented the excess growth of agrobacterium compared with that observed on solid medium, leading to an increased number of gene-transferred cells. meropenem successfully eliminated the bacterium at low concentrations (10 mg l(-1)) and had no phytotoxic effect. the transformed tissues were screened based on kanamycin resistance and green fluorescent protein (gfp) fluorescence, and the integration of the transgene into the plantlet genome was confirmed by southern blotting. we successfully generated a mean of 105.3 +/- 9.02 independent transgenic lines per gram of embryogenic tissues using a combination of filter paper wicks and meropenem. the transformation efficiency of the improved method was approximately 30-fold higher than that observed using the conventional method.
human_metabolism	estimating the nature and extent of human cancer risks due to arsenic (as) in drinking water is currently of great concern, since millions of persons worldwide are exposed to arsenic, primarily through natural enrichment of drinking water drawn from deep wells. humans metabolize and eliminate as through oxidative methylation and subsequent urinary excretion. while there is debate as to the role of methylation in activation/detoxification, variations in arsenic metabolism may affect individual risks of toxicity and carcinogenesis. using data from three populations, from mexico, china, and chile, we have analyzed the distribution in urine of total arsenic and arsenic species (inorganic arsenic (inas), monomethyl arsenic (mma), and dimethyl arsenic (dma)). data were analyzed in terms of the concentration of each species and by evaluating mma:dma and (mma + dma):inas ratios. in all persons most urinary as was present as dma. male:female differences were discernible in both high- and low-exposure groups from all three populations, but the gender differences varied by populations. the data also indicated bimodal distributions in the ratios of dma to inas and to mma. while the gene or genes responsible for arsenic methylation are still unknown, the results of our studies among the ethnic groups in this study are consistent with the presence of functional genetic polymorphisms in arsenic methylation leading to measurable differences in toxicity. this analysis highlights the need for continuing research on the health effects of as in humans using molecular epidemiologic methods.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: micrornas are endogenously expressed, small non-coding rnas that modulate gene expression by targeting specific mrnas, resulting in translational repression or mrna degradation. although mir-584-5p has been reported to play a vital role in various malignancies, its role and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of mir-584-5p in gastric cancer (gc) remain to be clarified. in this study, we investigated the role of mir-584-5p in gc. methods: the expression of mir-584-5p and its specific target gene were determined in human gc specimens and cell lines by microrna real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) and western blot. the effects of mir-584-5p depletion or ectopic expression on gc proliferation were evaluated in vitro using cck-8 proliferation assays, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (edu) incorporation, colony formation assays and cell-cycle assays and the in vivo effects were investigated using a mouse tumorigenicity model. cell apoptosis was evaluated by in vitro flow cytometric analysis, cell viability assays and in vivo tunel assays. luciferase reporter assays were employed to identify interactions between mir-584-5p and its specific target gene. results: a series of in vitro and in vivo gain-and loss-of-function assays revealed that mir-584-5p inhibited gc cell proliferation, while apoptosis was induced. luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis revealed wwp1 to be a direct target of mir-584-5p. the effects of mir-584-5p-mimic were rescued by wwp1 overexpression. in contrast, the effects of the mir-584-5p-inhibitor were impaired by wwp1-shrna. furthermore, mir-584-5p expression levels correlated negatively with wwp1 protein expression in gc tissues and gc cell lines. a series of investigations indicated that mir-584-5p promoted senescence and activated the tgf beta signaling pathway by downregulation of wwp1. conclusion: taken together, these results suggest that downregulation of mir-584-5p contributes to tumor progression by downregulation of wwp1, thus, highlighting the potential of mir-584-5p as a therapeutic target for human gc.
molecular_biology	this review summarizes biogenesis, composition, intracellular transport, and possible functions of trichocysts. trichocyst release by paramecium is the fastest dense core-secretory vesicle exocytosis known. this is enabled by the crystalline nature of the trichocyst ""body"" whose matrix proteins (tmp), upon contact with extracellular ca2+, undergo explosive recrystallization that propagates cooperatively throughout the organelle. membrane fusion during stimulated trichocyst exocytosis involves ca2+ mobilization from alveolar sacs and tightly coupled store-operated ca2+-influx, initiated by activation of ryanodine receptor-like ca2+-release channels. particularly, aminoethyldextran perfectly mimics a physiological function of trichocysts, i.e. defense against predators, by vigorous, local trichocyst discharge. the tmp 's contained in the main ""body"" of a trichocyst are arranged in a defined pattern, resulting in crossstriation, whose period expands upon expulsion. the second part of a trichocyst, the ""tip"", contains secretory lectins which diffuse upon discharge. repulsion from predators may not be the only function of trichocysts. we consider ciliary reversal accompanying stimulated trichocyst exocytosis (also in mutants devoid of depolarization-activated ca2+ channels) a second, automatically superimposed defense mechanism. a third defensive mechanism may be effectuated by the secretory lectins of the trichocyst tip; they may inhibit toxicyst exocytosis in dileptus by crosslinking surface proteins (an effect mimicked in paramecium by antibodies against cell surface components). some of the proteins, body and tip, are glycosylated as visualized by binding of exogenous lectins. this reflects the biogenetic pathway, from the endoplasmic reticulum via the golgi apparatus, which is also supported by details from molecular biology. there are fragile links connecting the matrix of a trichocyst with its membrane; these may signal the filling state, full or empty, before and after tmp release upon exocytosis, respectively. this is supported by experimentally produced "" frustrated exocytosis"", i.e. membrane fusion without contents release, followed by membrane resealing and entry in a new cycle of reattachment for stimulated exocytosis. there are some more puzzles to be solved: considering the absence of any detectable ca2+ and of acidity in the organelle, what causes the striking effects of silencing the genes of some specific ca2+-release channels and of subunits of the h+-atpase? what determines the inherent polarity of a trichocyst? what precisely causes the inability of trichocyst mutants to dock at the cell membrane? many details now call for further experimental work to unravel more secrets about these fascinating organelles.
northern_blotting	background: hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) was initially discovered as a mitogen for hepatocytes, but it is also known to be related to carcinogenesis in many other organs. however, the role of hgf in lung carcinogenesis is not fully-understood. in this study, we investigated the role of hgf in lung carcinogenesis using hgf transgenic mice. materials and methods: to elucidate the role of hgf in lung carcino genesis, 5 mu g/g body weight diethylnitrosamine (den) were administered intraperitoneally to hgf transgenic (tg) mice and wild-type (wt) mice at 15 days of age. the incidence and number of lung tumors, the expression of hgf and of its receptor (c-met) were compared between hgf tg and wt mice. results: hgf overexpression accelerated den-induced lung carcinogenesis. seventy-six percent of tg mice (versus 50% of wt mice) developed malignant lung tumors by 48 weeks. the incidence of lung tumors was significantly higher in the tg mice in comparison with wt mice (p<0.05). furthermore, the mean diameter and number of tumors in each mouse were significantly higher in the tg mice compared to the wt mice (p<0.01). the northern blotting analyses revealed that there was overexpression of the hgf trans gene in the lung tumors of tg mice in comparison with the surrounding non-tumorous lesions. the western blotting analyses of the tumor lesions revealed increased phosphorylation of c-met. conclusion: our results suggest that hgf promotes lung carcino genesis through the autocrine activation of the hgf/c-met signaling pathway. the hgf/c-met signaling pathway appears to have vital roles in lung carcinogenesis.
materials_engineering	combining high strength, hardness and high toughness remains a tremendous challenge in materials engineering. interestingly nature overcomes this limitation, with materials such as bone which display unusual combinations of these properties in spite of their weak constituents. in these materials, highly mineralized ""building-blocks'' provide stiffness and strength, while weak interfaces between the blocks channel non-linear deformation and trigger powerful toughening mechanisms. this strategy is also exploited in multilayered ceramics, fiber-reinforced composites, and more recently in topologically-interlocked materials. in this work we apply these concepts to the toughening of glass panels by incorporating internal architectures carved within the material using three-dimensional laser engraving. glass is relatively stiff and hard but it has no microstructure, no inelastic deformation mechanism, low toughness and poor resistance to impacts. we demonstrate how introducing controlled architectures in glass completely changes how this material deforms and fails. in particular, our new architectured glass panels can resist about two to four times more impact energy than plain glass. our architectured glass also displays nonlinear deformation, progressive damage and failure contained within a few building blocks. this work demonstrates how micro-architecture, bio-inspiration and top-down fabrication strategies provide new pathways to transform the mechanics and performance of materials and structures.

molecular_biology	a novel approach for stem cell generation is the attempt to induce conversion of the adult somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells so called induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) by introducing specific transcription factors. ipscs have two essential cell characteristics, they are pluripotent and posses long term cell-renewal capacity. additionally, ipscs can be derived from patient-specific somatic cells, thus bypassing ethical and immunological issues. the aim of our study was to reprogram long-term cryopreserved human neonatal fibroblasts by new method using lipid nano-particle technology (lipofectamine 3000 reagent transfection system) in combination with epi 5 reprogramming vectors. obtained ipscs were characterized by several sophisticated methods of molecular biology and microscopy. distinct colonies of ipscs started to appear by day 20 after reprogramming. the presence of ipscs colonies was proved by alkaline phosphatase (ap) live staining. after manual picking the colonies and their subsequent passaging, they did not lose ability to form embryoid bodies, they were positive for ap, tra-1-60, and ssea-5. moreover, obtained ipscs expressed pluripotency markers oct4, sox2 and nanog, and the expression levels of chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic markers were significantly higher in comparison to control (p < 0.05). in summary, we have demonstrated that long-term cryopreserved human neonatal fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into ipscs and after further analysis concerns on their biological safety they may be used as patient-specific cells in regenerative medicine.
enzymology	htra2, a complex trimeric pyramidal mitochondrial serine protease that regulates critical biological functions and diseases, including apoptosis and cancer, is a promising therapeutic target. it promotes apoptosis through multiple pathways, complex mechanisms of which are still elusive. the existing model of activation that emphasizes relative intramolecular movements between c-terminal pdz and protease domains (pdz-protease collapse in inactive and resting states) has not been able to unambiguously demonstrate dynamics of its actions. using structure-guided design, molecular biology and protein biochemistry, we obtained various combinations of htra2 domains and mutants. conformational changes and stability were characterized using molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopic tools while functional enzymology delineated their roles in regulating enzyme catalysis. quantitative forster resonance energy transfer showed lesser intramolecular pdz-protease distance in trimeric htra2 compared to its inactive monomeric counterpart (approximate to 21 and approximate to 22.3 angstrom, respectively, at 37 degrees c). our findings highlight importance of n-terminal region, oligomerization, and intricate intermolecular pdz-protease interaction in proper active-site formation, enzyme-substrate complex stabilization, and hence htra2 functions. these observations redefine the existing activation model and showcase a unique example of how precise interdomain coordination, plasticity, and intermolecular contacts lead to distinct functional properties and hence provide new insights into htra2 structure, function, and dynamics.
strength_of_materials	the dynamic tensile strength of materials at load durations of a few microseconds or less is studied by analyzing the spall phenomena under shock pulse loading. the paper is devoted to discussing the methodology and capabilities of the technique to measure spall strength, its error sources, spall fracture of materials of different classes and the factors governing the high-rate fracture of metals and alloys under such conditions.
enzymology	s-adenosyl methionine (sam) is a universal biological cofactor that is found in all branches of life where it plays a critical role in the transfer of methyl groups to various biomolecules, including dna, proteins and small-molecule secondary metabolites. the methylation process thus has important implications in various disease processes and applications in industrial chemical processing. this methyl transfer is catalysed by sam-dependent methyltransferases (mtases), which are by far the largest groups of sam-dependent enzymes. a significant amount is now known regarding the structural biology and enzymology of these enzymes, and, consequently, there is now significant scope for the development of new mtases and sam analogues for applications from biomolecular imaging to biocatalytic industrial processes. this review will focus on current efforts in the manipulation of class i and v sam-dependent mtases and the use of synthetic sam analogues, which together offer the best prospects for rational redesign towards biotechnological applications. firstly, metabolic engineering of organisms incorporating small-molecule mtases is discussed; this can be applied in a variety of areas from the industrial bioprocessing of flavourants and antibiotics to frontier research in biofuel production and bioremediation. secondly, the application of mtases in combination with sam analogues is reviewed; this allows the tagging of proteins and oligonucleotides with moieties other than the methyl group. such tagging allows the isolation of the tagged biomolecule and aids its visualisation by a range of analytical methods. the review then summarises the potential advantages of mtase-mediated chemistry and offers some future perspectives on downstream applications.

internal_combustion_engine	the usage of a fuel cell (fc) as a range extender in a full electric vehicle (fev) is a convenient solution to address the issue of the shortage of range of this type of vehicles. compared with the internal combustion engine range extender (ice-re), the fuel cell - range extender (fc-re) has the potential to provide power with higher efficiency (more than 50%) and, above all, it can allow zero emissions operation of the vehicle even when the on-board power source is switched on for range extension. in this work, the introduction of a new ht-pemfc (high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell), developed in the framework of the collaborative european project artemis (automotive pemfc range extender with high temperature improved, meas and stacks), on a light duty, full electric, commercial vehicle, was investigated. firstly, a model of the full electric vehicle was created and validated by means of experimental tests carried out on rolling chassis dyno over both type approval and real world driving cycles. once the model was developed, the effects of the introduction of an ht-pemfc on the vehicle range was evaluated and the performances of different ht-pem fuel cell stack systems, combined with various hydrogen storage system configurations, were compared.

polymerase_chain_reaction	small leucine-rich proteoglycans are components of extracellular matrix that regulates neoplastic transformation. among small leucine rich proteoglycans, decorin, biglycan and lumican are most commonly implicated markers, and their expression is well studied in various malignancies. in this novel study, we have collectively evaluated expression of these three molecules in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. thirty patients of confirmed untreated bladder cancer, 30 healthy controls for blood and 30 controls for adjacent non-tumour tissue were enrolled. blood was collected from all subjects and tumour/adjacent normal tissue was obtained from the patients. circulatory levels were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, relative messenger rna expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western-blotting. circulatory levels of biglycan (p = 0.0038) and lumican (p < 0.0001) were significantly elevated, and that of decorin (p < 0.0001) was significantly reduced in patients as compared with controls. protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western-blotting showed elevated expression of lumican and biglycan and lower expression of decorin in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. quantitative polymerase chain reaction for messenger rna expression from tissue specimens revealed significantly higher expression of biglycan (p = 0.0008) and lumican (p = 0.01) and lower expression of decorin (p < 0.0001) in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. out of all molecules receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the 0.207 ng/ml cut-off of serum lumican provided optimum sensitivity (90.0%) and specificity (90.0%). significant alteration of matrix small leucine-rich proteoglycans in urothelial carcinoma of bladder was observed. higher expression of lumican in bladder cancer patients with the cut-off value of highest optimum sensitivity and specificity shows its importance as a potential non-invasive marker for early detection of ubc following further validation in large patient cohort.
immunology	chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a hematological cancer, characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)], producing the bcr-abl oncogene. tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) represent the standard of care for cml patients and exert a dual mode of action: direct oncokinase inhibition and restoration of effector-mediated immune surveillance, which is rendered dysfunctional in cml patients at diagnosis, prior to tki therapy. tkis such as imatinib, and more potent second-generation nilotinib and dasatinib induce a high rate of deep molecular response (dmr, bcr-abl1 <= 0.01%) in cml patients. as a result, the more recent goal of therapy in cml treatment is to induce a durable dmr as a prelude to successful treatment-free remission (tfr), which occurs in approximately half of all cml patients who cease tki therapy. the lack of overt relapse in such patients has been attributed to immunological control of cml. in this review, we discuss an immunological timeline to successful tfr, focusing on the immunology of cml during tki treatment; an initial period of immune suppression, limiting antitumor immune effector responses in newly diagnosed cml patients, linked to an expansion of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory t cells and aberrant expression of immune checkpoint signaling pathways, including programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1. commencement of tki treatment is associated with immune system re-activation and restoration of effector-mediated [natural killer (nk) cell and t cell] immune surveillance in cml patients, albeit with differing frequencies in concert with differing levels of molecular response achieved on tki. dmr is associated with maximal restoration of immune recovery in cml patients on tki. current data suggest a net balance between both the effector and suppressor arms of the immune system, at a minimum involving mature, cytotoxic cd56d""n nk cells may be important in mediating tfr success. however, a major goal remains in cml to identify the most effective pathways to target to maximize an advantageous immune response and promote tfr success.
polymerase_chain_reaction	mild therapeutic hypothermia is a candidate for the treatment of traumatic brain injury (tbi). however, the role of mild hypothermia in neuronal sprouting after tbi remains obscure. we used a fluid percussion injury (fpi) model to assess the effect of mild hypothermia on pericontusion neuronal sprouting after tbi in rats. male sprague-dawley rats underwent fpi or sham surgery, followed by mild hypothermia treatment (33 degrees c) or normothermia treatment (37 degrees c) for 3 h. all the rats were euthanized at 7 days after fpi. neuronal sprouting that was confirmed by an increase in growth associated protein-43 (gap-43) expression was evaluated using immunofluorescence and western blot assays. the expression levels of several intrinsic and extrinsic sprouting-associated genes such as neurite outgrowth inhibitor a (nogoa), phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (socs3) were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). our results revealed that mild hypothermia significantly increased the expression level of gap-43 and dramatically suppressed the expression level of interleukin-6 (il-6) and socs3 at 7 days after fpi in the ipsilateral cortex compared with that of the normothermia tbi group. these data suggest that post-traumatic mild hypothermia promotes pericontusion neuronal sprouting after tbi. moreover, the mechanism of hypothermia-induced neuronal sprouting might be partially associated with decreased levels of socs3.
enzymology	enzymology tends to focus on highly specific effects of substrates, allosteric modifiers, and products occurring at low concentrations, because these are most informative about the enzyme 's catalytic mechanism. we hypothesized that at relatively high in vivo concentrations, important molecular monitors of the state of living cells, such as atp, affect multiple enzymes of the former and that these interactions have gone unnoticed in enzymology. we test this hypothesis in terms of the effect that atp, adp, and amp might have on the major free-energy delivering pathway of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. assaying cell-free extracts, we collected a comprehensive set of quantitative kinetic data concerning the enzymes of the glycolytic and the ethanol fermentation pathways. we determined systematically the extent to which the enzyme activities depend on the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides. we found that the effects of the adenine nucleotides on enzymes catalysing reactions in which they are not directly involved as substrate or product, are substantial. this includes effects on the michaelis-menten constants, adding new perspective on these, 100 years after their introduction.

materials_engineering	the paper is devoted to analysis of the utilization possibilities of suitable similarity criteria for physical modelling of transfer processes between metal and slag including the presence of a third gaseous phase. the attention is also devoted to the modelling results and to the simulation methodology of the element transfer in the ladle. the modelling was done on a physical model of the ladle constructed on a geometric scale of 1: 9 located in the laboratory of physical and numerical modelling at the department of metallurgy, faculty of metallurgy and materials engineering. first, the discussion deals with the option of converting the operating variables to laboratory values, and vice versa. the suitability of the chosen similarity criteria for individual methodology of the simulation is also discussed. the results of the physical modelling of the transfer and homogenization processes are used as input data. the discussion is also focused on factors affecting the intensity of these processes under real operating conditions of the secondary metallurgy equipment. from analysis of the results, the final recommendations lead to the further expansion of the physical modelling techniques and to the results complementation by the data obtained from the numerical modelling. the department of metallurgy together with the department of physical chemistry and theory of technological processes are involved in the regional materials science and technology centre project, research program no. 6. in this project, these workplaces created the laboratory for modelling of processes in the liquid and solid phases. the newly purchased equipment and existing human and material laboratory facilities will provide new opportunities for conducting applied research not only in the field of transfer and homogenization processes in the ladle.
molecular_biology	type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (prrs) virus (prrsv) was first isolated in korea in 1994. the commercial prrs modified live vaccine (ingelvac (r) prrs mlv, boehringer ingelheim vetmedica inc., st. joseph, missouri, usa) based on type 2 prrsv, was first licensed for use in 3- to 18-week-old pigs in korea in 1996. the objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of this 20 year old commercial prrs modified live vaccine (mlv) against two recent prrsv isolates. two genetically distant type 2 prrsv strains (snuvr150004 for lineage 1 and snuvr150324 for lineage 5), isolated in 2015, were used as challenge virus. regardless of the challenge virus, vaccination of pigs effectively reduced the level of viremia, the lung lesions, and of the prrsv antigen within the lung lesions. the induction of virus specific interferon-gamma secreting cells by the prrs vaccine produced a protective immune response, leading to the reduction of prrsv viremia. there were no significant differences in efficacy against the two recently isolated viruses by the prrs mlv based on virological results, immunological responses, and pathological outcomes. this study demonstrates that the prrs mlv used in this study is still effective against recently isolated heterologous type 2 prrsv strains even after 20 years of use in over 35 million pigs (c) 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
thermodynamics	we revisit the equilibrium one-dimensional phi(4) model from the dynamical systems point of view. we find an infinite number of periodic orbits which are computationally stable. at the same time some of the orbits are found to exhibit positive lyapunov exponents! the periodic orbits confine every particle in a periodic chain to trace out either the same or a mirror-image trajectory in its two-dimensional phase space. these ""computationally stable"" sets of pairs of single-particle orbits are either symmetric or antisymmetric to the very last computational bit. in such a periodic chain the odd-numbered and even numbered particles' coordinates and momenta are either identical or differ only in sign. ""positive lyapunov exponents"" can and do result if an infinitesimal perturbation breaking a perfect two-dimensional antisymmetry is introduced so that the motion expands into a four-dimensional phase space. in that extended space a positive exponent results. we formulate a standard initial condition for the investigation of the microcanonical chaotic number dependence of the model. we speculate on the uniqueness of the model 's chaotic sea and on the connection of such collections of deterministic and time-reversible states to the second law of thermodynamics.

southern_blotting	the life cycle of seaweed laminaria japonica involves a generation alternation between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophte. the expression of foreign genes in sporophte has been proved. in this research, the recombinant expression in gametophyte was investigated by particle bombardment with the rt-pa gene encoding the recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (reteplase), which is a thrombolytic agent for acute myocardial infarction (ami). transgenic gametophytes were selected by their resistance to herbicide phosphiothricin (ppt), and proliferated in an established bubble column photo-bioreactor. according to the results from quantitative elisa, southern blotting, and fibrin agarose plate assay (fapa) for bioactivity, it was showed that the rt-pa gene had been integrated into the genome of gametophytes of l. japonica, and the expression product showed the expected bioactivity, implying the proper post-transcript modification in haploid gametophyte.
machine_design	cross-sectional ovalization of thin-walled circular steel tube because of large plastic bending, also known as the brazier effect, usually occurs during the initial stage of tube 's continuous rotary straightening process. the amount of ovalization, defined as maximal cross section flattening, is an important technical parameter in tube 's straightening process to control tube 's bending deformation and prevent buckling. however, for the lack of special analytical model, the maximal section flattening was determined in accordance with the specified charts developed by experienced operators on the basis of experimental data; thus, it was inevitable that the localized buckling might occur during some actual straightening operations. new normal strain component formulas were derived based on the thin shell theory. then, strain energy of thin-walled tube (per unit length) was obtained using the elastic-plastic theory. a rational model for predicting the maximal section flattening of the thin-walled circular steel tube under its straightening process was presented by the principle of minimum potential energy. the new model was validated by experiments and numerical simulations. the results show that the new model agrees well with the experiments and the numerical simulations with error of less than 10%. this new model was expected to find its potential application in thin-walled steel tube straightening machine design.
polymerase_chain_reaction	human bone marrow stromal cells (hbmscs) may contribute to the growth of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki)-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml). however, there are certain differences in biology between cml and philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ph+ all). little is known about the role and mechanism of hbmscs on the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all. the current study co-cultured hbmscs with the tki-resistant sup-b15. next, the proliferation of sup-b15 was detected using a cell counting kit-8. additionally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression of the associated genes and proteins. the present study explores the role and mechanism of hbmscs on the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all. the current study showed that hbmscs promoted the proliferation of tki-resistant ph+ all. this was shown by the increase in cells in the s+ g2-m phase of the cell cycle. it was also found that the expression of cyclins a, c, d1 and e was increased. apoptosis was inhibited through upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes [b-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) and bcl-extra large] and downregulation of apoptotic genes (bcl-xs, bcl-2-associated x protein, and caspases 3, 7 and 9). expression of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr)-abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (abl) gene, wnt5a, and wnt signaling pathway-associated genes (glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, beta-catenin, e-cadherin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and transcription factors (c-myc, ephrin type-b2, fibroblast growth factor 20 and matrix metalloproteinase 7) was also increased. furthermore, the expression of drug resistance genes (low-density lipoprotein receptor, multidrug resistanceasso-ciated protein and multi-drug resistance gene) was increased and the expression of anti-oncogenes (death-associated protein kinase and interferon regulatory factor-1) was decreased. it was concluded that hbmscs promote the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all by these aforementioned mechanisms. therefore, targeting hbmscs may be a promising approach for preventing the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all.
strength_of_materials	the objective of this study is the characterization of the fretting fatigue strength in a hydrogen gas environment. the test materials were a low alloy steel scm435h, super alloy a286 and two kinds of austenitic stainless steels, sus304 and sus316l the test was performed in hydrogen gas at 0.12 mpa absolute pressure. the purity of the hydrogen gas was 99.9999%. the fretting fatigue limit was defined by the fretting fatigue strength at 30 million cycles. for all materials, the fretting fatigue strength in the hydrogen gas environment increased in the short-life region. however, the fretting fatigue strength in the hydrogen gas environment decreased in the long-life region when exceeding 10 million cycles except for scm435h, while there was no reduction in the fretting fatigue strength in air between 10 and 30 million cycles. the reduction rate was 18% for a286, 24% for sus304 and 7% for sus316l the tangential force coefficient in the hydrogen gas environment increased when compared to that in air. it can be estimated that this increase is one of the causes of the reduced fretting fatigue strength found in a hydrogen gas environment. in order to discuss the extension of the fretting fatigue life in hydrogen gas observed at the stress level above the fretting fatigue limit in air, continuous measurement of the fretting fatigue crack propagation was performed in a hydrogen gas environment using the direct current potential drop method. as a result, it was found that the extension of the fretting fatigue life was caused by the delay in the start of the stable crack propagation.

computer-aided_design	to analyse the accuracy of maxillary positioning after le fort i osteotomy, we retrospectively assessed the outcome in three patients (mean (range) age 40 (21 60) years) who had been treated with patient-specific cad-cam osteosynthesis plates as part of a bimaxillary osteotomy. virtual surgical planning in each case was based on cone-beam computed tomography (ct) (simplant (r) o&o, dentsply implants nv, kessel-lo, belgium), and patient-specific cad-cam drilling guides and osteosynthesis plates were produced for maxillary positioning and fixation. we evaluated the accuracy of the placement by virtual comparison of the preoperative and postoperative images. in the upper dentition, postoperative analysis showed a mean (sd) deviation of 1.3 (1.4) mm from the preoperative plan. the method enables accurate placement of the maxilla, independent of the condyle or mandible, without the need for extraoral reference points.

enzymology	macrolide-pipecolate natural products, such as rapamycin (1) and fk-506 (2), are renowned modulators of fk506-binding proteins (fkbps). the nocardiopsins, from nocardiopsis sp. cmb-m0232, are the newest members of this structural class. here, the biosynthetic pathway for nocardiopsins a-d (4-7) is revealed by cloning, sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses of the nsn gene cluster. in vitro evaluation of recombinant nsnl revealed that this lysine cyclodeaminase catalyzes the conversion of l-lysine into the l-pipecolic acid incorporated into 4 and 5. bioinformatic analyses supported the conjecture that a linear nocardiopsin precursor is equipped with the hydroxy group required for macrolide closure in a previously unobserved manner by employing a p450 epoxidase (nsnf) and limonene epoxide hydrolase homologue (nsng). the nsn cluster also encodes candidates for tetrahydrofuran group biosynthesis. the nocardiopsin pathway provides opportunities for engineering of fkbp-binding metabolites and for probing new enzymology in nature 's polyketide tailoring arsenal.
thermodynamics	textbooks state that the lift, drag, and thrust coefficients cl, cd, and ct, are numbers that must be dimensionally proper (i.e., dimensionless) for their use in comparing different data sets. this paper posits that for the meaningful comparison of different data sets, numbers must be dimensionally and physically proper. the physical propriety is satisfied by expressing the number as a ratio of work and the energy available at an aerodynamic system during the generation of lift, drag, or thrust. the aerodynamic systems addressed in this paper are aircraft, propellers and lift rotors, cylinders in magnus effect, and flapping wings. this paper introduces the normalized lift, eta(l), normalized drag eta(d), and normalized thrust, eta(t), numbers that are dimensionally and physically proper and can evaluate the ability of generating lift, drag, and thrust of these aforementioned systems and compare this ability between different systems. these numbers are shown to act like the thermal efficiency. in thermodynamics as they represent the ratio of work exerted onto the surrounding flowfield and the kinetic energy available at the system, are associated with a maximum value eta(max) (that may exceed 1) and can be read on a stand-alone basis. their common mathematical format facilitates crosspollination between engineering, biomechanics, and biology. a numerical calculation of the normalized lift eta(l) of the blades of the record-breaking quadcopter aerovelo atlas is presented and compared with its lift coefficient cl as calculated by the aerovelo group.

fluid_mechanics	fluid-structure interaction (fsi) analysis of a full-scale hydraulic arresting gear used to retard the forward motion of an aircraft landing on an aircraft-carrier deck is performed. the simulations make use of the recently developed core and special-purpose fsi techniques for other problem classes, specialized to the present application. a recently proposed interactive geometry modeling and parametric design platform for isogeometric analysis (iga) is directly employed to create the arresting gear model, and illustrates a natural application of iga to this problem class. the fluid mechanics and fsi simulation results are reported in terms of the arresting-gear rotor loads and blade structural deformation and vibration. excellent agreement is achieved with the experimental results for the arresting gear design simulated in this work.

computer-aided_design	purpose: the aim of this study was to determine the stability of computer-aided design and manufacturing (cad/cam) and prefabricated abutment by measuring removal torque before and after cyclic loading. materials and methods: three types of fixture and 2 types of abutments were used. removable torque was measured after cyclic loading for 5000 cycles between 25 and 250 n for each group. the same procedure was performed twice. results: first, removal torque values (newton centimeter) were measured for stock versus custom abutments as follows: group 1: 27.17 versus 26.67, group 2: 26.27 versus 26.33, and group 3: 37.33 versus 36.67. second removal torque values (newton centimeter) were also measured: group 1: 23 versus 23.5, group 2: 22.5 versus 22.33, and group 3: 32.67 versus 32.5. there was no significant difference between the stock and custom abutments in either the first or second removal torque values and also no significant difference among initial tightening torque, first or second removal torque (p >0.05). conclusion: with precise control of cad/cam abutments, good screw joint stability can be achieved.
immunology	compelling evidences point out a crucial role for extracellular nucleotides such as adenosine triphosphate (atp) during inflammatory conditions. once released into the extracellular space, atp modulates migration, maturation and function of various inflammatory cells via activating of purinergic receptors of the p2y- and p2x- family. p2rx4 is an atp-guided ion channel expressed on structural cells such as alveolar epithelial and smooth muscle cells as well as inflammatory cells including macrophages, dendritic cells (dcs) and t cells. p2rx4 has been shown to interact with p2rx7 and promote nlrp3 inflammasome activation. although p2rx7 has already been implicated in allergic asthma, the role of p2rx4 in airway inflammation has not been elucidated yet. therefore, we used a selective pharmacological antagonist and genetic ablation to investigate the role of p2rx4 in an ovalbumin (ova) driven model of allergen-induced airway inflammation (aai). both, p2rx4 antagonist 5-bdbd treatment and p2rx4 deficiency resulted in an alleviated broncho alveolar lavage fluid eosinophilia, peribronchial inflammation, th2 cytokine production and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. furthermore, p2rx4-deficient bone marrow derived dcs (bmdcs) showed a reduced il-1 beta production in response to atp accompanied by a decreased p2rx7 expression and attenuated th2 priming capacity compared to wild type (wt) bmdcs in vitro. moreover, mice adoptively transferred with p2rx4-deficient bmdcs exhibit a diminished aai in vivo. in conclusion our data suggests that p2rx4-signaling contributes to aai pathogenesis by regulating dc mediated th2 cell priming via modulating il-1 beta secretion and selective p2rx4-antagonists might be a new therapeutic option for allergic asthma.
fluid_mechanics	central aortic pressure (cap) can be used to predict cardiovascular structural damage and cardiovascular events, and the development of simple, well-validated and non-invasive methods for cap waveforms estimation is critical to facilitate the routine clinical applications of cap. existing widely applied methods, such as generalized transfer function (gtf-cap) method and n-point moving average (npma-cap) method, are based on clinical practices, and lack a mathematical foundation. those methods also have inherent drawback that there is no personalisation, and missing individual aortic characteristics. to overcome this pitfall, we present a personalized-model-based central aortic pressure estimation method (pm-cap)in this paper. this pm-cap has a mathematical foundation: a human aortic network model is proposed which is developed based on viscous fluid mechanics theory and could be personalized conveniently. via measuring the pulse wave at the proximal and distal ends of the radial artery, the least square method is then proposed to estimate patient-specific circuit parameters. thus the central aortic pulse wave can be obtained via calculating the transfer function between the radial artery and central aorta. an invasive validation study with 18 subjects comparing pm-cap with direct aortic root pressure measurements during percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention was carried out at the beijing hospital. the experimental results show better performance of the pm-cap method compared to the gtf-cap method and npma-cap method, which illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

human_metabolism	background: the amounts of vitamin a that are metabolically derived from specific carotene-containing foods are largely unknown. objective: we sought to develop an improved method for estimating the metabolic vitamin a potential of provitamin a carotenoids by using [h-2(4)]retinyl acetate (d(4)-ra) as an extrinsic reference standard. design: healthy subjects consumed a standardized test meal containing 6 mg beta -carotene as either raw carrot or spinach, either 20 or 1 g added fat, and 6.0 mu mol d(4)-ra. concentrations of unlabeled (d(0)) retinyl esters (re), labeled (d(4)) re, and carotenoids in the plasma triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein fraction (d<1.006 kg/l) were determined in serial blood samples with hplc and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. baseline-corrected areas under the curve for d(0)-re, d(4)-re, and carotenoids were calculated, and the masses of absorbed do-retinol and carotenes were estimated assuming 80% absorption of the d(4)-ra reference dose. results: in trials with ample (20 g) fat (n=6), 74% of the 6 mg beta -carotene ingested was taken up as beta -carotene plus re with 0.3 +/-0.1 mg as retinol. test meals without carotenes yielded no beta -carotene or d(0)-re response and there was no effect of treatment (either fat amount or vegetable, n=6) on the mean d(4)-re area under the curve. the lower-than-expected vitamin a yields were attributed to poor intestinal uptake rather than to low conversion of beta -carotene to re. conclusion: the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein and d(4)-ra method, which controls for variation in chylomicron kinetics in vivo and re recovery during analysis, is useful for obtaining quantitative estimates of the vitamin a potential of single meals.
southern_blotting	arginine decarboxylase (adc), one of the enzymes responsible for putrescine (put) biosynthesis, has been shown to be implicated in stress response. in the current paper attempts were made to clone and characterize a gene encoding adc from peach (prunus persica (l) batsch, 'akatsuki'). rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) gave rise to a full-length adc cdna (ppadc) with a complete open reading frame of 2178 bp, encoding a 725 amino acid polypeptide. homology search and sequence multi-alignment demonstrated that the deduced ppadc protein sequence shared a high identity with adcs from other plants, including several highly conservative motifs and amino acids. southern blotting indicated that ppadc existed in peach genome as a single gene. expression levels of ppadc in different tissues of peach (p. persica 'akatsuki') were spatially and developmentally regulated. treatment of peach shoots from 'mochizuki' with exogenous 5 mm put, an indirect product of adc, remarkably induced accumulation of ppadc mrna. transcripts of ppadc in peach leaves from 'mochizuki' were quickly induced, either transiently or continuously, in response to dehydration, high salinity (200 mm nacl), low temperature (4 degrees c) and heavy metal (150 mu m cdcl(2)), but repressed by high temperature 37 degrees c) during a 2-day treatment, which changed in an opposite direction when the stresses were otherwise removed with the exception of cdcl(2) treatment. in addition, steady-state of ppadc mrna could be also transiently up-regulated by abscisic acid (aba) in 'mochizuki' leaves. all of these, taken together, suggest that ppadc is a stress-responsive gene and can be considered as a potential target that is genetically manipulated so as to create novel germplasms with enhanced stress tolerance in the future.

immunology	while an understanding of the structure and function of a generically described immune system is essential in contemporary biomedicine, it is clear that a one-size-fits-all approach applied across multiple species is fraught with contradictions and inconsistencies. nevertheless, the breakthroughs achieved in immunology following the application of observations in murine systems to that of man have been pivotal in the advancement of biology and human medicine. however, as additional species have been used to further address biologic and safety assessment questions relative to the structure and function of the immune system, it has become clear that there are differences across species, gender, age and strain that must be considered. the meaningfulness of these differences must be determined on a case-by-case basis. this review article attempts to collect, consolidate and discuss some of these species differences thereby aiding in the accurate placement of new observations in a proper immunobiological and immunopathological perspective.
genetics	backgroundseveral reports found a relationship between increased serum lead levels and the risk for essential tremor (et), especially in carriers of the minor allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) rs1800435 in the aminolevulinate dehydratase (alad) gene, which is involved in the synthesis of haem groups. our group reported decreased risk for et in carriers of the minor alleles of the rs2071746 and rs1051308 snps in the haem-oxygenases 1 and 2 (hmox1 and hmox2), respectively, involved in haem metabolism. we analysed whether alad rs1800435 alone and their interactions with the four common snps in the hmox1 and hmox2 genes are associated with the risk for et. materials and methodswe analysed the genotype and allele variants frequencies of alad rs1800435 in 202 patients with familial et and 218 healthy controls using a taqman method. we also analysed the role of the interaction between alad rs1800435 and the hmox1 rs2071746, hmox1 rs2071747, hmox2 rs2270363 and hmox2 rs1051308 with the risk of developing et. resultsthe frequencies of genotype and allelic variants of alad rs1800435 did not differ significantly between patients with et and controls, and were not influenced by gender. subjects carrying the alad rs1800435cc genotype (wild-type) and the hmox2 rs1051308gg genotype or the hmox2 rs1051308g allele had significantly decreased risk for et. conclusionsthese results suggest that the alad rs1800435 snp is not related with the risk for et, but its interaction with the hmox2 rs1051308 snp could be weakly associated with the risk for this disease.
computer-aided_design	transient operations are very crucial for high power insulated-gate bipolar transistor modules, because high current and voltage are applied during this period for several microseconds. therefore, the ability for doubly fed induction generator (dfig) variable speed wind turbine power converters to withstand abnormal conditions is strictly imperative in order to achieve its lifetime specifications and also fulfil the grid codes. this study presents a new control scheme for dfig wind turbine having parallel interleaved converters (pic) configuration and a series dynamic braking resistor (sdbr) connected at its stator side. interleaving the wind turbine converters in parallel configuration could help to increase the current capability, while the sdbr helps in post fault recovery of the wind turbine. the coordinated control analysis of the scheme was implemented in power system computer aided design and electromagnetic transient including dc simulation environment for a severe three-phase to ground fault. results obtained were compared with the conventional dc chopper and crowbar rotor circuit protection scheme for the wind turbine. a better performance of the wind turbine variables were achieved using the proposed control scheme of the pic and sdbr because the space vector modulation of the pic results in maximum value of the change in common mode voltage, leading to improved switched output voltage of the voltage source converter leg.
manufacturing_engineering	while serving a vital role in the undergraduate curriculum, capstone design courses face a variety of challenges. these challenges include lack of student value & utilization of course objectives & assessment tools, sponsor retention & funding issues, and large instructional demands. many of these challenges may be addressed by placing a larger and more genuine emphasis on assessing the product of the design project, not only the process by which the design occurs. oregon state university 's (osu) mechanical, industrial, and manufacturing engineering capstone course currently organizes, manages, and evaluates capstone projects using the house of quality (hoq). in general, the hoq is a tool used to relate project requirements to design performance specifications. additionally, at osu the hoq serves as (i) a contract between students, sponsors, course instructors, and faculty advisers detailing exactly what is required from the design project, (ii) a guiding tool to allow students to self-monitor their progress throughout the course, and (iii) an objective means of evaluating the students' performance in terms of the product produced by their capstone design projects. this paper describes the osu course, introduces the hoq, and presents a time-line of the implementation of product assessment at osu. key changes are shown during the move from a purely process based assessment framework to the current state where 50% of total points in the design implementation term of the capstone course are awarded based on the student design team accomplishing design product metrics per sponsor defined design requirements. in addition, the authors report on the course instructor 's perception regarding the effect of implementing the hoq in the osu capstone course. finally, conclusions and implications of the work are presented.
molecular_biology	lesch-nyhan syndrome (lns) is an x-linked recessive disorder of purine metabolism caused by a mutation in xq26.2-q26.3 (omim 308000.0004). the presence of the diagnostic triad, i.e. signs of self-injurious behavior (sib) and results of pedigree analysis and novel molecular biology & genetic testing, confirms the diagnosis of lns. with a level of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 (hprt1) enzyme activity < 2%, patients develop neurological, neurocognitive, and neuromotor symptoms along with sib. described here is a case of 4-year-old boy who was diagnosed with lns. the boy displayed sib, i.e. biting of the lips and fingers, and he had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis caused by lns.
manufacturing_engineering	production management should be evaluate in terms of performance, quantity and quality. a balance between different, dynamic and complex indicators of the production is necessary to engineers, production managers in order to capture correct decisions in very short time, according with the actual socio-economic system. for this reason, this paper presents a new approach of the performance indicators of production management, analysing a mechanical manufacturing system. the paper focuses on cross-boundary, involving classical manufacturing engineering and investigational domain, in close proximity the study employ the indicators to evaluate production results, production optimization and performances in this multifaceted field.
cell_biology	in the past decade mass spectrometry-based proteomics has greatly contributed to shaping our knowledge about saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria, from the initial identification of novel essential components in purified protein complexes, to the actual characterization of the mitochondrial proteome, the specific analysis of mitochondrial subcompartment proteomes, and the study of regulatory mechanisms that govern mitochondrial homeostasis. here, we provide an overview of relevant mitochondrial proteome studies and furthermore discuss future possibilities how proteomics will further improve our existing understanding of mitochondria. although mitochondria were the first organelles that have been intensively studied using proteomics, indeed the recent progress and development of more powerful and sensitive methods, instrumentation and data analysis strategies indicate that we are only beginning to exploit the full potential of mitochondrial proteomics and its possibilities to decipher cell biology. beside mere (quantitative) inventory under different conditions, this will for instance include studying the role of multiple post-translational modifications in mitochondrial homeostasis as well as the system-wide mapping of protein-protein complexes and protein-lipid interactions.

fluid_mechanics	a simple new device for dry separation of fine particulate matter from bulk soil samples is presented here. it consists of a stainless steel tube along which a nitrogen flow is imposed, resulting in the displacement of particles. taking into account particle transport, fluid mechanics, and soil sample composition, a tube 6-m long, with a 0.04-m diameter, was found best adapted for pm10 separation. the device rapidly produced several milligrams of particulate matter, on which chemical extractions with edta were subsequently performed to study the kinetic parameters of extractable metals. new caledonian mining soils were chosen here, as a case-study. although the easily extracted metal pool represents only 0.5-6.4 % of the total metal content for the elements studied (ni, co, mn), the total concentrations are extremely high. this pool is therefore far from negligible, and can be troublesome in the environment. this dry technique for fine particle separation from bulk parent soil eliminates the metal-leaching risks inherent in wet filtration and should therefore ensure safe assessment of environmental quality in fine-textured, metal-contaminated soils.
immunology	background: correct diagnosis of cefazolin hypersensitivity is not straightforward, mainly because of the absence of in vitro tests and uncertainties concerning the optimal cefazolin concentration for skin testing. cross-reactivity studies suggest cefazolin hypersensitivity to be a selective hypersensitivity. objective: the first objective was to confirm that the application of a higher than 2 mg/ml test concentration could increase skin test sensitivity. a second part aimed at investigating the cross-reactivity between cefazolin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. methods: a total of 66 patients referred to our clinic after experiencing perioperative anaphylaxis, and exposed to cefazolin, underwent skin testing with cefazolin up to 20 mg/ml. patients exhibiting a positive skin test with cefazolin had a panel of skin tests with other beta-lactams and, if indicated, graded drug challenges to study cross-reactivity. results: increasing skin test concentration from the recommended 2 mg/ml to 20 mg/ml identified an additional 7 of 19 (27%) patients, who would otherwise have displayed negative skin testing. the concentration was proven nonirritating in 30 cefazolin-exposed control individuals in whom an alternative culprit for perioperative anaphylaxis was identified. graded challenge testing, after negative skin testing, displayed that all patients tolerated alternative beta-lactam antibiotics (ie, amoxicillin, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems). of them, 11 individuals also tolerated an alternative cephalosporin, suggesting that cefazolin hypersensitivity (generally) is a selective allergy. conclusions: increasing cefazolin concentration for skin tests up to 20 mg/ml benefits the sensitivity of diagnosis. furthermore, our data confirm that cefazolin hypersensitivity seems to be a selective allergy with good tolerance to other b-lactam antibiotics.

machine_design	this paper proposes a novel dual-consequent-pole vernier memory machine (dcp-vmm) featuring alternatively arranged ndfeb and low coercive-force (lcf) magnet poles on the rotating and stationary sides, respectively. due to the presence of lcf magnets that can be repetitively magnetized or demagnetized via a simple current pulse, the extra-high torque density at low-speed, and excellent high-efficient high-speed flux-weakening performance can be simultaneously realized. the configuration and operating principle, as well as the design considerations of the proposed machine are introduced, respectively. the finite element method (fem) coupled with a nonlinear analytical hysteresis model for lcf magnets is employed to investigate the electromagnetic performance of the machine, which verifies the effectiveness of machine design and the feasibility as a competent candidate for automotive applications.
northern_blotting	analysis of microarray data obtained by comparing gene expression between 2-week-old infant and 7-week-old mature sd rat testes revealed novel targets involved in tumor suppression. reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting indicated that tusc3 gene expression was upregulated in the normal maturing testis and prostate and other organs such as the cerebrum and ovary. tumor suppressor candidate 3 protein expression was detected in these same organs at a size of about 40 kda, in accord with the predicted molecular size. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that mrna and protein localization were prevalent in the testis spermatocytes and interstitial cells such as the leydig cells, as well as prostate epithelial cells. these data suggest that tusc3 is deeply involved in spermatogenesis in the testis, inducing sperm differentiation and maturation, and plays a role in normal prostate development and tumor suppression.
cell_biology	this mini-review highlights the photophysical properties of fluorescent molecular logic gates responsive to acids and oxidants, particularly those developed in our laboratory the past few years. the review pays tribute to earlier developments that lay the foundation for this emerging class of molecules. the logic gates incorporate design concepts based on photoinduced electron transfer from the cross-fertilization of the fluorophore-spacer-receptor and fluorophore-spacer-electron-donor formats. the molecular logic gates explored in detail consist of anthracene and/or naphthalimide fluorophores, while the receptor and electron-donor are typically alkyl amines and ferrocene, respectively. this emerging class of molecule has numerous probable uses, most notably, in corrosion science, geochemistry, molecular cell biology and biomedical diagnostics.
hydraulics	the boiling water reactors (bwrs) are inherently nonlinear physical system, as any other physical system. the reactivity feedback, which is caused by both moderator density and temperature, allows several effects reflecting the nonlinear behavior of the system. stability analyses of bwr is done with a simplified, reduced order model, which couples point reactor kinetics with thermal hydraulics of the reactor core. the linear stability analysis of the bwr for steady states shows that at a critical value of bifurcation parameter (i.e. feedback gain), hopf bifurcation occurs. these stable and unstable domains of parametric spaces cannot be predicted by linear stability analysis because the stability of system does not include only stability of the steady states. the stability of other dynamics of the system such as limit cycles must be included in study of stability. the nonlinear stability analysis (i.e. bifurcation analysis) becomes an indispensable component of stability analysis in this scenario. hopf bifurcation, which occur with one free parameter, is studied here and it formulates birth of limit cycles. the excitation of these limit cycles makes the system bistable in the case of subcritical bifurcation whereas stable limit cycles continues in an unstable region for supercritical bifurcation. the distinction between subcritical and supercritical hopf is done by two parameter analysis (i.e. codimension-2 bifurcation). in this scenario, generalized hopf bifurcation (gh) takes place, which separates sub and supercritical hopf bifurcation. the various types of bifurcation such as limit point bifurcation of limit cycle (lpc), period doubling bifurcation of limit cycles (pd) and neimark-sacker bifurcation of limit cycles (ns) have been identified with the floquet multipliers. the lpc manifests itself as the region of bistability whereas chaotic region exist because of cascading of pd. this region of bistability and chaotic solutions are drawn on the various parametric bifurcation diagrams (c) 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
cell_biology	the tongue is an elaborate complex of heterogeneous tissues with taste organs of diverse embryonic origins. the lingual taste organs are papillae, composed of an epithelium that includes specialized taste buds, the basal lamina, and a lamina propria core with matrix molecules, fibroblasts, nerves, and vessels. because taste organs are dynamic in cell biology and sensory function, homeostasis requires tight regulation in specific compartments or niches. recently, the hedgehog (hh) pathway has emerged as an essential regulator that maintains lingual taste papillae, taste bud and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and neurophysiological function. activating or suppressing hh signaling, with genetic models or pharmacological agents used in cancer treatments, disrupts taste papilla and taste bud integrity and can eliminate responses from taste nerves to chemical stimuli but not to touch or temperature. understanding hh regulation of taste organ homeostasis contributes knowledge about the basic biology underlying taste disruptions in patients treated with hh pathway inhibitors.
internal_combustion_engine	with urging needs to decrease the fuel consumption and environment pollution, energy saving and emission reduction technologies in the ice (internal combustion engine) industry are developed. a thermal os/orc (oil storage/organic rankine cycle) system was constructed and preliminarily tested for whr (waste heat recovery) from exhaust gas of a 240 kw diesel engine. the heat balance test of diesel engine without os/orc was conducted first to investigate the varying property of exhaust gas, then the os/orc system was tested to show its ability against high temperature and variation of exhaust gas. the results show that thermal oil effectively dropped the working temperature of organic fluid to less than 210 degrees c, which is much lower than the decomposition temperature of many organic fluids. also, thermal oil brought a significant inertia to the response of system which could be positive against the variation of engine condition. in order to learn more about the operating characteristics of os/orc system, the impact of important parameters on each other was investigated quantitatively as well as on the performance of os/orc system. the results show that within the given range, higher evaporating pressure can obviously improve the performance of os/orc while the impact of superheat is nearly negligible.

machine_design	in this work a design methodology for synchronous reluctance motors (synrm) is presented. the methodology is focused on maximizing the average torque but also takes into account the torque ripple. the presented methodology parameterizes the rotor in function of certain design variables which define the arrangement of the iron segments and flux barriers. the change in one of these design variables involves a change in the rotor geometry, resulting in a new machine design. the methodology is based in the systematically change of the design variables. the machine electromagnetic behavior and the performance of the motor is evaluated with finite elements models (fem).

enzymology	among all rnas, trna exhibits the largest number and the widest variety of post-transcriptional modifications. modifications within the anticodon stem loop, mainly at the wobble position and purine-37, collectively contribute to stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing, maintain the translational reading frame, facilitate the engagement of the ribosomal decoding site and enable translocation of trna from the a-site to the p-site of the ribosome. modifications at the wobble uridine (u34) of trnas reading two degenerate codons ending in purine are complex and result from the activity of two multi-enzyme pathways, the iscs-mnma and mnmeg pathways, which independently work on positions 2 and 5 of the u34 pyrimidine ring, respectively, and from a third pathway, controlled by trml (yibk), that modifies the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose. mnmeg is the only common pathway to all the mentioned trnas, and involves the gtp- and fad-dependent activity of the mnmeg complex and, in some cases, the activity of the bifunctional enzyme mnmc. the escherichia coli mnmeg complex catalyzes the incorporation of an aminomethyl group into the c5 atom of u34 using methylene-tetrahydrofolate and glycine or ammonium as donors. the reaction requires gtp hydrolysis, probably to assemble the active site of the enzyme or to carry out substrate recognition. inactivation of the evolutionarily conserved mnmeg pathway produces a pleiotropic phenotype in bacteria and mitochondrial dysfunction in human cell lines. while the iscs-mnma pathway and the mnma-mediated thiouridylation reaction are relatively well understood, we have limited information on the reactions mediated by the mnmeg, mnmc and trml enzymes and on the precise role of proteins mnme and mnmg in the mnmeg complex activity. this review summarizes the present state of knowledge on these pathways and what we still need to know, with special emphasis on the mnmeg pathway.

internal_combustion_engine	there are increasing pressures upon the automotive industry to reduce harmful emissions as well as meeting the key objective of enhanced fuel efficiency, while improving or retaining the engine output power. the losses in an internal combustion (ic) engine can be divided into thermal and parasitic as well as due to gas leakage because of untoward compression ring motions. frictional losses are particularly of concern at low engine speeds, assuming a greater share of the overall losses. piston-cylinder system accounts for nearly half of all the frictional losses. loss of sealing functionality of the ring pack can also contribute significantly to power losses as well as exacerbating harmful emissions. the dynamics of compression ring is inexorably linked to its tribological performance, a link which has not been made in many reported analyses. a fundamental understanding of the interplay between the top compression ring three-dimensional elastodynamic behavior, its sealing function and contribution to the overall frictional losses is long overdue. this paper provides a comprehensive integrated transient elastotribodynamic analysis of the compression ring to cylinder liner and its retaining piston groove lands' conjunctions, an approach not hitherto reported in the literature. the methodology presented aims to aid the piston ring design evaluation processes. realistic engine running conditions are used which constitute international drive cycle testing conditions.
hydraulics	steam injector (si) is known as passive jet pump and heat exchanging device which operates without external power source or mechanical machineries. it utilizes direct contact condensation heat transfer between steam and water-jet as a driving mechanism of the operation and is capable of discharging sub cooled water at higher pressure than the inlet fluids pressure. in addition, it has an excellent heat transfer capability, more than 1000 times that of shell and tube heat exchanger. in the present study, thermal hydraulics characteristics of the water-jet-centered supersonic si system were investigated from both experimental and analytical approaches. the si body was manufactured with stainless steel equipped with overflow port. the water injection nozzle was designed with shaft-driving mechanism to freely adjust the axial location of the water nozzle and steam inlet cross sectional area. high pressure steam was supplied to the si from once-through boiler, which is capable of supplying saturated steam at the maximum pressure of 0.63 mpa for the current test facility. water jet was injected at mass flow rate of 0.4-0.8 kg/s. pressure and temperature measurements were conducted at inlet and outlet of the steam injector system as well as at the overflow port to investigate the operation characteristics of the si. results showed the water-jet centered si 's promising functionality as a passive coolant injection in view of its quick-start up, operable condition limits, discharge pressure and heat transfer capabilities at current inlet conditions. in addition, obtained experimental results were compared with analytical model to assess the predictive capability of discharge pressure value and reasonable agreement was obtained.

northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are a class of non-protein-coding small rnas. considering the conservation of many mirna genes in different plant genomes, the identification of mirnas from non-model organisms is both practicable and instrumental in addressing mirna-guided gene regulation. citrus is an important staple fruit tree, and publicly available expressed sequence tag (est) database for citrus are increasing. however, until now, little has been known about mirna in citrus. in this study, 27 known mirnas from arabidopsis were searched against citrus est databases for mirna precursors, of which 13 searched precursor sequences could form fold-back structures similar with those of arabidopsis. the ubiquitous expression of those 13 citrus micrornas and other 13 potential citrus mirnas could be detected in citrus leaf, young shoot, flower, fruit and root by northern blotting, and some of them showed differential expression in different tissues. based on the fact that mirnas exhibit perfect or nearly perfect complementarity with their target sequences, a total of 41 potential targets were identified for 15 citrus mirnas. the majority of the targets are transcription factors that play important roles in citrus development, including leaf, shoot, and root development. additionally, some other target genes appear to play roles in diverse physiological processes. four target genes have been experimentally verified by detection of the mirna-mediated mrna cleavage in poncirus trifoliate. overall, this study in the identification and characterization of mirnas in citrus can initiate further study on citrus mirna regulation mechanisms, and it can help us to know more about the important roles of mirnas in citrus.
machine_design	this paper proposes a combined numerical and analytical approach for magnetic vibration analysis of a new dc-excited multitoothed switched reluctance (msr) machine. first, the machine design is artfully to incorporate the dc-excited winding into the msr topology, hence breeding a new flux controllable, high-torque, low-torque ripple, and doubly salient magnetless machine. then, the finite-element-method is used to calculate the machine force and torque. a series of analytical equations are formulated to calculate the magnetic vibration parameters of the proposed machine. the analysis process and the corresponding results are given to verify the validity of the proposed approach for magnetic vibration analysis of the new machine.
thermodynamics	this paper presents the results of research conducted in the field of confinement effects in ultrathin dielectric films. method of choice is the method of green 's functions which proved to be a very powerful tool for theoretical research in solid state physics. among many other properties of materials, such as optical, conductive, etc. with this method it is possible to obtain critical values of boundary parameters corresponding to all transitions from bulk to localized exciton states. this research is valid for four layered crystalline film, since that type of ultrathin structure was the object of research. conditions for occurrence of one, two, three, or even four localized states have been found and analyzed and regions with equal number of localized states have been defined. this corresponds to the process of reconstruction of the energy spectra of excitons in quasi 2d nanostructures with respect to those in corresponding bulk-structures.
machine_design	the study involved performance evaluation of a multistage jatropha fruit shelling machine (pi2015701163) which is used to produce jatropha kernels (oil-rich nucleus) with higher purity by removing both the outer shells of fruits and husks (seeds' coating). the reduction of shells and husks together, which is not commonly practised at the moment, can improve oil yield and quality during oil extraction process in biodiesel production. the shelling machine consists of two cracking unit with each having different roller clearance for different stage of decortications. every roller was featured with male threads on the surface. the male threads in different rotating directions and speeds can provoke more shearing effect onto the loaded jatropha fruits. the machine design also deploys multistage separation mechanisms consisting of vibratory sieve and blowers for a purpose to produce cleaner kernels. the designed machine has been tested at different blower air speeds and fruit moisture contents. the optimal air speed and fruit moisture content were found to be 9.8 +/- 0.4 m s(-1) and around 5.7% w.b. respectively, where the husks could be removed without causing high kernel loss. the overall results show that the designed machine at the optimal conditions was able to remove 99% of shells and 52% of husks while controlling the kernel loss at around 5%. further, the separation process which applies blower as separation mean has been further analysed using eulerian model and dense discrete phase model (ddpm) in ansys fluent, for a purpose to understand the behaviour of jatropha fruits' particles under air flow during the separation process. the simulation revealed that some vortices have existed at converging portion or slope end of the designed separator duct due to instantaneous changes of air velocity and pressure. the formation of vortices could change the flowing direction of particles and lengthen the residence time of the particles in the duct. the phenomena were also found able to cause momentum loss of heavier kernel particles, achieving reduction of kernel loss during the separation process. the simulation results have provided a basis to understand the dynamics of multiphase flow. further, the numerical model makes the study possible to provide a better insight for making a decision along with future developed scaling factor for machine scaled up activity.

hydraulics	ski jump is one of the most effective structures in energy dissipation over spillways. spillways have long been of practical importance to safety of dams. the major criteria in hydraulic design are based on the analytical and empirical methods. in the current study, in order to increase chute spillway efficiency, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm known as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (nsga-ii) has been utilized to design the optimal triangular bucket angle and chute width. in design method, two separate objective functions have been used. in the first objective function, equations of dynamic pressure of the bucket, the jet length after bucket, and the scour depth have been used. the second objective function is related to construction volume of chute spillway. for calibrating the first objective function, characteristics of karoon iii dam have been used as a case study. the difference between design parameters of karoon iii spillway and those from nsga-ii algorithm method is less than 12 percent. according to the results, if the jet length is considered as the most impressive parameter in the first objective function, design of the spillway becomes frugal.

computer-aided_design	the authors of this study explored (a) body-to-pattern measurement and shape relationships in trouser patterns drafted by two methods; (b) the consistency of these body-to-pattern relationships between methods and between differently shaped bodies within methods; (c) the patternmaking procedures that cause these outcomes; and (d) how these findings impact garment fit, particularly for mass customization. body-to-pattern measurement and shape relationships were inconsistent between and within methods, making them unsuitable for use in computer-aided custom patternmaking. most strikingly, pattern crotch shapes were similar within each method, despite the fact that form crotch shapes were different. patternmaking procedures causing these inconsistencies include (a) use of proportion of noncorresponding body measurements; (b) use of standard, rather than body, measurements; (c) variations in ease as proportions or standard amounts; (d) trueing, blending, and connecting steps; (e) variation between methods of measurements used, in use of proportions or standard measurements, and in steps; and (h) disregard of body shape.
immunology	mycobacterium tuberculosis produces dideoxymy-cobactin- 838 (ddm-838), a lipopeptide that potently activates t cells upon binding to the mhc-like antigen-presenting molecule cd1a. m. tuberculosis produces ddm-838 in only trace amounts and a previous solid-phase synthesis provided sub-milligram quantities. we describe a high-yielding solution-phase synthesis of ddm-838 that features a mitsunobu substitution that avoids yield-limiting epimerization at lysine during esterification, and amidation conditions that prevent double-bond isomerization of the z-c20:1 acyl chain, and provides material with equivalent antigenicity to natural ddm-838. isomers of ddm-838 that varied in stereochemistry at the central lysine and the c20:1 acyl chain were compared for their ability to be recognised by cd1a-restricted t cell receptors (tcrs). these tcrs, derived from unrelated human donors, exhibited a similar spectrum of reactivity towards the panel of ddm-838 isomers, highlighting the exquisite sensitivity of lipopeptide-reactive t cells for the natural ddm stereochemistry.
human_metabolism	quercetin, a polyphenol with potential health effects, is absorbed by humans and measurement in plasma can be used as a biomarker for intake. however, the chemical nature of the quercetin in blood is still not known, although one possibility is that glucosides are found in an unchanged form from the original food. we propose that the existence of quercetin glucosides in plasma is unlikely, since the metabolic beta -glucosidase capacity of the small intestine and of the liver is too great for quercetin glucosides to escape deglycosylation. we critically examine the limited number of studies which purport to detect quercetin glycosides in blood and the current evidence for the absorption of these compounds from the gastrointestinal tract. we emphasise the need for comprehensive identification of circulating compounds, since polyphenol glucuronides, the expected metabolites in plasma, have almost identical chromatographic properties to the glucosides at acid ph. studies on the nature of quercetin metabolites in plasma are urgently needed so that the proposed biological activities of quercetin can be re-assessed and that a suitable biomarker of exposure can be established.
human_metabolism	the present work describes the electrochemical reduction of the azo dye sudan iii in methanol/0.01 mol l(-1) bu4nbf4 at applied potential of -1.2v, which promotes 98% discoloration of the commercial sample. the reduction products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, after optimized conditions for 20 aromatic amines with carcinogenic potentiality. the harmful compounds such as: aniline, benzidine, o-toluidine, 2,6-dimethylaniline, 4,4'-oxydianiline, 4,4'-metileno-bis-2-methylaniline and 4-aminobiphenyl are formed after azo bond cleavage. the electrochemical reduction is compared with chemical reduction by using sodium thiosulfate. our findings illustrates that commercial sudan iii under reductive condition can forms a number of products, which some are known active genotoxins. the technique could be used to mimic important redox reactions in human metabolism or environment, highlighting the possible formation of by-products more toxic than the original dyes.
fluid_mechanics	seawater viscosity is influenced by temperature as well as through excretion of exopolymers by some plankton. we examined the role of viscosity on the movement patterns and sensory abilities of the dinoflagellate heterocapsa triquetra, manipulating the viscosity of seawater to simulate a 10 +/- 1.5 degrees c temperature change. in a second treatment, we seeded the water with microbeads to examine swimming behaviours in the presence of a mechanical stimulus. increased viscosity reduced distances between conspecifics 4.7-fold and increased distances between protists and microbeads by 3.4-fold. increased viscosity also affected other aspects of motility, with an overall reduction in swimming speed of 2.0-and 7.0-fold for treatments with and without mechanical stimuli. higher viscosities were associated with upward vertical migration, in both the presence and absence of microbeads. cells were highly sensitive to disturbances to the velocity field, by as little as 1.5%, and different approach distances of h. triquetra to conspecifics over mechanical stimuli suggest sensory capacity to distinguish types of particles. mediation of motility and migratory behaviours through viscosity implies ramifications for the distribution of protists and their encounters with resources, predators and conspecifics triggered by events such as temperature changes and phytoplankton bloom events.
machine_design	the thermal analysis of high speed machine is necessary made to check of serviceability. the temperatures of electric machine individual parts influence other aspects of electric machine design. this paper deals with modeling of thermal phenomena of high seed asynchronous machine. the main requirement for this model is easy integration into electromagnetic model. the computational fluid dynamics (cfd) analysis can be used to determine some boundary condition of thermal model that are n't commonly known for high speed machine.
human_metabolism	scope: flavanol-rich foods are known to exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. the biological effects depend on bioavailability of flavanols which may be influenced by food matrix and dose ingested. we compared the bioavailability and dose-response of epicatechin from whole apple and an epicatechin-rich extract, and the effects on plasma and urinary nitric oxide (no) metabolites. methods and results: in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, subjects consumed drinks containing 70 and 140 mg epicatechin from an apple extract and an apple puree containing 70 mg epicatechin. blood and urine samples were collected for 24 h post ingestion. maximum plasma concentration, auc((0-24 h)), absorption and urinary excretion were all significantly higher after ingestion of both epicatechin drinks compared with apple puree (p < 0.05). time to maximum plasma concentration was significantly later for the puree compared with the drinks (p2-fold higher after ingestion of the 140 mg epicatechin drink compared to the 70 mg epicatechin drink (p < 0.05). excretion of no metabolites was higher for all test products compared with placebo, which was significant for the high dose drink (p = 0.016). conclusions: oral bioavailability of apple epicatechin increases at higher doses, is reduced by whole apple matrix and has the potential to increase no bioavailability.
fluid_mechanics	three basic diffusion properties of argon - shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity - were studied in the neighborhood of the critical point using molecular dynamics (md) and the lennard-jones potential energy function. md simulations were performed along the 1.0p(c), and 1.2p(c) isobars. green-kubo relations and a lennard-jones pair potential were used. four different sets of lennard-jones parameters were used. a comparison of computed shear viscosity and thermal conductivity values with data available from the national institute of standards and technology (nist) displayed a good agreement. results for bulk viscosity indicated that values of this property cannot be neglected in this thermodynamic region, a result that violates the traditional and much-assumed stokes hypothesis in classical fluid mechanics. furthermore, it was shown that in the neighborhood of the critical region the bulk viscosity can have larger values than the shear viscosity.

molecular_biology	advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) has long been a diagnosis with few treatment options and poor outcomes. however, recent discoveries about the molecular biology of nsclc are changing the way it is treated. driver mutations that cause uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation have been discovered in some types of nsclc. this has led to the discovery of therapies that can target a specific driver mutation in advanced nsclc and halt cancer progression. this article reviews standard treatment of nsclc and explores the targetable mutations of nsclc, available targeted treatments, treatment obstacles, and the future of targeted therapy in nsclc.
molecular_biology	background-circulating levels of chemerin are significantly higher in hypertensive patients and positively correlate with blood pressure. chemerin activates chemokine-like receptor 1 (cmklr1 or chemr23) and is proposed to activate the ""orphan"" g protein-coupled receptor 1 (gpr1), which has been linked with hypertension. our aim was to localize chemerin. cmklr1, and gpr1 in the human vasculature and determine whether 1 or both of these receptors mediate vasoconstriction. methods and results-using immunohistochemistry and molecular biology in conduit arteries and veins and resistance vessels, we localized chemerin to endothelium, smooth muscle, and adventitia and found that cmklr1 and gpr1 were widely expressed in smooth muscle. c9 (chemerin149-157) contracted human saphenous vein (pd(2)=7.30 +/- 0.31) and resistance arteries (pd(2)=7.05 +/- 0.54) and increased blood pressure in rats by 9.1 +/- 1.0 mm hg at 200 nmol. crucially, these in vitro and in vivo vascular actions were blocked by ccx832, which we confirmed to be highly selective for cmklr1 over gpr1. c9 inhibited camp accumulation in human aortic smooth muscle cells and preconstricted rat aorta, consistent with the observed vasoconstrictor action. downstream signaling was explored further and, compared to chemerin. c9 showed a bias factor=approximate to 5000 for the gi protein pathway, suggesting that cmklr1 exhibits biased agonism. conclusions-our data suggest that chemerin acts at cmklr1, but not gpr1, to increase blood pressure. chemerin has an established detrimental role in metabolic syndrome, and these direct vascular actions may contribute to hypertension, an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. this study provides proof of principle for the therapeutic potential of selective cmklr1 antagonists.
immunology	in this study, we attempted to explore the effect and possible mechanism of andrographolide on ova-induced asthma. ova challenge induced significant airway inflammatory cell recruitment and lung histological alterations, which were ameliorated by andrographolide. the protein levels of cytokines in bron-choalveolar fluid (balf) and serum were reduced by andrographolide administration as well as the mrna levels in lung tissue. mechanically, andrographolide markedly hampered the activation of nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b) and nlrp3 inflammasome both in vivo and vitro thus decreased levels of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. finally, we confirmed that ros scavenging was responsible for andrographolide 's inactivation of nf-kappa b and nlrp3 inflammasome signaling. our study here revealed the effect and possible mechanism of andrographolide on asthma, which may represent a new therapeutic approach for treating this disease.
computer-aided_design	background:horizontal advancement genioplasty can be extremely rewarding for microgenia. however, it is challenging for even very experienced surgeon to determine the three-dimensional position of the distant bone fragment during the operation. this study aimed to apply and evaluate computer-aided design (cad) and computer-aided manufacturing techniques for horizontal advancement genioplasty to improve surgical accuracy.methods:seven patients with microgenia were prospectively enrolled in the study. preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (ct), photographs, and lateral cephalograms were performed. computer-aided design was done based on preoperative ct data, and then surgical templates (cutting guide templates and fixation templates) were designed accordingly to guide horizontal advancement genioplasty. all surgeries were performed by junior surgeons. the accuracy of the authors' method was evaluated by the relative error (the mean value of discrepancy between postoperative ct and preoperative design at 6 points selected randomly/preoperative design movement x 100%), pg position error (postoperative pg advancement - preoperative cad pg advancement)/preoperative cad pg advancement x 100%), and me position error (postoperative me downward movement - preoperative cad me downward movement)/preoperative cad me downward movement x 100%). they are all calculated by geomagic automatically.results:all 7 patients were satisfied with their aesthetic outcomes. the average absolute relative error is 1.8%. the average absolute pg position error is 1.9% and the average absolute me position error value is 1.3%.conclusions:the authors' study showed that applying computer-assisted techniques for horizontal advancement genioplasty provided accurate surgical result. with this technique, best result for horizontal advancement genioplasty could be achieved by even inexperienced surgeons.
machine_design	the static and dynamic characteristics of the edm machine as the main machining unit directly influence the machining accuracy and stability. for a particular type of the edm machine, the three-dimensional model was built with solidworks and the finite element method was employed with the ansys workbench to analyze the static and dynamic characteristics of the machine. the results show that the stiffness of the ram and vertical guide (z-axis) in the y and z directions is the weak side of the machine. the analytical method is proved to be effective for the optimization of the machine design.
northern_blotting	some of the main concerns with in vivo application of naked small interfering rna are rapid degradation and urinary excretion resulting in a short plasma half-life. in this study we investigated how conjugation of polyethylene glycol ( peg) with variable chain length affects sirna pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. the peg chains were conjugated to chemically stabilized sirna at the 5 ' terminal end of the passenger strand using click chemistry. the sirna conjugate remained functionally active and showed significantly prolonged circulation in the blood stream after intravenous injection. sirna conjugated with 20kda peg (peg20k-sirna) was most persistent, approximately 50% peg20k-sirna remained ih post-injection, while the uncoupled sirna was rapidly removed >90% at 15min. in vivo fluorescent imaging of the living animal showed increased concentration of sirna in peripheral tissue and delayed urine excretion when coupled to peg 20k. biodistribution studies by northern blotting revealed equal distribution of conjugated sirna in liver, kidney, spleen and lung without significant degradation 24 h post-injection. our study demonstrates that peg conjugated sirna can be applied as a delivery system to improve sirna bioavailability in vivo and may potentially increase the efficiency of sirna in therapeutic applications.
human_metabolism	sixteen novel derivatives of 1,1,1-tris (salicylaldiminomethyl)ethane have been synthesized for the purpose of encapsulating tc-99m(iv) ions and generating new tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals. two methods for the preparation of the tc-99g(iv) analog complexes are presented; one utilizes sncl2 reduction on (tco4-)-tc-99g and the other a direct substitution route starting with [(tccl6)-tc-99g](2-). free ligands (h(3)l) are characterized by melting points, h-1 nmr, c-13 nmr, mass spectroscopy, tlc, and/or elemental analyses. [(99g)tcl](+) complexes are characterized by fab-ms, uv-vis, ir and/or cv. an x-ray structural analysis was performed on a crystal of [m(6,6'-[[2-[[((4-methoxy-2-hydroxyphenyl)methylene)-amino]methyl]-2-methyl-1,3-propanediyl]bis(nitrilomethylidyne)]-bis-3-methoxyphenol)] tetraphenylborate, where m represents a 1/3 isomorphous mixture of tc-99g/sn as determined by sem. the metal coordination site is 6-coordinate, composed of n3o3 donor atoms, and intermediate between octahedral and trigonal prismatic geometry. the [(99m)tcl](+) complexes were prepared in a stannous environment; equivalence of the tc-99m and tc-99g complexes is demonstrated by hplc techniques. the [snl](+) complex was prepared for comparison purposes. an unusual ligand oxidation occurs for one series of ligands in which in situ amine -->imine conversion is observed during the complexation reaction in reducing media. guinea pig, rat, dog, and human metabolism studies are reported for selected [(99m)tcl](+) complexes, the myocardial uptake of which approaches 2% of the injected dose.
molecular_biology	thermal tetrachloroethene (pce) remediation by steam injection in a sandy aquifer led to the release of dissolved organic carbon (doc) from aquifer sediments resulting in more reduced redox conditions, accelerated pce biodegradation, and changes in microbial populations. these changes were documented by comparing data collected prior to the remediation event and eight years later. based on the premise that dual c-cl isotope slopes reflect ongoing degradation pathways, the slopes associated with pce and tce suggest the predominance of biotic reductive dechlorination near the source area. pce was the predominant chlorinated ethene near the source area prior to thermal treatment. after thermal treatment, cdce became predominant. the biotic contribution to these changes was supported by the presence of dehalococcoides sp. dna (dhc) and dhc targeted rrna close to the source area. in contrast, dual c-ci isotope analysis together with the almost absent vc c-13 depletion in comparison to cdce c-13 depletion suggested that cdce was subject to abiotic degradation due to the presence of pyrite, possible surface-bound iron (ii) or reduced iron sulphides in the downgradient part of the plume. this interpretation is supported by the relative lack of dhc in the downgradient part of the plume. the results of this study show that thermal remediation can enhance the biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes, and that this effect can be traced to the mobilisation of doc due to steam injection. this, in turn, results in more reduced redox conditions which favor active reductive dechlorination and/or may lead to a series of redox reactions which may consecutively trigger biotically induced abiotic degradation. finally, this study illustrates the valuable complementary application of compound-specific isotopic analysis combined with molecular biology tools to evaluate which biogeochemical processes are taking place in an aquifer contaminated with chlorinated ethenes.

fluid_mechanics	ventilation is the intentional air supply to a closed space from the outside, which is essential for the sake of a comfortable environment and the health of human beings. in recent, with the wide spread of renewable energy, much attention has been paid to the natural ventilation. the natural ventilator is classified into a fixed type, a venturi type and a wind turbine type. in this study, the ventilation rates of the fixed type ventilator were experimentally investigated by changing the wind velocity. additionally, the condition of a backflow was also examined. according to the experimental results, the ventilated air flow strongly depended on the outside wind velocity and also on the intake opening area. in the reverse flow test, it was confirmed that the reverse flow into the ventilator occurred if the wind velocity was under a certain threshold value. furthermore, the reverse flow phenomenon was more severe when an obstacle is located in the downstream of a ventilator.
molecular_biology	background: wound healing is often impaired in diabetic animals and humans. matrix metalloproteases act as proinflammatory agents in physiological wound healing pathways by stimulating cytokines including the interleukins, il6, il1a and il1b, and the tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor beta1. botanicals are traditionally used to assist healing of different types of wounds, because they produce fewer side effects. our specific aim here was to develop a plant-based recipe supporting effective wound healing in diabetic animals. methods: plant materials from adiantum capillus-veneris, commiphora molmol, aloe vera, and henna were collected for this study, and oven-dried at 60 degrees c. the dried leaves and resins were then crumbled into a powder and mixed in equal parts with vaseline as a preservative. this mixture was used as an ointment on wounds induced in 60 diabetic and non-diabetic rats that were divided into 6 subgroups receiving agent or control treatments. necrotic tissue surrounding the wound was periodically removed during wound healing. rna was extracted from the healing region of the wound at days 7, 14 and 21 for cdna synthesis to monitor changes in tgfb1, mmp3, mmp9, il6 and tnf alpha expression using real-time pcr. results: the expression of the mmp3, the tnf alpha, and the tgfb1 genes from wound tissue were significantly different (p0.05) of the mmp9 gene expression in diabetic and non-diabetic rats treated only with vaseline after 7, 14, and 21 days. but, the expression of the mmp9 gene decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in diabetic rats after 14 days in comparison to non-diabetic rats, when the herbal mixture was added to vaseline. conclusions: our study presents an herbal treatment that alters the gene expression signature at wounds induced in the rat model for type i diabetes in a manner consistent with accelerated healing, and demonstrates that this herbal treatment might be effective to treat wounds in diabetic patients.
immunology	background: although discovery research has identified the importance of dozens of pro-and anti-inflammatory immune mediators in the pathogenesis, maintenance, exacerbation and resolution of inflammatory diseases, most human cohort studies have incorporated few or no immunological intermediate phenotypes in their analyses. significant hindrances have been (1) the limited panel of biomarkers known to be readily detected in healthy human populations and (2) the stability, hence utility, of such biomarkers to repeated analysis. methods: the frequency and stability of 14 plasma biomarkers linked to in vivo immune regulation of allergic and autoimmune inflammatory disorders was determined in 140 healthy pediatric and adult participants. the impact of initial and multiple subsequent freeze/thaw cycles on pro-inflammatory (ccl2, cxcl10, il-18, tnf alpha, il-6), anti-inflammatory (il-10, stnf-rii, il-1ra), acute phase proteins (crp, ptx3) and other biomarkers (sst2, il-1racp) was subsequently quantified. results: multiple biomarkers capable of providing an innate immune signature of inflammation were readily detected directly ex vivo in healthy individuals. these biomarker levels were unaffected when comparing paired data sets from freshly obtained, never frozen plasma or serum and matched aliquots despite extensive freeze/thaw cycles. neither age nor sex affected stability. similarly, no quantitative differences were found following repetitive analysis of inflammatory biomarkers in culture samples obtained following in vitro stimulation with tlr and rlr ligands. conclusions: a broad panel of in vivo and ex vivo cytokine, chemokine and acute phase protein biomarkers that have been linked to human chronic inflammatory disorders are readily detected in vivo and remain stable for analysis despite multiple freeze thaw cycles. these data provide the foundation and confidence for large scale analyses of panels of inflammatory biomarkers to provide better understanding of immunological mechanisms underlying health versus disease.
manufacturing_engineering	structural systems are subject to uncertainties due to variability in many hard-to-control noise factors, which include external loads, material properties, and construction workmanship. traditional structural design methodologies, although clearly recognizing the presence of uncertainty, omit robustness against the effects of uncertainty in the design process. first, if the actual uncertainties in the design process are underestimated, the design may fail to satisfy safety requirements. second, to guarantee safety in the presence of high variability of the system response, the structural designer may be forced to choose an overly conservative, thus inefficient and costly design. when robustness against uncertainty is not treated as one of the design objectives, the trade-off between over-design for safety and under-design for cost-savings is exacerbated. this manuscript demonstrates that safe and cost-effective structural engineering designs maybe achieved by implementing robust design concepts originally developed in manufacturing engineering to consider robustness against uncertainty. this manuscript presents an optimization-based methodology for the application of robust design principles to structural design and demonstrates its application on an academic problem involving design of a reinforced-concrete frame.

materials_engineering	designing materials for targeted performance requirements as required in integrated computational materials engineering (icme) demands a combined strategy of bottom-up and top-down modeling and simulation which treats various levels of hierarchical material structure as a mathematical representation, with infusion of systems engineering and informatics to deal with differing model degrees of freedom and uncertainty. moreover, with time, the classical materials selection approach is becoming generalized to address concurrent design of microstructure or mesostructure to satisfy product-level performance requirements. computational materials science and multiscale mechanics models play key roles in evaluating performance metrics necessary to support materials design. the interplay of systems-based design of materials with multiscale modeling methodologies is at the core of materials design. in high performance alloys and composite materials, maximum performance is often achieved within a relatively narrow window of process path and resulting microstructures. much of the attention to icme in the materials community has focused on the role of generating and representing data, including methods for characterization and digital representation of microstructure, as well as databases and model integration. on the other hand, the computational mechanics of materials and multidisciplinary design optimization communities are grappling with many fundamental issues related to stochasticity of processes and uncertainty of data, models, and multiscale modeling chains in decision-based design. this paper explores computational and information aspects of design of materials with hierarchical microstructures and identifies key underdeveloped elements essential to supporting icme. one of the messages of this overview paper is that icme is not simply an assemblage of existing tools, for such tools do not have natural interfaces to material structure nor are they framed in a way that quantifies sources of uncertainty and manages uncertainty in representing physical phenomena to support decision-based design.

strength_of_materials	the concepts of size and scale are of fundamental importance in science, engineering and technology, and occupy a central place in human experience and thought. size and shape are crucial properties of physical and abstract objects, while scale and dimension are basic descriptive tools that we employ to compare them. understanding the dependence of physical phenomena on size and scale allows us to develop predictive tools that form the core of design and enable the creation of artefacts and technological systems. of particular interest to us are situations when the size dependence turns out to be complex, characterized by changes and transitions in behaviour between different scales, e.g. laboratory and full scale prototypes, nano-scale objects as opposed to macroscopic, etc. scaling transitions and size effects in the fracture and strength of materials and structures have particular significance in modern science and engineering. the boundaries of scale of the mechanical phenomena studied and devices exploited are expanding, on the one hand, towards global scale phenomena, and on the other towards the nanometre scale processes. these circumstances challenge the conventional wisdom acquired over many decades, according to which laboratory experiments performed at the engineering scale (sub-mm to a few meters) provide the source of material property data then used as input for modelling at the scale of the real object. when deviations from accepted scaling laws are found, new physical deformation mechanisms need to be proposed or identified, and new modelling approaches to be developed and validated. in this paper i review some examples of non-trivial size dependence, and address a fundamental question of the efficient description of size effects and scale transitions. the functional description of multi-scaling power law regimes is considered, and the functional form suitable for the task is identified. this form is then applied to a variety of experimental data manifesting size effects, including dual failure strength criteria (stress and toughness), fatigue crack growth thresholds (kitagawa-takahashi diagram) and applications in the context of fretting fatigue, paris fatigue crack growth law, hardness of coated systems, etc.
computer-aided_design	user interface (ui) design patterns for mobile applications provide a solution to design problems and can improve the usage experience for users. however, there is a lack of research categorizing the uses of design patterns according to users' hand dominance in a learning-based mobile ui. we classified the main design patterns for mobile applications and investigated their relationships with major learning tasks. students' use of different patterns was compared with respect to hand dominance. a questionnaire on 71 patterns was administered to 92 participants, and the number of patterns they used was analyzed. ui design patterns for mobile learning significantly differed between left- and right-hand-dominant participants. we also performed a cluster analysis to explore possible theme sets among participants with regard to hand dominance in learning. the results revealed three-cluster solutions for both the left- and right-hand-dominant groups. we profiled these solutions based on insights obtained from structured interviews. our findings provide evidence that pattern use differs between right- and left-hand-dominant users with regard to reading, information retrieval, and information-browsing tasks. these findings will facilitate further development of suitable uis for educational mobile applications.
internal_combustion_engine	in a torch ignition engine system, the combustion starts in a pre-combustion chamber, where the pressure increase pushes the combustion jet flames through calibrated nozzles to be precisely targeted into the main combustion chamber. this paper presents the layout of the prototype engine and the developed fuel injection system. it continues with a detailed description of the performance of the torch ignition engine running on a gasoline/ethanol blend for different mixture stratification levels as well as engine speeds and loads. also detailed analyses of specific fuel consumption, thermal and combustion efficiency, specific emissions of co2 and the main combustion parameters are carried out. a numerical model based on thermodynamic and kinetic analyses has been established in order to explore the performance limit of a stratified torch ignition engine. the paper concludes presenting the main numerical results obtained in this work, which show a significant increase in the torch ignition engine performance as compared with the commercial baseline engine.

human_metabolism	introduction: background to metabolomics metabolomics is the comprehensive study of the metabolome, the repertoire of biochemicals (or small molecules) present in cells, tissues, and body fluids. the study of metabolism at the global or ""-omics"" level is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to have a profound impact upon medical practice. at the center of metabolomics, is the concept that a person 's metabolic state provides a close representation of that individual 's overall health status. this metabolic state reflects what has been encoded by the genome, and modified by diet, environmental factors, and the gut microbiome. the metabolic profile provides a quantifiable readout of biochemical state from normal physiology to diverse pathophysiologies in a manner that is often not obvious from gene expression analyses. today, clinicians capture only a very small part of the information contained in the metabolome, as they routinely measure only a narrow set of blood chemistry analytes to assess health and disease states. examples include measuring glucose to monitor diabetes, measuring cholesterol and high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein ratio to assess cardiovascular health, bun and creatinine for renal disorders, and measuring a panel of metabolites to diagnose potential inborn errors of metabolism in neonates. objectives of white paper-expected treatment outcomes and metabolomics enabling tool for precision medicine we anticipate that the narrow range of chemical analyses in current use by the medical community today will be replaced in the future by analyses that reveal a far more comprehensive metabolic signature. this signature is expected to describe global biochemical aberrations that reflect patterns of variance in states of wellness, more accurately describe specific diseases and their progression, and greatly aid in differential diagnosis. such future metabolic signatures will: (1) provide predictive, prognostic, diagnostic, and surrogate markers of diverse disease states; (2) inform on underlying molecular mechanisms of diseases; (3) allow for sub-classification of diseases, and stratification of patients based on metabolic pathways impacted; (4) reveal biomarkers for drug response phenotypes, providing an effective means to predict variation in a subject 's response to treatment (pharmacometabolomics); (5) define a metabotype for each specific genotype, offering a functional read-out for genetic variants: (6) provide a means to monitor response and recurrence of diseases, such as cancers: (7) describe the molecular landscape in human performance applications and extreme environments. importantly, sophisticated metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools have recently been developed that make it possible to measure thousands of metabolites in blood, other body fluids, and tissues. such tools also enable more robust analysis of response to treatment. new insights have been gained about mechanisms of diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and a range of pathologies. a series of ground breaking studies supported by national institute of health (nih) through the pharmacometabolomics research network and its partnership with the pharmacogenomics research network illustrate how a patient 's metabotype at baseline, prior to treatment, during treatment, and post-treatment, can inform about treatment outcomes and variations in responsiveness to drugs (e.g., statins, antidepressants, antihypertensives and antiplatelet therapies). these studies along with several others also exemplify how metabolomics data can complement and inform genetic data in defining ethnic, sex, and gender basis for variation in responses to treatment, which illustrates how pharmacometabolomics and pharmacogenomics are complementary and powerful tools for precision medicine. conclusions: key scientific concepts and recommendations for precision medicine our metabolomics community believes that inclusion of metabolomics data in precision medicine initiatives is timely and will provide an extremely valuable layer of data that compliments and informs other data obtained by these important initiatives. our metabolomics society, through its ""precision medicine and pharmacometabolomics task group"", with input from our metabolomics community at large, has developed this white paper where we discuss the value and approaches for including metabolomics data in large precision medicine initiatives. this white paper offers recommendations for the selection of state of-the-art metabolomics platforms and approaches that offer the widest biochemical coverage, considers critical sample collection and preservation, as well as standardization of measurements, among other important topics. we anticipate that our metabolomics community will have representation in large precision medicine initiatives to provide input with regard to sample acquisition/preservation, selection of optimal omics technologies, and key issues regarding data collection, interpretation, and dissemination. we strongly recommend the collection and biobanking of samples for precisionmedicine initiatives that will take into consideration needs for large-scale metabolic phenotyping studies.
thermodynamics	water engages in two important types of interactions near biomolecules: it forms ordered cages around exposed hydrophobic regions, and it participates in hydrogen bonds with surface polar groups. both types of interaction are critical to biomolecular structure and function, but explicitly including an appropriate number of solvent molecules makes many applications computationally intractable. a number of implicit solvent models have been developed to address this problem, many of which treat these two solvation effects separately. here, we describe a new model to capture polar solvation effects, called sho (solvent hydrogen-bond occlusion); our model aims to directly evaluate the energetic penalty associated with displacing discrete first-shell water molecules near each solute polar group. we have incorporated sho into the rosetta energy function, and find that scoring protein structures with sho provides superior performance in loop modeling, virtual screening, and protein structure prediction benchmarks. these improvements stem from the fact that sho accurately identifies and penalizes polar groups that do not participate in hydrogen bonds, either with solvent or with other solute atoms (unsatisfied polar groups). we expect that in future, sho will enable higher-resolution predictions for a variety of molecular modeling applications.

polymerase_chain_reaction	whipple 's disease is a rare infectious disease that can be fatal if left untreated. the disease is caused by infection with tropheryma whipplei, a bacterium that may be more common than was initially assumed. most patients present with nonspecific symptoms, and as routine cultivation of the bacterium is not feasible, it is difficult to diagnose this infection. on the other hand, due to the generic symptoms, infection with this bacterium is actually quite often in the differential diagnosis. the gold standard for diagnosis used to be periodic acid-schiff (pas) staining of duodenal biopsy specimens, but pas staining has a poor specificity and sensitivity. the development of molecular techniques has resulted in more convenient methods for detecting t. whipplei infections, and this has greatly improved the diagnosis of this often missed infection. in addition, the molecular detection of t. whipplei has resulted in an increase in knowledge about its pathogenicity, and this review gives an overview of the new insights in epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of tropheryma whipplei infections.
fluid_mechanics	in fluid mechanics, a lot of authors have been executing their researches to obtain the analytical solutions of navierstokes equations, even for 3d case of compressible gas flow. but there is an essential deficiency of non-stationary solutions indeed. in our derivation, we explore the case of non-stationary helical flow of the navierstokes equations for incompressible fluids at any given initial conditions for velocity fields (it means an open choice for the space part of a solution). such a non-stationary helical flow is proved to be decreasing exponentially in regard to the time-parameter, the extent of time-dependent exponential component is given by the coefficient of kinematic viscosity, multiplied by the square of the coefficient of proportionality between the vorticity and velocity field.

human_metabolism	the contribution of gordonibacter to the different abilities, both qualitative and quantitative, of individuals to transform dietary ellagic acid into anti-inflammatory urolithins was investigated. a specific and suitable q-pcr system was developed for the detection and quantification of gordonibacter. ellagic acid metabolism in the gut and faecal microbiota of healthy individuals, who consumed walnuts (n = 20) or a pomegranate extract (n = 49), were studied. urolithin-a was positively correlated to gordonibacter in faeces, whereas excretion of isourolithin-a and/or urolithin-b was inversely correlated to both. the relationship between gordonibacter and urolithin-a found in vivo was also confirmed in vitro. this suggests that the beneficial effects attributed to the consumption of foods containing ellagic acid could be mediated by the individuals' gordonibacter levels. the development of prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotic aimed at increasing gordonibacter and related species could improve the individual 's ability to produce the anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and anticancer metabolite urolithin-a.

computer-aided_design	the design of electric machines is a hot topic in the syllabuses of several undergraduate and graduate courses. with the development of hybrid and electrical vehicles, this subject is gaining more popularity, especially in electrical engineering courses. this paper presents a computer-aided educational tool to guide engineering students in the design process of a switched reluctance machine. a step-by-step design procedure is detailed and a user guide interface programmed in the matlab (r) environment developed for this purpose is shown. this user guide interface has been proved a useful tool to help the students to validate the results obtained in their lecture assignments, while aiding to achieve a better understanding of the design process of electric machines. a validation of the educational tool is done by means of finite element method simulations.
thermodynamics	adsorption of methane on twelve microporous carbon adsorbents of different origin and structural and energy characteristics was studied at the pressures up to 20 mpa. specific capacities have been calculated for methane adsorption storage systems. the effectiveness of adsorption accumulation was analyzed in terms of structural and energy characteristics, packing density and thermodynamic parameters of methane adsorption. differential molar isosteric heats of adsorption and absolute efficiency of adsorption accumulation systems were evaluated. the effects of increased packing density and proper shape of adsorbent material on the adsorption accumulation efficiency were considered. it was shown that a selection of an adsorbent with the most optimal porous structure and density should be adjusted for thermodynamic parameters of accumulation system.
northern_blotting	gene expression is regulated at several levels in plants, and one of the most recently discovered regulatory layers involve short rnas. short rnas are produced through several pathways and target either mrnas or genomic dna. different classes of short rnas have slightly different sizes and detection of their accumulation is an important step in validating and studying non-coding short rnas. northern blotting is routinely used to detect short rnas because it gives information about both the amount and size of the analysed short rnas. choice of the right rna extraction protocol is crucial when short rnas are being studied, because several routinely used commercial rna extraction kits do not yield any short rnas. this chapter describes optimised rna extraction methods, which give good yields of short rnas, and separation, transfer and hybridisation protocols to study the accumulation of short rnas.
cell_biology	objective: the objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on the resorption activity of osteoclast cell cultures. design: raw 264.7 cells were cultured and seeded over plates that were pre-coated with a synthetic carbonate apatite, and marked with fluoresceinamine-labeled sodium chondroitin polysulfate. plates were randomly divided into 4 groups according to the treatment assigned to each one of them: no rankl (no rank-l addition and no ultrasound application), no lipus (addition of rank-l and no ultrasound application), lipus 10 (addition of rank-l and 10 min of ultrasound application per day), and lipus 20 (addition of rank-l and 20 min of ultrasound application per day). the ultrasound device produced 1.5 mhz pulses with a repetition rate of 1 khz and intensity of 30 mw/cm(2). the experiment extended for one week and afterwards, resorption activity was evaluated according to the fluorescence intensity analysis and pit resorption measurements (number of pits and mean area). results: our experiment consistently demonstrated that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound application enhanced osteoclasts resorptive activity. in addition, it was demonstrated that when daily ultrasound application lasted longer (20 min) the resorption was the highest. results obtained from both evaluation methods were reasonably coherent. conclusions: low-intensity pulsed ultrasound increases osteoclast resorptive activity in the absence of osteoblasts. this effect seems to be influenced by ultrasound treatment time. future research might be directed to investigate osteoclast response to different ultrasound application protocols (frequencies and intensities) and potential cellular mechanisms.

polymerase_chain_reaction	long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have emerged recently as important factors in regulating fundamental biological processes. alterations in the expression and function of lncrnas have been observed to promote tumor formation, progression and metastasis. although downregulation of the expression levels of let lncrna in several tumors has been reported, its role in gastric cancer remains unknown. the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and function of let in gastric cancer development. the expression levels of let in 37 pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr). in addition, let expression in gastric cancer cell lines was analyzed by rt-qpcr assay analysis. furthermore, the impact of let on cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were detected using the cell counting kit-8, wound scratch and elisa assays, respectively. the results demonstrated that the expression level of let was downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines (sgc-7901 and mgc-803) compared with normal tissues and a normal human gastric epithelial cell line (ges-1). restoration of let expression using a synthesized recombinant overexpression vector transfected into sgc-7901 and mgc-803 cells, significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. the present study is the first to demonstrate that let may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. the results indicate that let may be a promising biomarker and/or a therapeutic target for gastric cancer.
northern_blotting	conditionally transformed human myocardial cell lines would be a valuable resource for studying human cardiac cell biology. we generated clonal human fetal cardiocyte cell lines by transfection of fetal ventricular cardiac cell clones with a plasmid containing a replication-defective mutant of the temperature-sensitive sv40 strain tsa58. multiple resulting cell lines showed similar features, namely: (1) t antigen (tag) expression at both permissive (34 degrees c) and restrictive (40.5 degrees c) temperatures; (2) extended growth capacity in comparison with parental wild type, when grown at the permissive temperature; (3) both temperature-dependent and serum-responsive growth, and; (4) an incompletely differentiated fetal phenotype which was similar at both permissive and restrictive temperatures and in the presence and absence of serum. the transformed myocyte phenotype was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry, western and northern blotting, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). cell lines expressed skeletal alpha-actin, atrial natriuretic peptide (anp), and keratins, but no sarcomeric myosin heavy chain or desmin. immunoreactive sarcomeric actin was expressed predominantly as a truncated protein of approximately 38 kd. the phenotype of the transformed cells differs from that of the wild-type parental cells as well as from those reported by others who have used tag to immortalize rodent or human ventricular myocytes. our cell lines should provide a useful tool for study of the molecular mechanisms regulating growth and differentiation in human cardiac muscle cells.
immunology	background studies of children with food allergy typically only include the mother and have not investigated the relationship between the amount of allergen needed to elicit a clinical reaction (threshold) and health-related quality of life (hrql). our aims were (i) to compare self-reported and parent-reported hrql in different age groups, (ii) to evaluate the impact of severity of allergic reaction and threshold on hrql, and (iii) to investigate factors associated with patient-reported and parent-reported hrql. methods age-appropriate food allergy quality of life questionnaires (faqlq) were completed by 73 children, 49 adolescents and 29 adults with peanut, hazelnut or egg allergy. parents (197 mothers, 120 fathers) assessed their child 's hrql using the faqlq-parent form. clinical data and threshold values were obtained from a hospital database. significant factors for hrql were investigated using univariate and multivariate regression. results female patients reported greater impact of food allergy on hrql than males did. egg and hazelnut thresholds did not affect hrql, but lower peanut threshold was associated with worse hrql. both parents scored their child 's hrql better than the child 's own assessment, but whereas mother-reported hrql was significantly affected by limitations in the child 's social life, father-reported hrql was affected by limitations in the family 's social life. severity of allergic reaction did not contribute significantly to hrql. conclusion the risk of accidental allergen ingestion and limitations in social life are associated with worse hrql. fathers provide a unique perspective and should have a greater opportunity to contribute to food allergy research.
southern_blotting	tristetraprolin (ttp) is a ccch tandem zinc finger protein that can bind to and destabilize certain mrnas containing au-rich element (are) binding sites. in this study, a novel porcine cdna has been isolated by expressed sequence tag assembly and subsequently confirmed by rt-pcr analysis, and designated porcine ttp (pottp). the open reading frame of the pottp cdna is 981 bp, encoding 326 amino acids. the pottp gene is approximately 2.5 kb in size and contains a single intron. southern blotting analysis demonstrated that it is a single copy gene. real-time quantitative pcr analysis revealed that the pottp gene is constitutively expressed in all detected tissues, and with the highest mrna level in lymphoid tissues spleen and thymus. recombinant his6-tagged pottp protein and its two zinc finger mutants (c146g and h127i) were efficiently expressed and purified from escherichia coli bl21 (de3), respectively. in vitro, rna-electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed a direct interaction between pottp protein and porcine tnf-alpha (potnf-alpha) mrna are probe; this interaction was eliminated when using either two zinc finger mutants of pottp. consistently, mutations within the are region prevented the binding interaction between recombinant pottp protein and potnf-alpha mrna are probe. these results indicate that pottp is an are-binding protein that might regulate the turnover of certain mrnas in vivo.

thermodynamics	graphite nanoparticles originated from high purity graphite crucible were used for deoxidization and purification of li2bef4 molten salt containing a bit of (nh4)(2)bef4 under high temperature vacuum condition. and the mechanism of deoxidization and purification via graphite nanoparticles was put forward based on analysis of sample characterization and chemical reaction gibbs free energy calculation. the morphology, particle size, chemical composition and crystal structure of graphite nanoparticles in li2bef4 molten salt were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (hrtem, saed and eds). phase analysis, total oxygen content, full elemental and anion concentration for as prepared li2bef4 products were studied by x-ray diffraction (xrd), leco nitrogen-oxygen analyzer, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (icp-oes) and ion chromatography (ic), respectively. the results of sample characterization showed that graphite nanoparticles in li2bef4 molten salt were the poly-crystal round sheet shape with an average diameter of <100 nm. the concentration of total oxygen, sulfur and nickel in as-prepared li2bef4 molten salt after treatment were 548 ppm, <0.6 ppm and <0.4 ppm, respectively. experiment and calculation all showed that so42- and no3- could react with carbon at 700 degrees c. and vacuum degassing play an excellent role in deoxidization and purification for li2bef4 molten salt via graphite nanoparticles.

hydraulics	we extend a recently proposed 2d depth-integrated finite volume solver for the nonlinear shallow water equations with non-hydrostatic pressure distribution. the proposed model is aimed at simulating both nonlinear and dispersive shallow water processes. we split the total pressure into its hydrostatic and dynamic components and solve a hydrostatic problem and a non-hydrostatic problem sequentially, in the framework of a fractional time step procedure. the dispersive properties are achieved by incorporating the non-hydrostatic pressure component in the governing equations. the governing equations are the depth-integrated continuity equation and the depth-integrated momentum equations along the x, y and z directions. unlike the previous non-hydrostatic shallow water solver, in the z momentum equation, we retain both the vertical local and convective acceleration terms. in the former solver, we keep only the local vertical acceleration term. in this paper, we investigate the effects of these convective terms and the possible improvements of the computed solution when these terms are not neglected in the governing equations, especially in strongly nonlinear processes. the presence of the convective terms in the vertical momentum equation leads to a numerical solution procedure, which is quite different from the one of the previous solver, in both the hydrostatic and dynamic steps. we discretize the spatial domain using unstructured triangular meshes satisfying the generalized delaunay property. the numerical solver is shock capturing and easily addresses wetting/drying problems, without any additional equation to solve at wet/dry interfaces. we present several numerical applications for challenging flooding processes encountered in practical aspects over irregular topography, including a new set of experiments carried out at the hydraulics laboratory of the university of palermo.

machine_design	a 6/8 flux-switching machine with large air-gap and toroidal winding design is presented. the fractional-slot winding of c-core flux-switching machine is wound around the stator yoke instead of the stator pole in this machine design. on the basis of the c-core flux-switching machine several modifications of the stator core shape and of pm arrangement are evaluated by means of 2d finite element analysis. a significant enhancement of the torque capability of the toroidal winding design can be achieved by some minor changes of the stator core shape. additionally, the application of halbach shaped magnets leads to even more torque and a reduction of the leakage flux at the stator outer diameter.

human_metabolism	investigations utilizing recombinant human xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes as well as human hepatocytes have revealed a number of interactions not only between different environmental chemicals (ecs) but also between ecs and endogenous metabolites. organophosphorus insecticides (ops) are potent inhibitors of the human metabolism of carbaryl, carbofuran, deet and fipronil, as well as the jet fuel components, nonane and naphthalene. ops are potent irreversible inhibitors of testosterone metabolism by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 and of estradiol metabolism by cyp3a4 and cyp1a2. all of these cyp inhibitions are believed to be due to the release of reactive sulfur during cyp-catalyzed oxidative desulfuration. it has also been shown that the esterase(s) responsible for the initial step in permethrin metabolism in human liver is inhibited by both chlorpyrifos oxon and carbaryl. a number of pesticides, including chlorpyrifos, fipronil and permethrin, and the repellent, deet, have been shown to be inducers of cyp isoforms in human hepatocytes, with fipronil being the most potent. several agrochemicals, including fipronil and the pyrethroids, permethrin and deltamethrin, show toxicity toward human hepatocytes with fipronil being the most potent in this regard. endosulfan-alpha, which has shown promise as a model substrate for phenotyping cyp3a4 and cyp2b6 in human liver microsomes, is also an inducer of cyp2b6, acting through the pxr receptor.

polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: the properties of self-renewal and division in spermatogonial stem cells (sscs) support spermatogenesis. there is a number of reported methods for in vitro ssc culture systems. the development of a culture system that effectively supports isolation and self-renewal of germline stem cells (gscs) is of tremendous benefit for clinical trials, experimental research, and as potential treatment for male infertility. the current study aims to consider the cultivation and behavior of gscs in a non-adherent culture system. materials and methods: in this experimental study, we cultured testicular cells from neonatal mice in agarose coated plates in the presence of dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium (dmem) medium (ctrl group), 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs)+dmem (10% group), and growth factor (g group) that contained 2% fbs, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf), epidermal growth factor (egf), and fibroblast growth factor (fgf). mouse spermatogonial stem-like colonies were isolated approximately 3 weeks after digestion of the testis tissue. after passages 2-3, the identity of the mouse spermatogonial stem-like cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and flow cytometry against the germ cell markers alpha 6, beta 1, c-kit, thy-1, c-ret, plzf, and oct4. the statistical significance between mean values in different groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance (anova). results: we observed spermatogonial stem-like colonies in the g and 10% groups, but not the ctrl group. immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and rt-pcr confirmed expressions of germ cell markers in these cells. in the spermatogonial stem-like cells, we observed a significant expression (p<0.05) of germ cell markers in the g and 10% groups versus the testis cells (t). their proliferative and apoptotic activities were examined by ki67 and pi/annexin v-fitc. alkaline phosphatase assay showed that mouse spermatogonial stem-like colonies were partially positive. conclusion: a non-adherent culture system could provide a favorable method for in vitro short-term culture of spermatogonial stem-like cell colonies.
northern_blotting	colorectal carcinoma (crc) is a malignant solid tumor arising from the large intestine and is associated with an increasing incidence and poor prognosis. further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying crc may contribute to the development of novel effective therapeutic strategies. micrornas (mirs), including mir-155, have been reported to be associated with the etiology and biology of crc; however, the molecular mechanisms by which mir-155 affect crc remain to be fully elucidated. the present study used a multidisciplinary approach, involving reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, northern blotting, mtt assay, cell cycle progression analysis, immunoblotting, and animal experiments, to determine the possible targets of mir-155 in crc cells. mir-155 was found to be overexpressed in crc tissue samples, compared with paired normal colon tissue samples. in addition, the inhibition of mir-155 induced a deceleration in crc cell proliferation and inactivation of the wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. mir-155 suppression also reduced the growth of crc xenografts in an animal model. hmg-box transcription factor 1 (hbp1) was identified as a novel target of mir-155, which mediated its effect on crc via the wnt/-catenin pathway. furthermore, patients with crc exhibiting higher serum levels of mir-155 exhibited reduced survival rates. in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that mir-155 may contribute to the progression and growth of crc by enhancing the wnt/-catenin pathway in an hbp1-associated mechanism. therefore, mir-155 may be considered a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of crc.
human_metabolism	background. the question whether even-chain fatty acids can be converted into glucose has a long-standing tradition in biochemistry. since the glyoxylate shunt is absent from mammals, the question has been considered to be solved. it is of particular relevance for understanding the metabolic state of natives of the arctic regions due to the very high fat content of their traditional diet only containing negligible amounts of carbohydrates. methods & results. using an in silico approach, we discovered several hitherto unknown routes in human metabolism that allow the conversion of even-chain fatty acids into carbohydrates in humans. these pathways proceed via ketogenesis over the intermediate of acetone and produce the gluconeogenic precursor pyruvate. while these pathways can make a contribution to glucose production during times of limited carbohydrate supply, we found that their capacity might be limited due to a high demand in reducing equivalents in acetone degradation. considering the traditional diet of natives of the arctic regions, the detected pathways are not only important in order to improve carbohydrate supply, but moreover reduce the amount of protein that needs to be used for gluconeogenesis. conclusion. in summary, our study sheds new light on our understanding of the metabolic state of natives from the arctic regions on their traditional diet. moreover, they provide an avenue for new analyses that can reveal how humans have adapted metabolically to a practically carbohydrate-free diet.
hydraulics	for more than 20 years, hydrogeomorphological mapping in france has been considered as an efficient method of flood mapping that contributes to sustainable land development by taking into account occurrences of extreme events. the european floods directive (2007/60/ce) requires the production of maps showing water depths during extreme flood events. this article provides an overview of the numerical floodplain models (nfm) methodology, which uses hydrogeomorphological observations and lidar dem data to produce water depth mapping. this article focuses on the nfm realised for the meurthe river, close to the city of nancy, france. the nfm methodology initially charts the floodplain from hydrogeomorphological mapping, then uses simple hydraulics for validation, and finally produces water depth maps with gis processing. the resulting nfm shows good agreement with the historic 1947 flood. this methodology is a simple and complementary solution to hydraulics modelling. it provides a better way to communicate information on the extent extreme floods and shows the importance of hydrogeomorphology in flood hazard study and management.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: many micrornas (mirnas) have recently been shown to demonstrate critical roles in differentiation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs). methods and results: in this study, a certain amount of mirna expression in vsmcs was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and it was found that microrna-30e (mir-30e) was expressed more strongly than other common vascular well-expressed mirnas in vitro. subsequently, both a gain and loss of function study was performed in vitro and in vivo. it was found that mir-30e in vsmcs was strongly downregulated concomitantly with stimulation, and mir-30e inhibited vsmcs proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo. furthermore, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2i (ube2i) was identified as the target gene of endogenous mir-30e by luciferase reporter assay, and it was confirmed that overexpression of mir-30e significantly reduced ube2i and inhibited the phenotypic switch of vsmcs. knockdown of ube2i had an influence over the proliferation and migration of cultured vsmcs, as same as the mir-30e mimic did. overexpression of mir-30e induced the apoptosis of vsmcs and deregulated the protein expression of ikba, which is crucial for the nf.b signal pathway. conclusions: the results of this study indicated that mir-30e in vsmcs exerted an anti-atherosclerosis effect via inhibiting proliferation and migration, and promoting apoptosis of vsmcs. more specifically, it was demonstrated that mir-30e exhibited these effects on vsmcs partially through targeting ube2i and downregulating the i kappa ba/nf kappa b signaling pathway.
molecular_biology	aims in cystic and solid pancreatic lesions, kras mutational status refines the diagnosis of uncertain endoscopic ultrasound (eus) aspirates. this test should have a fast turnaround time and ideally be performed at the centre where the patient is diagnosed. the idylla kras mutation test enables standardisation even in units without molecular expertise. methods the idylla test was designed for use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) sections. however, we directly pipetted 3 mu l (corresponding to 1/10th of a dna preparation from the aspirate sample) in the cartridge, which was automatically run as if an ffpe sample had been inserted. the performance was compared with sanger sequencing, allele specific locked nucleic acid pcr (aslnaqpcr), and 454 next generation sequencing (454-ngs) in light of clinicopathological end points. results idylla yielded valid results in 49/52 (94.2%) cases, in 2h. a total of 18/49 cases showed mutation either in kras exon 2 (14/18) or in exon 3 (4/18). idylla kras test had 100% specificity and a sensitivity (55.1%) higher than sanger sequencing (41.3%) and identical to aslnaqpcr (55.1%). when the low-abundant mutant allele (<5%) cases were excluded from the analysis, the idylla kras mutation test clinical sensitivity increased to 61.9% approaching that of 454-ngs (66.6%). conclusions this is the first study that applied the novel idylla kras test to the clinical setting of pancreatic cancer. in particular, this system can be easily implemented in the routine assessment of pancreatic eus-fine-needle aspiration-derived dna samples to quickly provide information on kras mutational status to supplement cytological evaluation.
enzymology	objective recent studies suggest that the e-selectin ligands expressed on human leukocytes may differ from those in other species, particularly mice. to elaborate on this, we evaluated the impact of glycosphingolipids expressed on human myeloid cells in regulating e-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. approach and results a series of modified human cell lines and primary neutrophils were created by targeting udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase using either lentivirus-delivered shrna or crispr-cas9-based genome editing. enzymology and mass spectrometry confirm that the modified cells had reduced or abolished glucosylceramide biosynthesis. glycomics profiling showed that udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase disruption also increased prevalence of bisecting n-glycans and reduced overall sialoglycan expression on leukocyte n- and o-glycans. microfluidics-based flow chamber studies demonstrated that both the udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase knockouts and knockdowns display approximate to 60% reduction in leukocyte rolling and firm adhesion on e-selectin bearing stimulated endothelial cells, without altering cell adhesion to p-selectin. consistent with the concept that the glycosphingolipids support slow rolling and the transition to firm arrest, inhibiting udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase activity resulted in frequent leukocyte detachment events, skipping motion, and reduced diapedesis across the endothelium. cells bearing truncated o- and n-glycans also sustained cell rolling on e-selectin, although their ability to be recruited from free fluid flow was diminished. conclusions glycosphingolipids likely contribute to human myeloid cell adhesion to e-selectin under fluid shear, particularly the transition of rolling cells to firm arrest.
hydraulics	in order to reduce the accumulation of hydrogen and thus to mitigate the risk of combustion, many countries have installed passive autocatalytic recombiners (pars) within light water reactor containments. the severe hydrogen combustion events of the recent fukushima daiichi accident are likely to incentivize an increased demand in upgrading nuclear power plants with pars. numerical simulation is an important tool for assessing par operation during a severe accident in terms of efficiency and proper installation. advanced numerical par models are required for the challenging boundary conditions during a severe accident, for example, low oxygen amount, high steam amount, and presence of carbon monoxide. the reko-direkt code has been developed in order to provide a par model capable of simulating complex par phenomena and at the same time being suitable for implementation in thermal-hydraulic codes. the development of reko-direkt was supported by small-scale experiments performed at forschungszentrum juelich in the reko facilities. these facilities allow the study of par-related single phenomena such as reaction kinetics under different conditions including variation of steam, oxygen, and carbon monoxide (reko-3) and the chimney effect (reko-4). recently, the code has been validated against full-scale experiments performed in the thermal-hydraulics, hydrogen, aerosols, iodine (thai) facility at eschborn, germany, in the framework of the organisation for economic co-operation and development/ nuclear energy agency thai project. by this, the code has proven its applicability for different par designs and for a broad range of boundary conditions (pressure of up to 3 bars, steam amount up to 60 vol %, low-oxygen conditions). reko-direkt has been successfully implemented in the commercial computational fluid dynamics code ansys-cfx as well as in the lp code cocosys [gesellschaft for anlag- und reaktorsicherheit (grs), germany].
computer-aided_design	while early and intermediate results of fontan palliation have greatly improved the survival and quality of life of patients with single ventricle physiology, late complications remain concerning, and leave room for further improvement. in addition to recent advances in surgical techniques and post-operative care, advances in medical imaging and related technologies can further improve pre-surgical planning and post-operative management of these complex patients. novel technologies including advanced mri, computer aided design, three-dimensional printing, virtual surgery and computational fluid dynamics may provide better patient-specific surgical plans, and continue to improve long-term outcomes.

hydraulics	monte carlo method can provide high fidelity neutronic analysis of different types of nuclear reactors, owing to its advantages of the flexible geometry modeling and the use of continuous-energy nuclear cross sections. it can also be coupled with thermal-hydraulics codes to consider feedbacks. due to the effect of thermal motion of target nucleus known as doppler effect, special treatments have to be used for cross sections at different temperature points. the traditional approach of pre-generated cross sections has difficulty of memory footprint when the number of temperature points is large. the target motion sampling (tms) method was proposed and developed in serpent code for temperature treatment based on the woodcock tracking. in this paper, the tms method was developed in rmc code based on the ray tracking. moreover, doppler-broadening rejection correction (dbrc) technique was also implemented in rmc to consider the effect of thermal motion on scattering kinematics. the pre-generated technique was proposed and applied to accelerate the calculation of tms method. the results show that tms method is equivalent to the exact cross-sections with dbrc, while tms in rmc has higher efficiency in the cases of pwr and htgr, no matter that the number of nuclides is small or large.

human_metabolism	the kinetic equivalency of propylene glycol monomethyl ether (pgme), derived from propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (pgmea), as well as the parent compound (pgme) following intravenous administration to fischer 344 rats was evaluated. in addition, in vitro hydrolysis rates of pgmea in blood and liver tissue from rats and humans were determined. the blood kinetics were determined following iv administration to rats of pgme and pgmea of low [10 and 14.7 mg/kg body weight (bw)] or high (100 and 147 mg/kg) equimolar dosages of pgme and pgmea, respectively. the blood time courses of pgme elimination for both dosages of both compounds were identical. half-lives of pgmea elimination following iv administration of 14.7 or 147 mg pgmea/kg bw were calculated to be 1.6 and 2.3 min, respectively. rat and human in vitro hydrolysis rates of pgmea were determined by incubation of 5 or 50 mug pgmea/ml in whole blood or liver homogenate. the rate of loss of pgmea was more rapid in rat blood than in human blood, with hydrolysis half-lives of 36 and 34 min in human blood and 16 and 15 min in rat blood for the 5 and 50 mug/ml concentrations of pgmea, respectively. in contrast the rate of loss of pgmea in human and rat liver homogenate incubations was similar, 27-30 min and 34 min, respectively. these data demonstrate the rapid hydrolysis of pgmea in vivo to its parent glycol ether, pgme and that, once hydrolyzed, the kinetics for pgme derived from pgmea are identical to that for pgme. this study supports the use of the toxicological database on pgme as a surrogate for pgmea.
northern_blotting	an h+-ppase gene, tsvp from thellungiella halophila, was transferred into two cotton (gossypium hirsutum) varieties (lumianyan19 and lumianyan 21) and southern and northern blotting analysis showed the foreign gene was integrated into the cotton genome and expressed. the measurement of isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles demonstrated that the transgenic plants had higher v-h+-ppase activity compared with wild-type plants (wt). overexpressing tsvp in cotton improved shoot and root growth, and transgenic plants were much more resistant to osmotic/drought stress than the wt. under drought stress conditions, transgenic plants had higher chlorophyll content, improved photosynthesis, higher relative water content of leaves and less cell membrane damage than wt. we ascribe these properties to improved root development and the lower solute potential resulting from higher solute content such as soluble sugars and free amino acids in the transgenic plants. in this study, the average seed cotton yields of transgenic plants from lumianyan 19 and lumianyan 21 were significantly increased compared with those of wt after exposing to drought stress for 21 days at flowering stage. the average seed cotton yields were 51 and 40% higher than in their wt counterparts, respectively. this study benefits efforts to improve cotton yields in arid and semiarid regions.
immunology	previous research has found patients with the fc gamma riiib na1 variant having increased risk of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) resistance in kawasaki disease (kd). our previous studies revealed that elevated fc gamma riia expression correlated with the susceptibility of kd patients. we conducted this research to determine whether and how fc gamma receptors affect the susceptibility, ivig treatment response, and coronary artery lesions (cal) of kd patients. the activating fc gamma riia and inhibitory fc gamma riib methylation levels of seven patients with kd and four control subjects were examined using humanmethylation27 beadchip. we enrolled a total of 44 kd patients and 10 control subjects with fevers. we performed real-time rt-pcr to determine the fc.riia and fc.riib expression levels, as well as a luciferase assay of fc gamma riia. we found a considerable increase in methylation of both fc gamma riia and fc gamma riib in kd patients undergoing ivig treatment. promoter methylation of fc gamma riia inhibited reporter activity in k562 cells using luciferase assay. the fc gamma riib mrna expression levels were not found to increase susceptibility, cal formation, or ivig resistance. fc gamma riia mrna expression levels were significantly higher in ivig-resistant patients than in those that responded to ivig during the pre-treatment period. furthermore, the fc gamma riia/ iib mrna expression ratio was considerably higher in kd patients with cal than in those without cal. fc gamma riia and fc gamma riib both demonstrated increased methylation levels in kd patients that underwent ivig treatment. fc gamma riia expression influenced the ivig treatment response of kd patients. the fc gamma riia/ iib mrna expression ratio was greater in kd patients with cal formation.
genetics	nanoscale biosensors, owing to their high-sensitivity and extremely low limits-of-detection, have enabled the realization of highly complex and sophisticated miniaturized platforms for several important healthcare applications, the most predominant one being disease diagnosis. in particular, nanomaterial facilitated electrochemical detection of dna hybridization has had an exceptional impact on fields such as genetics and cancerous mutation detection here we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical platform using electrospun semi-conducting manganese (iii) oxide (mn2o3) nanofibers for dna hybridization detection. the proposed platform coalesces the inherent advantages of metal-oxide nanofibers and electrochemical transduction techniques, resulting in label-free zeptomolar detection of dna hybridization. as proof of concept, we demonstrate zeptomolar detection of dengue consensus primer (limit of detection: 120x10(-21) m) both in control as well as spiked serum samples. our reported detection limit is superior in comparison with previously reported electrochemical dna hybridization sensors for dengue virus detection, spanning both labeled and label-free transductions. this ultra-sensitivity, we believe, is a result of synthesizing a low bandgap electrospun metal-oxide nanomaterial corresponding to a specific oxidation state of manganese. this methodology can be extended for detection of any hybridization of interest by simply adapting an appropriate functionalization protocol and thus is very generic in nature.
computer-aided_design	the monte carlo method was used for quantitative structure-activity relationships modeling of 36 quinoline/isoquinoline derivatives acting as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. quantitative structure-activity relationships models were calculated with the representation of the molecular structure by the simplified molecular input-line entry system with one random split into the training and the test set. the statistical quality of the developed model was good. the best calculated quantitative structure-activity relationships model had the following statistical parameters: r(2) = 0.9573 for the training set and r(2) = 0.9079 for the test set. structural indicators defined as molecular fragments responsible for increases and decreases in the inhibition activity were calculated. the computer-aided design of new compounds as potential dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors with the application of defined structural alerts was presented.
manufacturing_engineering	increasing quality requirements for functional sports-and work wear make their development more demanding as complex interaction between human physiology and clothing is to be taken adequately into account. previous test designs, often based on subjective perceptions, make a convincing comparison difficult. material-specific laboratory tests only offer limited validity regarding effects on physiological and ergonomic properties. principal objective of the study is to compare two different types of down jackets with respect to their effect on core body temperature during physical activity and inactivity. both jackets were filled with different lining, one with chemically modified down called ""quixdown"" (qd), the other one with conventional down (cd). a climatic chamber test with two activity sessions and a break in between was performed. subjects were physically active on a bike ergometer at moderate level. a total of n = 26 (12m, 14f) healthy and physically active subjects between 18 and 35 years of age were randomly divided into control (cg) and treatment group (tg). tg was equipped with the qd, control group with the cd jacket. to ensure identical loading intensity for the test the individual anaerobic threshold of each subject had been determined in a pretest. each person was equipped with an in-ear thermometer for measuring the core body temperature at the acoustic meatus. with qd jacket the subject 's core body temperature dropped less during the break between both activity sessions than when wearing the cd jacket (p < 0.05, omega(2) = 0.124). no statistical significance could be shown in gender (p = 0.22, omega(2) = 0.02) and interaction jacket/gender (p = 0.56, omega(2) approximate to 0). the chemically modified down insulation seems to offer better thermal insulation than conventional down.

polymerase_chain_reaction	gibel carp carassius auratus gibelio (bloch), a commercially important freshwater-cultured fish in china, is threatened by myxosporeans, particularly thelohanellus wuhanensis, myxobolus honghuensis, m. wulii and m. turpisrotundus. here, we developed a multiplex pcr assay for simultaneous detection of these 4 myxosporeans. the specific primers for each species were designed based on the 28s rdna gene of t. wuhanensis, the its-5.8s rdna of m. honghuensis and m. wulii, and the 18s rdna gene of m. turpisrotundus. specificity testing confirmed that the 4 primer sets have no cross-reactivity with other related myxosporean species tested. detection limits of the multiplex pcr assay were 0.2, 0.3, 3.1 and 3.8 spores for t. wuhanensis, m. honghuensis, m. wulii and m. turpisrotundus, respectively. following screening of 104 field samples, the analytical sensitivity of the present multiplex pcr assay was found to be similar to the sensitivity obtained by the singleplex pcr assays and was higher than that of microscopic examination. moreover, kappa analysis showed a strong agreement between the results of the singleplex and multiplex pcr assays, indicating that the developed multiplex pcr assay was an efficient approach for the diagnosis of the 4 myxosporeans infecting gibel carp.
human_metabolism	the metabolism of a variety of anabolic steroids frequently misused for doping purposes has been investigated in the last years. this research mainly focused on main and long-term metabolites suitable for detection, but detailed clearance mechanisms have rarely been elucidated. recent studies on metandienone focused on the identification of 17 beta-hydroxymethyl-17 alpha-methyl-18-norandrosta-1,4,13-trien-3-one (20 beta oh-normd) as long-term metabolite, however, the metabolic pathway of its generation remained unclear. metandienone and its wagner-meerwein rearrangement product 17,17-dimethyl-18-norandrosta-1,4,13- trien-3-one (normd) were hydroxylated by different human cytochrome p450 enzymes (cyps). some of their hydroxylation products were chemically synthesized and characterized by mass spectrometry to allow for their trace detection in urine samples. following oral administration of metandienone or normd in one human volunteer each the post administration urines were checked for the presence of those hydroxylated metabolites using gc-ms/ms analysis. the human mitochondrial steroid hydroxylating enzymes cyp11b1 and cyp11b2 were capable to metabolize metandienone leading to the formation of 11 beta-hydroxymetandienone and 18-hydroxymetandienone. following wagner-meerwein rearrangement, the resulting products could be assigned to 20 beta oh-normd and 11 beta oh-normd. the contribution of cyp11b1 and cyp11b2 in human metabolism of metandienone was confirmed by analysis of post-administration samples of metandienone and normd. combined with the results from a previous study, enzymatic pathways were identified that involve cyp21 and cyp3a4 in the hydroxylation of normd, while cyp21, cyp3a4 and cyp11b2 take part in 20 beta oh-normd generation from md. the current study represents a valuable contribution to the elucidation of clearance mechanisms of anabolic steroids and also indicates that mainly non-liver cyps seem to be involved in these processes (c) 2012 elsevier ireland ltd. all rights reserved.
genetics	this paper details the design, development and evaluation of an affective tutoring system (ats)-an e-learning system that detects and responds to the emotional states of the learner. research into the development of ats is an active and relatively new field, with many studies demonstrating promising results. however, there is often no practical way to apply these findings in real-world settings. the ats described in this paper utilizes a generic affective application model to infer and appropriately respond to the learner 's affective state. this approach brings several advantages, notably the potential direct support for re-use and retrospective addition of affect sensing functionality into existing e-learning software. skin conductivity and heart rate variability measurements were used to infer affective activation and valence. the evaluation involved an experiment in which the effectiveness of the fully functional ats was compared with that of a nonaffective version, and was conducted with 40 adult participants. the evaluation of the effectiveness of this tutoring system showed that measurable improvements in perceived learning may be obtained with a modest level of software development.
cell_biology	new developments in stem cell biology offer alternatives for the reconstruction of critical-sized bone defects. one of these developments is the use of induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells. these stem cells are similar to embryonic stem (es) cells, but can be generated from adult somatic cells and therefore do not raise ethical concerns. proper characterization of ips-derived osteoblasts is important for future development of safe clinical applications of these cells. for this reason, we differentiated mouse es and ips cells toward osteoblasts using osteogenic medium and compared their functionality. immunocytochemical analysis showed significant expression of bone markers (osteocalcin and collagen type i) in osteoblasts differentiated from es and ips cells on days 7 and 30. an in vitro mineralization assay confirmed the functionality of osteogenically differentiated es and ips cells. gene expression arrays focusing on osteogenic differentiation were performed in order to compare the gene expression pattern in both differentiated and undifferentiated es cells and ips cells. we observed a significant upregulation of osteogenesis-related genes such as runx2, osteopontin, collagen type i, tnfsf11, csf1, and alkaline phosphatase upon osteogenic differentiation of the es and ips cells. we further validated the expression of key osteogenic genes runx2, osteopontin, osteocalcin, collagen type i, and osterix in both differentiated and undifferentiated es and ips cells by means of quantified real-time polymerase chain reaction. we conclude that es and ips cells are similar in their osteogenic differentiation capacities, as well as in their gene expression patterns.
cell_biology	while therapies targeting the co-inhibitory or immune checkpoint receptors pd-1 and ctla-4 have shown remarkable success in many cancers, not all patients benefit from these therapies. this has catalyzed enormous interest in the targeting of other immune checkpoint receptors. in this regard, tigit and cd96 have recently entered the limelight as novel immune checkpoint receptor targets. tigit and cd96 together with the co-stimulatory receptor cd226 form a pathway that is analogous to the cd28/ctla-4 pathway, in which shared ligands and differential receptor: ligand affinities fine-tune the immune response. although the roles of tigit and cd96 as immune checkpoint receptors in t cell and natural killer cell biology are just beginning to be uncovered, accumulating data support the targeting of these receptors for improving anti-tumor immune responses. a clear understanding of the immune cell populations regulated by tigit and cd96 is key to the design of immunotherapies that target these receptors in combination with other existing immune checkpoint blockade therapies.
enzymology	thermophilic enzymes tend to be less catalytically-active at lower temperatures relative to their mesophilic counterparts, despite having very similar crystal structures. an often cited hypothesis for this general observation is that thermostable enzymes have evolved a more rigid tertiary structure in order to cope with their more extreme, natural environment, but they are also less flexible at lower temperatures, leading to their lower catalytic activity under mesophilic conditions. an alternative hypothesis, however, is that complementary thermophilic-mesophilic enzyme pairs simply operate through different evolutionary-optimized catalytic mechanisms. in this communication, we present evidence that while the steps of the catalytic mechanisms for mesophilic and thermophilic indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (igps) enzymes are fundamentally similar, the identity of the rate-determining step changes as a function of temperature. our findings indicate that while product release is rate-determining at 25 degrees c for thermophilic igps, near its adaptive temperature (75 degrees c), a proton transfer event, involving a general acid, becomes rate-determining. the rate-determining steps for thermophilic and mesophilic igps enzymes are also different at their respective, adaptive temperatures with the mesophilic igps-catalyzed reaction being rate-limited before irreversible co2 release, and the thermophilic igps-catalyzed reaction being rate limited afterwards.

thermodynamics	the binding of doxorubicin (dox) to cross-linked pluronic f127-g-paa-egdma and l92-g-paa-egdma microgels at different alpha (alpha) and salt concentrations was investigated using isothermal titration calorimetric (itc), optical and scanning electron microscopic techniques (sem). we seek to elucidate the mechanisms of interaction and the release of dox from cross-linked microgels composed of pluronic and poly (acrylic acid). the itc results indicated a high binding affinity of dox to the microgel, which is a function of salt concentrations due to the impact of electrostatic shielding on the dox-binding process. applying the polyelectrolyte theory allows the decoupling of the gibbs free energy of binding that describes the role of non-electrostatic interaction of dox and the microgel. the presence of dox within the microgel resulted in the collapse of the microgel due to charge shielding, pi-pi interactions and self-association of polymer-bound dox molecules. the diffusion of dox through the microgel is controlled by the dissociation of coo-/dox+ coupling pairs.

thermodynamics	virgin aggregate is heated and dried in a drum dryer and uses this heated mass to heat and dry reclaimed asphalt pavement (rap) and/or recycled asphalt shingles (ras) materials in a drum mixer before blending with virgin asphalt binder. however, often the virgin aggregate temperature inside the dryer is unknown since many dryers do not have a temperature-measuring unit but the mixer has. up to this end, thermodynamics and heat transfer principles are applied to predict virgin aggregate temperatures necessary to dry and heat rap/ras with varying moisture content and for various hot-mix asphalt (hma) mix proportions. among the many results, it is found that for a hma mix consisting of 50% virgin aggregate with 3% moisture content and 50% rap with 5% moisture content, the temperature required to raise the virgin aggregate temperature is 608 degrees c to dry and heat virgin aggregate and rap. for verification purposes, the virgin aggregate temperature is recorded at a drum plant facility, and thermodynamics and heat transfer principles are used to predict the virgin aggregate temperatures. it has been observed that for the hma mix, the temperature predicted for larger-size virgin aggregate shows good agreement with the recorded value.

machine_design	usually an induction machine with closed slots on the rotor has lower harmonics in stator line currents than that with open slots. however, some induction machines with closed-rotor slots may suffer from local saturation in the rotor slot bridges, and thus, exhibit significant low-order time harmonics in the stator currents. such phenomenon is revealed with theoretical analysis, and validated with both finite element analysis and experiments. this study is of reference value for the induction machine design so as to avoid the low-order current harmonics.
materials_engineering	background textbooks play an important role in engineering education, influencing instructors' pedagogical approaches and providing much of the information students learn. research has explored students' recollections of the roles that textbooks played in their educational experiences, but how students actually use textbooks remains largely unexplored. purpose this phenomenological study describes engineering students' textbook use during problem-solving activities. this study directly examined how students employed a textbook in order to generate detailed descriptions of students' behaviors, approaches, and reflections regarding their actual problem-solving experiences. method ten senior materials engineering students (8 males and 2 females) were asked to think aloud while solving engineering problems. follow-up retrospective interviews regarding the think aloud session were conducted to gain in-depth information on students' textbook use during the problem-solving activities. results students used the textbook primarily to find information related to problem constraints that were explicitly stated in the problem. furthermore, textbook example problems exerted a strong influence on students' problem-solving processes. students also reported limitations of the textbook, contrasting it to the diversity of resources available via the internet. conclusions this study provides insight into students' textbook use during engineering problem-solving activities. students' limited application of the textbook during problem solving suggests that textbooks may not be serving their intended purposes.
genetics	lake tanganyika has undergone substantial climate-driven lake level fluctuations that have repeatedly changed the distribution and extent of habitat for endemic fishes. here we consider whether patterns of population genetic structure and phenotypic divergence within the cichlid fish telmatochromis temporalis have been affected by changing lake levels. the species has a large-bodied rock-living ecomorph and a small-bodied shell-living ecomorph, and both are found in close proximity in littoral habitats. using mtdna sequences we found that geographically distant (>50 km) populations within the southern lake region diverged approximately 130,000-230,000 years ago, suggesting that the regional genetic structure persisted through a low stand of over 400 m similar to 106,000 years ago that ended with a rise to present levels similar to 100,000 years ago. we also found signatures of large population expansions since this rise across the study region, suggesting that the populations positively responded to new habitat as lake levels rose to present levels. finally, we found that geographically adjacent (< 10 km) ecomorphs exhibit both significant genetic differentiation and signatures of gene flow after the lake level rise. the results suggest that local ecomorph divergence progressed with gene flow after the last major rise in lake level similar to 100,000, potentially facilitated by new ecological opportunities.
polymerase_chain_reaction	fk506 binding protein (fbbp) 14 belongs to the family of fkbps. altered expression of fkbps are observed in several malignancies. the present study aimed to explore the expression and biological function of fkbp14 in gastric cancer. fkbp14 expression levels in 40 gastric cancer samples and matched control samples were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. cell proliferation was evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay. a cell adhesion and a transwell assay were performed to detect cell adhesion and invasion. protein expression was determined using western blot analysis. it was found that fkbp14 expression in gastric cancer tissues was elevated compared with normal tissues. silencing of fkbp14 expression in the gastric cancer mkn-45 and ags cell lines, which have a higher expression level of fkbp14 compared with four other gastric cancer cell lines, significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, adhesion and invasion. in addition, the protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (emt) markers beta-catenin, snail1 and twist were repressed in gastric cancer cells with fkbp14 silenced. in conclusion, fkbp14 may act as an oncogene by suppressing cellular proliferation, adhesion and invasion and emt in gastric carcinogenesis. fkbp14 may be a diagnosis marker and potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.
human_metabolism	uric acid is the primary end product from purine derivatives in human metabolism. excessive production of uric acid may lead to gout, hyperuricemia and kidney disorder: different analytical methods for uric acid such as colorimetry, commercial enzyme electrode and commercially available uric acid kit are used widely. the main purpose of this research was to develop,a screen printed electrode based uric acid biosensor using gelatin immobilized uricase enzyme extracted from comamonas sp. btua. the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of uric acid in presence of oxygen, producing allantoin and hydrogen peroxide. the linearity of the standard curve in the concentration ranges from 5.94 x 10(-6) to 4.75 x 10(-4) molar was satisfactory and could be used for the quantitative determination of uric acid in human serum samples. the limit of detection (lod) was 2.26 mu m and sensitivity was evaluated as 3.31 na mu m-1 of uric acid. one modified electrode could be used for six measurements with 95%. accuracy up to 25 days. the developed biosensor was easy to use, inexpensive, sensitive and reliable.
thermodynamics	the study of radiation exergy has important significance for solar energy and high-temperature engineering. in this paper, several exergy expressions of blackbody radiation were discussed and the differences between petela 's expression of exergy and two other expressions were analyzed. considering that radiant energy and thermal energy are different, the radiation machine model was established; furthermore, the validity of petela 's formula was indicated by this model. based on the concept of radiation equivalent temperature, the integral form expression of monochromatic photon exergy was put forward by establishing the infinite-staged carnot heat engine model. at the same time, an approximate relation between equivalent temperature and radiation wavelength was given. the error of this relation is negligible when calculating the exergy of blackbody radiation within the temperature range of the engineering field. finally, the monochromatic photon entropy was discussed by considering the infinite-staged carnot heat engine model, and an expression of photon entropy with integral form was given. the monochromatic photon entropy and exergy proposed in our paper satisfy the thermodynamic relation and can reflect the differences between radiant energy and thermal energy.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the management of helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection treatment differs from the common treatment protocol for other infectious diseases. because culture-or molecular-guided approaches face several practical issues, such as the invasive procedures required to obtain gastric biopsy specimens and the lack of availability of routine laboratory testing in some places, h. pylori treatment includes the administration of two or three empirically selected antibiotics combined with a proton pump inhibitor rather than evidence-based eradication treatment. the efficacy of empirical therapy is decreasing, mostly due to increasing multiple resistance. multiresistance to levofloxacin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole, which are commonly used in empirical treatments, appears to have increased in many countries. mutations play a primary role in the antimicrobial resistance of h. pylori, but many different mechanisms can be involved in the development of antibiotic resistance. determining and understanding these possible mechanisms might allow the development of new methods for the detection of h. pylori and the determination of antimicrobial resistance. a treatment based on the detection of antimicrobial resistance is usually more effective than empirical treatment. nevertheless, such an approach before treatment is still not recommended in the maastricht guidelines due to the difficulty associated with the routine application of available culture-or molecular-based susceptibility tests, which are usually administered in cases of treatment failure. the management of first and rescue treatments requires further research due to the steadily increase in antimicrobial resistance.
southern_blotting	more than 1000 different mutations in the ldl receptor gene (ldlr) result in familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). the present study adds to the landscape of molecular heterogeneity of fh in bulgaria the frequency and molecular characteristics of large ldlr rearrangements. the study was done on genomic dna in a group of 32 unrelated patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (plasma total cholesterol level >8.50 mmol/l) by southern blotting analysis. three carriers of large ldlr rearrangements (frequency 0.09 +/- 0.04), and two novel mutations were found - a large inversion involving exons 4, 5 and 6, and a deletion about 4.0 kb of a fragment located between exons 4 and 8 of the ldlr.
southern_blotting	an intronic ggggcc hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (c9orf72) gene was considered as the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and frontotemporal dementia in caucasian populations. using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction analysis and southern blotting methods, we assessed the frequency and size of hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a cohort of 918 sporadic als (sals) patients and 632 control individuals of han chinese origin. we identified 8 (0.87%) of the sals patients and none of control individuals as carriers of c9orf72 expansions with 700-3500 repeats. a comprehensive neuropsychological battery was conducted on 4 expansion-positive als patients, where 3 patients were found to have cognitive impairment. all expansion-positive patients were genotyped for the previously reported 20 single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) risk haplotypes on chromosome 9p21. among them, 13 snp risk haplotypes were shared in all expansion carriers, suggesting a common founder from european ancestry. further meta-analysis demonstrated that the intermediate expansion size with 24-30 repeats, rare in both patients and controls, were significantly associated with the risk for als. to our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a proportion of chinese sals patients carrying this pathologic expansion of up to similar to 3500 repeats and to completely elaborate the 20-snp risk haplotypes in chinese expansion-positive patients, providing indispensable evidence for the origin, geographical range, and population prevalence of the c9orf72-associated als.

molecular_biology	the presence of pesticide residues in food is a public health problem. exposure to these substances in daily life could have serious effects on the intestine-the first organ to come into contact with food contaminants. the present study investigated the impact of a low dose (1 mg/day in oil) of the pesticide chlorpyrifos (cpf) on the community structure, diversity and metabolic response of the human gut microbiota using the shime (r) model (six reactors, representing the different parts of the gastrointestinal tract). the last three reactors (representing the colon) were inoculated with a mixture of feces from human adults. three time points were studied: immediately before the first dose of cpf, and then after 15 and 30 days of cpf-oil administration. by using conventional bacterial culture and molecular biology methods, we showed that cpf in oil can affect the gut microbiota. it had the greatest effects on counts of culturable bacteria (with an increase in enterobacteria, bacteroides spp. and clostridia counts, and a decrease in bifidobacterial counts) and fermentative activity, which were colon-segment-dependent. our results suggest that: (i) cpf in oil treatment affects the gut microbiota (although there was some discordance between the culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses); (ii) the changes are ""shime (r)-compartment"" specific; and (iii) the changes are associated with minor alterations in the production of short-chain fatty acids and lactate.
strength_of_materials	a quaternion is an ordered combination of four real numbers. it can also be expressed as a sum of a scalar and a vector in three dimensional euclidian space. quaternion algebra allows the division of vectors. since the current vector algebra does not allow the division of vectors; in many branches of mechanics, when a vectoral quantity falls to the denominator of an expression, the general tendency is to use its magnitude rather than its vector character. once the vector division is defined by the quaternion algebra, it becomes possible to redrive the equations that have vector quantities in their denominators. in this study, basic equations of stress in strength of materials are reviewed according to the rules of quaternion algebra. it is shown that this new point of view brings a more powerful and consistent system. the normal stress becomes a scalar quantity. area and moment of inertia of a cross-section becomes a vectoral quantity. direction of shearing stresses change and becomes a more consistent convention especially in torsion problems. the most striking results are obtained in shear flow.

enzymology	calcineurin is the only ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. the roles of the cytosolic calcineurin have been well researched; however, the roles of the serum calcineurin remain unknown. here, we report that the recombinant human calcineurin b subunit (cnb) can bind to rabbit platelets and show an antiplatelet aggregation activity. furthermore, cnb exerts an anticoagulant effect by prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time and reducing the plasma fibrinogen concentration in a dose-dependent manner. we further reveal that the functional domain associated with the anticoagulant activity of cnb is located in the c-terminus. hemolysis test and intravenous stimulation study show that the recombinant cnb does not cause obvious hemolysis and is safe for intravenous injection. these results reveal a new function of calcineurin b subunit. they also give an explanation for the roles of calcineurin b subunit in serum and point to a possible implication in antithrombotic therapy.

manufacturing_engineering	time lost due to injury or illness requiring rehabilitation is a major problem. activity is an important part of rehabilitation, however compliance and adherence can be challenging. this paper addresses this issue by presenting an automatic system for monitoring activity allowing objective assessment of the activity. the system consisted of a smartphone based activity capture platform connected wirelessly to back-end server for analysis and storage and a web server to provide a user-friendly interface for feedback and education purposes. the system was validated by comparison with 3 accepted standard measuring devices and found to match their results well. the system also monitored the data of the participants over a continuous period of a number of days. it is evident that human factors play a part in both of the data collection strategies.

internal_combustion_engine	often employed in the analysis of conventional si and ci engines, mathematical models can also be applied to engines with torch ignition, which have been researched almost exclusively by cfd or experimentally. the objective of this work is to describe the development and application of a zero dimensional model of the compression and power strokes of a torch ignited engine. it is an initial analysis that can be used as a basis for future models. the processes of compression, combustion and expansion were described mathematically and applied to an existing prototype by means of a computer code written in matlab language. conservation of energy and mass and the ideal gas law were used in determining gas temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate within the cylinder. gas motion through the orifice was modelled as an isentropic compressible flow. the thermodynamic properties of the mixture were round by a weighted arithmetic mean of the data for each component, computed by polynomial functions of temperature. combustion was modelled by the wiebe function. heat transfer to the cylinder walls was estimated by annand 's correlations. results revealed the behaviour of pressure, temperature, jet velocity, energy transfer, thermodynamic properties, among other variables, and how some of these are influenced by others.

immunology	leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by mycobacterium leprae. according to official reports from 121 countries across five who regions, there were 213 899 newly diagnosed cases in 2014. although leprosy affects the skin and peripheral nerves, it can present across a spectrum of clinical and histopathological forms that are strongly influenced by the immune response of the infected individuals. these forms comprise the extremes of tuberculoid leprosy (tt), with a m. leprae-specific th1, but also a th17, response that limits m. leprae multiplication, through to lepromatous leprosy (ll), with m. leprae-specific th2 and t regulatory responses that do not control m. leprae replication but rather allow bacterial dissemination. the interpolar borderline clinical forms present with similar, but less extreme, immune biases. acute inflammatory episodes, known as leprosy reactions, are complications that may occur before, during or after treatment, and cause further neurological damages that can cause irreversible chronic disabilities. this review discusses the innate and adaptive immune responses, and their interactions, that are known to affect pathogenesis and influence the clinical outcome of leprosy.
immunology	corneal immunoimaging and neuroimaging approaches facilitate in vivo analyses of the cornea, including high-resolution imaging of corneal immune cells and nerves. this approach facilitates the analyses of underlying immune and nerve alterations not detected by clinical slit-lamp examination alone. in this review, we describe recent work performed in our translational ocular immunology center with a focus on ""bench-to-bedside"" and ""bedside-to-bench"" research. the ability to visualize dendritiform immune cells (dcs) in patients with laser in vivo confocal microscopy (ivcm), recently discovered in the central murine cornea, has allowed us to demonstrate their utility as a potential surrogate biomarker for inflammatory ocular surface diseases. this biomarker for inflammation allows the measurement of therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs and its utility as an endpoint in clinical trials with high interobserver agreement. ivcm image analyses from our studies has demonstrated a significant increase in dc density and size in ocular disease, a positive correlation between dc density and clinical signs and symptoms of disease and pro-inflammatory tear cytokines, and a strong negative correlation between dc density and subbasal nerve density. in conjunction with preclinical research investigating the inflammatory state in a partial or fully denervated cornea, our results indicated that corneal nerves are directly involved in the regulation of homeostasis and immune privilege in the cornea.
polymerase_chain_reaction	mutations in the connection and rnase h c-terminal reverse transcriptase (rt) domains of hiv-1 have been shown to impact drug resistance to rt inhibitors. however, their impact in the context of non-b subtypes has been poorly assessed. this study aimed to characterize resistance-related mutations in the c-terminal portions of rt in treatment-failing patients from southern brazil, a region with endemic hiv-1 subtype c (hiv-1c). viral rna was isolated and reverse transcribed from 280 infected subjects, and genomic regions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, dna sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. two novel mutations, m357r and e529d, were evidenced in brazilian hiv-1c strains from treatment-failing patients. in global viral isolates of subjects on treatment, m357r was selected in hiv-1c and crf01_ae and e529d was selected in hiv-1 subtype b (hiv-1b). while most c-terminal rt mutations described for hiv-1b also occur in hiv-1c, this work pinpointed novel mutations that display subtype-specific predominance or occurrence.
polymerase_chain_reaction	interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (ifitm) family proteins are antivirus factors. in the present study, we examined the expression pattern of chicken ifitm10 using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. in adult chickens, ifitm10 levels were markedly lower than those of ifitm3, which exhibits antivirus activity. on the other hand, ifitm10 was expressed in levels similar to those of ifitm3 in embryonic organs. primordial germ cells in 2.5-d embryos expressed high levels of ifitm10, which gradually decreased with time. the interferon- stimulation of embryonic fibroblast cells did not enhance the expression of ifitm10. the forced expression of ifitm10 slightly inhibited the infectivity of the vsv-g-pseudotyped lentiviral vector. furthermore, cell fusion was inhibited by ifitm10 when hela cells transfected with the vsv-g expression vector were treated with low ph buffer. although it remains unclear whether ifitm10 inhibits viral infections under physiological conditions, these results suggest that chicken ifitm10 exhibits antivirus activity.
genetics	human body and head lice are highly related haematophagous ectoparasites but only the body louse has been shown to transmit bartonella quintana, the causative agent of trench fever. the mechanisms by which body lice became a vector for b. quintana, however, are poorly understood. following oral challenge, green fluorescent protein-expressing b. quintana proliferated over 9 days postchallenge with the number of bacteria being significantly higher in whole body vs. head lice. the numbers of b. quintana detected in faeces from infected lice, however, were approximately the same in both lice. nevertheless, the viability of b. quintana was significantly higher in body louse faeces. comparison of immune responses in alimentary tract tissues revealed that basal transcription levels of peptidoglycan recognition protein and defensins were lower in body lice and the transcription of defensin 1 was up-regulated by oral challenge with wild-type b. quintana in head but not in body lice. in addition, the level of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species generated by epithelial cells was significantly lower in body lice. although speculative at this time, the reduced immune response is consistent with the higher vector competence seen in body vs. head lice in terms of b. quintana infection.
northern_blotting	bone morphogenetic protein-2 (bmp-2) participates significantly in vascular development and pathophysiological processes. angiotensin ii (angii) has been demonstrated to be critical in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. however, the effects of angii on bmp-2 expression and of probucol on the angii-induced bmp-2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) are unknown. the aim of our study was to investigate these effects. huvecs were cultured and stimulated with various agents. the total superoxide dismutase (sod) activity and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (mda) and bmp-2 were measured by standard methods. northern blotting was used to detect the expression of bmp-2 mrna. the activation of nf-kappa b in the huvecs was also determined. the angii treatment significantly increased bmp-2 expression levels and activated nf-kappa b. these effects were suppressed by treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc) or probucol. furthermore, the increased levels of mda in the conditioned medium and the decrease in the total sod activity caused by the angii treatment were reversed by treatment with probucol or pdtc. probucol downregulated the angii-nduced bmp-2 expression. these effects of probucol may be mediated by the inhibition of nf-kappa b activation.
hydraulics	seed dehydration is the normal terminal event in the development of orthodox seeds and is physiologically related to the cessation of grain dry mass accumulation and crop grain yield. for a better understanding of grain dehydration, we evaluated the hypothesis that hydraulic conductance of the ear decreases during the latter stages of development and that this decrease results from disruption or occlusion of xylem conduits. whole ear, rachis, and stem nodes hydraulic conductance and percentage loss of xylem conductivity were measured from flowering to harvest-ripeness on bread wheat (triticum aestivum l.) cv. recital grown under controlled environments. flag leaf transpiration, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and grain and ear water potentials were also measured during grain development. we show that grain dehydration was not related with whole plant physiology and leaf senescence, but closely correlated with the hydraulic properties of the xylem conduits irrigating the grains. indeed, there was a substantial decrease in rachis hydraulic conductance at the onset of the grain dehydration phase. this hydraulic impairment was not caused by the presence of air embolism in xylem conduits of the stern internodes or rachis but by the occlusion of the xylem lumens by polysaccharides (pectins and callose). our results demonstrate that xylem hydraulics plays a key role during grain maturation.
immunology	determining individual health status is of great importance for a better understanding of life history trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and maintenance. however, existing immunological methods are invasive and therefore not suitable for investigating health status in wild populations. thus, there is an urgent need for non-invasive methods to assess the immune status of animals. neopterin is involved in the cell-mediated pathway of the immune response (th1-type), secreted during the activation of monocytes and macrophages. we investigated if urinary neopterin could serve as a biomarker of health status in bonobos and chimpanzees. first, we performed a chemical validation of a commercial neopterin enzyme immune assay (eia) for bonobo and chimpanzee urine. we then examined if urinary neopterin levels in bonobos increase during the acute period of respiratory infections. we found that neopterin levels can be reliably measured in urine of the two species with a commercial eia. stability experiments revealed considerable changes in urinary neopterin levels in relation to multiple freezethaw cycles and extended exposure to room temperature. exposure to sunlight led to a degradation of urinary neopterin, whereas sample storage up to two years did not affect urinary neopterin levels. there was no detectable diurnal variation in neopterin levels, and levels remained very stable across several days in healthy individuals. while urinary neopterin levels were independent of sex, nonadult individuals had higher urinary neopterin levels than adults. most importantly, there was a significant increase in urinary neopterin levels during a period of respiratory infection. our results demonstrate that regular urine sample collection would allow for the monitoring of individual health status and disease progression with minimal disturbance of the subjects. in combination with behavioral, life history, and endocrinological parameters, the method can be used to investigate questions related to immunocompetence handicaps or life history trade-offs.
materials_engineering	in the scope of this study, microstructure-macroproperty relationship of cement mortars has been established in order to define the effects of microstructural phases on strength. microstructural studies have been become great issue in materials engineering. nowadays, to characterize the microstructural phase properties and to improve and modify them are performed by scientist to forecasting and enhancing. according to this objective, cement mortars incorporating with chemical admixtures were prepared to constitute different microstructural graphs. these micrographs were analyzed to determine the amounts of unhydrated cement part, undifferentiated hydrated part and capillary pore phases in the cement mortar sections. afterwards, the amounts of these microstructural phases were related to strength values of each cement mortar specimen. the relationship was established by using generalized regression neural network analysis.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has been recognized as a promising sewage treatment approach. considering the susceptibility, it is meaningful to study the behaviors of anammox bacteria under the unfavorable conditions. here, we found that anammox bacteria more probably tended to aggregation by the regulation of c-di-gmp against the unfavorable environmental stresses (low temperature, aerobic condition and low ph). further using multiple protein sequence alignment, we systematically examined the functionality of thirteen genes encoding putative c-di-gmp metabolic enzymes in anammox organism candidatus jettenia caeni, revealing most of the predicted enzymes were predicted to be active. particularly, ectopic expression of jcaa, a gene encoding a protein with both ggdef domain and eal domain, suggested that it encoded a functional enzyme capable of both synthesizing and degrading c-di-gmp, which was clearly confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was simulated by the means of three-dimensional homology modeling and molecular docking. the identification of cdi-gmp turnover and its role in granulation for anammox organism provides a new perspective for regulation of its aggregation capability and further promotion of anammox performance in the application of wastewater treatment process.

molecular_biology	introduction: at present, treatment of diabetic kidney disease (dkd) is still mainly based on drugs acting on glycemic and blood pressure control, as there is no validated therapy able to halt the progression of renal failure. because of the high incidence of dkd, due to the increase of diabetes mellitus in general population, new therapeutic strategies are needed.areas covered: we analysed ongoing and already completed clinical trials, from clinicaltrials.gov and pubmed, dealing with new therapies for dkd.expert opinion: among the drugs currently being explored, the most promising molecules are those that interfere with glucose-dependent pathways, in particular polyol, protein kinase, hexosamine and ages metabolic pathways, and impaired renal vascular regulation. one of the recent goals achieved by molecular biology is the development of monoclonal antibodies able to interfere with extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. other interesting therapies are under investigation and further studies with a greater number of patients will establish a better approach for diabetic nephropathy.
machine_design	in the last few decades, rectangle earth pressure balance shield machine have been introduced as primary tunneling tools in soft soil excavation around the world. this paper presents research on the performance of the rectangle shield machine. analytical studies have been carried out to establish the relation between rectangle shield machine design key parameters, such as segments support, tail thickness and soil layer harness, and the strength, stiffness and buckling analysis of the shell structure. the results of these are presented. and the results show that good stiffness, displacement and stability capacities have been achieved.
enzymology	pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) expresses a secreted lipoxygenase (lox), which oxygenates free arachidonic acid predominantly to 15s-h(p)ete. the enzyme is capable of binding phospholipids at its active site and physically interacts with model membranes. however, its membrane oxygenase activity has not been quantified. to address this question, we overexpressed pa-lox as intracellular his-tag fusion protein in escherichia coli, purified it to electrophoretic homogeneity and compared its biomembrane oxygenase activity with that of rabbit alox15. we found that both enzymes were capable of oxygenating mitochondrial membranes to specific oxygenation products and 13s-h(p)ode and 15s-h(p)ete esterified to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were identified as major oxygenation products. when normalized to similar linoleic acid oxygenase activity, the rabbit enzyme exhibited a much more effective mitochondrial membrane oxygenase activity. in contrast, during long-term incubations (24 h) with red blood cells pa-lox induced significant (50%) hemolysis whereas rabbit alox15 was more or less ineffective. these data indicate the principle capability of pa-lox of oxygenating membrane bound phospholipids which is likely to alter the barrier function of the biomembranes. although the membrane oxygenase activity was lower than the fatty acid oxygenase activity of pa-lox red blood cell membrane oxygenation might be of biological relevance for p. aeruginosa septicemia.

materials_engineering	ability to design metal forming processes requires knowledge of continuum mechanics and materials engineering. the papers presents the results of research on the complete analysis of the forging process of microalloyed steel. the forging process assessment was performed based on thermomechanical calculations and using microstructural modeling. hardness tests were employed for the verification of computed results. a method of predicting the relation between quality of final product and history of metal forming as well as microstructural development using an fem simulation is also presented here. the results of the fem-simulation for the forging process and material are compared with experimental data to show the feasibility of the proposed method. finally, it is stated that by using properly built software it is possible to eliminate brittle cracking in the forged products, especially at low temperatures.
molecular_biology	telomerase activation is critical in many cancers including central nervous system (cns) tumors. imetelstat is an oligonucleotide that binds to the template region of the rna component of telomerase, inhibiting its enzymatic activity. we conducted an investigator-sponsored molecular biology (mb) and phase ii study to estimate inhibition of tumor telomerase activity and sustained responses by imetelstat in children with recurrent cns malignancies. in the mb study, patients with recurrent medulloblastoma, high-grade glioma (hgg) or ependymoma undergoing resection received one dose of imetelstat as a 2-h intravenous infusion at 285 mg/m(2), 12-24 h before surgery. telomerase activity was evaluated in fresh tumor from surgery. post-surgery and in the phase ii study, patients received imetelstat iv (days 1 and 8 q21-days) at 285 mg/m(2). imetelstat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed. of two evaluable patients on the mb trial, intratumoral telomerase activity was inhibited by 95 % compared to baseline archival tissue in one patient and was inevaluable in one patient. forty-two patients (40 evaluable for toxicity) were enrolled: 9 medulloblastomas, 18 hgg, 4 ependymomas, 9 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. most common grade 3/4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia (32.5 %), lymphopenia (17.5 %), neutropenia (12.5 %), alt (7.5 %) and ast (5 %) elevation. two patients died of intratumoral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia leading to premature study closure. no objective responses were observed. telomerase inhibition was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) for at least 8 days. imetelstat demonstrated intratumoral and pbmc target inhibition; the regimen proved too toxic in children with recurrent cns tumors.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper describes the energy management controller design of a mid-sized vehicle driven by a fuel cell/battery plug-in hybrid powertrain, where an experimentally validated hight temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell model is used. the power management strategy is derived by the application of the pontryagin 's minimum principle, where the control parameter is adapted by using feedback information on the state of charge and total trip length forecast as a function of a moving average of past information about the driving cycle speed. the strategy we propose aims at achieving a real time suboptimal solution of the control problem which is cast into the minimization of the consumed fuel. the vehicle is also equipped by an auto-thermal reformer and, in order to minimize the hydrogen buffer size, the control algorithm is subject to constraints on the maximum hydrogen buffer level. a comparative analysis of the proposed strategy against the optimal one is conducted and results are reported. the obtained fuel consumptions are also compared to those obtained by the same vehicle, powered by an internal combustion engine and by a plug-in hybrid electric powertrain.

northern_blotting	background: micrornas (mirnas) are small noncoding rnas whose function as modulators of gene expression is crucial for the proper control of cell growth. although many micrornas were found to express in central nervous system (cns), the role of the regulatory networks in which they are involved and their function in the pathological process of nerve cells are only just emerging. in the present study, the possible mechanisms by which one neuronal mirnas, mir-125b, affected the growth of nervous cells were investigated using in vitro cell line model. methods: the expression pattern of mir-125b in atra-treated human glioma cell lines was detected by northern blotting and in situ localization. the effect of mir-125b on the proliferation and apoptosis of human glioma cells was analyzed by mts assay, tunel and flow cytometry analysis. in addition, the identification of target gene of mir-125b was studied by dual-luciferase activity assay and immunoblot analysis. results: we found differential expression of mir-125b in 1.0 mu m all-trans-retinoic acid (atra)-treated human glioma cell lines. up-regulation of mir-125b partially restored cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in u343 cells treated by atra. down-regulation of mir125b decreased human glioma cells proliferation and enhanced the sensitivity of human glioma cells to atra-induced apoptosis. in addition, we found an inverse relationship between the expression of mir125b and the cell apoptosis-related protein bcl-2 modifying factor (bmf), and mir-125b can interact with 3'-untranslated region (utr) of bmf. conclusion: these findings indicate that overexpression of mir125b promotes human glioma cell proliferation and inhibits atra-induced cell apoptosis and low expression of mir-125b sensitizes cells to atra-induced apoptosis. bmf may play an important role in the process of mir-125b influencing cell apoptosis. copyright (c) 2009 s. karger ag, basel
human_metabolism	the change in serum metabolic response from fasting state to postprandial state provides novel insights into the impact of a single meal on human metabolism. therefore, this study explored changes in serum metabolite profile after a single meal. nineteen healthy postmenopausal women with normal glucose tolerance participated in the study. they received a meal consisting of refined wheat bread (50 g carbohydrates, 9 g protein, 4.2 g fat and 2.7 g dietary fibre), 40 g cucumber and 300 ml noncaloric orange drink. blood samples were collected at fasting and five postprandial time points. metabolic profile was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance and targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. changes over time were assessed with multivariate models and anova, with baseline as control. the metabolomic analyses demonstrated alterations in phospholipids, amino acids and their breakdown products, glycolytic products, acylcarnitines and ketone bodies after a single meal. more specifically, phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and citrate displayed an overall declining pattern, while leucine, isoleucine, methionine and succinate increased initially but declined thereafter. a sharp decline in acylcarnitines and ketone bodies and increase in glycolytic products postprandially suggest a switch in the body 's energy source from beta-oxidation to glycolysis. moreover, individuals with relatively high postprandial insulin responses generated a higher postprandial leucine responses compared to participants with lower insulin responses. the study demonstrated complex changes from catabolic to anabolic metabolism after a meal and indicated that the extent of postprandial responses is different between individuals with high and low insulin response.
enzymology	rapidly multiplying cancer cells synthesize greater amounts of cholesterol to build their membranes. cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) are currently in clinical trials for anti-cancer chemotherapy. however, given at higher doses, statins cause serious side effects by inhibiting the formation of other biologically important molecules derived from mevalonate. sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (cyp51), which acts 10 steps downstream, is potentially a more specific drug target because this portion of the pathway is fully committed to cholesterol production. however, screening a variety of commercial and experimental inhibitors of microbial cyp51 orthologs revealed that most of them (including all clinical antifungals) weakly inhibit human cyp51 activity, even if they display high apparent spectral binding affinity. only one relatively potent compound, (r)-n-(1-(3,4'-difluorobiphenyl-4-yl)-2-(1h-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)-4-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) benzamide (vfv), was identified. vfv has been further tested in cellular experiments and found to decrease proliferation of different cancer cell types.(jlr) the crystal structures of human cyp51-vfv complexes (2.0 and 2.5 angstrom) both display a 2:1 inhibitor/enzyme stoichiometry, provide molecular insights regarding a broader substrate profile, faster catalysis, and weaker susceptibility of human cyp51 to inhibition, and outline directions for the development of more potent inhibitors.-hargrove, t. y., l. friggeri, z. wawrzak, s. sivakumaran, e. m. yazlovitskaya, s. w. hiebert, f. p. guengerich, m. r. waterman, and g. i. lepesheva. human sterol 14 alpha-demethylase as a target for anticancer chemotherapy:towards structure-aided drug design.
machine_design	recently, vernier permanent magnet (vpm) machines, one special case of magnetic flux-modulated (mfm) machines, benefiting from their compact, simple construction and low-speed/high-torque characteristics, have been receiving increasing interest. in this paper, the vernier structure is integrated with an axial-flux pm machine to obtain the magnetic gear effect and produce an improved torque density for direct-drive wind power generation application. another advantage of the proposed machine is that the stator flux rotating speed can be relatively high when the shaft speed is low. with this benefit, sensorless control strategy can be easily implemented in a wide speed range. in this paper, an improved sliding mode observer (smo) is proposed to estimate the rotor position and the speed of the proposed machine. with the estimated shaft speeds, the maximum power point tracking (mppt) control strategy is applied to maximize the wind power extraction. the machine design and the sensorless mppt control strategy are verified by finite element analysis and experimental verification.
materials_engineering	atomic-scale tomography (ast) is defined and its place in microscopy is considered. arguments are made that ast, as defined, would be the ultimate microscopy. the available pathways for achieving ast are examined and we conclude that atom probe tomography (apt) may be a viable basis for ast on its own and that apt in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy is a likely path as well. some possible configurations of instrumentation for achieving ast are described. the concept of metaimages is introduced where data from multiple techniques are melded to create synergies in a multidimensional data structure. when coupled with integrated computational materials engineering, structure-properties microscopy is envisioned. the implications of ast for science and technology are explored.
polymerase_chain_reaction	mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (mo) is main responsible for pleuropneumonia in sheep. the disease is spreading in the world, and has caused great suffering and losses to the sheep husbandry. current methodologies for detecting and identifying mo are somehow time consuming, complicated, expensive. herein, a powerful biosensing platform for effective mo detection has been explored based on manganese dioxide (mno2) microsphere absorbing cy5 labeled single strand dna (cy5-ssdna) probe, in which different base number of the complementary of mo conserved sequence was employed. the results demonstrated that the fluorescence enhancement exhibited a good linear relationship with mo plasmid added over a concentration range of 10(2)-10(6) copies/mu l, with the detection limit of 1.042 copies/mu l. this biosensing platform has been finally employed as the feasible probe for mo plasmid and detection with good reproducibility and stability, which exhibited a good performance to discriminate perfect complementary target mo and the base mismatched dna sequence, illustrated that using mno2 microsphere absorbing cy5-ssdna probe as biosensor can detect mo in simple, rapid, economical, selective and sensitive way, and showed significantly potential in more extensive biochemical application.

machine_design	the main issue of higher education in the czech republic relating to mechanical engineering is currently the lack of opportunities for students to acquire practical knowledge and experience in the field during their studies. moreover, engineering companies in the czech republic are often reluctant to share their knowhow with universities, meaning that the study of machine design is isolated from practice in engineering companies. one way to deal with these issues is to improve different aspects of teaching technical subjects in order to improve the quality, efficiency, comprehensibility and attractiveness of machine design. the faculty of mechanical engineering at the university of west bohemia (fme) has launched the machine design teaching enhancement project (tep) whose goal is to provide students and academics at fme with quality learning materials. learning materials concerned with teaching of computer aided engineering (cae) systems were developed as a part of tep. these step-by-step learning materials promote self-study and make learning cae systems much easier for students. another part of tep is concerned with developing a new concept of project-based learning materials based on interactive cae models. the learning materials have been developed by academics in cooperation with local engineering companies and software developers. this paper presents these learning materials and their advantages for students and academics at fme.
fluid_mechanics	microgravity experiments are essential for research in space science, biology, fluid mechanics, combustion, and material sciences. one way to conduct microgravity experiments on earth is by using drop tower facilities. these facilities combine a high quality of microgravity, adequate payload masses and have the advantage of virtually unlimited repeatability under same experimental conditions, at a low cost. in a collaboration between the institute of space systems (irs) at the university of stuttgart and baylor university (bu) in waco, texas, a new drop tower is currently under development at the center for astrophysics, space physics and engineering research (casper). the design parameters of the drop tower ask for at least 1.5 sin free fall duration while providing a quality of at least 10(-5) g. previously, this quality has only been achieved in vacuum drop tower facilities where the capsule experiences virtually zero aerodynamic drag during its free fall. since this design comes at high costs, a different drop tower design concept, which does not require an evacuated drop shaft, was chosen. it features a dual-capsule system in which the experiment capsule is shielded from aerodynamic forces by surrounding it with a drag shield during the drop. as no other dual-capsule drop tower has been able to achieve a quality as good as or better than 10-5 g previous work optimized the design with an aerodynamic perspective by using computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulations to determine the ideal shape and size of the outer capsule and to specify the aerodynamically crucial dimensions for the overall system. experiments later demonstrated that the required quality of microgravity can be met with the proposed design. the main focus of this paper is the mechanical realization of the capsule as well as the development and layout of the surrounding components, such as the release mechanism, the deceleration device and the drop shaft. because the drop tower facility is a complex system with many interdependencies between all of the components, several engineering challenges had to be addressed. for example, initial disturbances that are caused by the release mechanism are a common issue that arises at drop tower facilities. these vibrations may decrease the quality of microgravity during the initial segment of free fall. because this would reduce the free fall time experiencing high quality microgravity, a mechanism has been developed to provide a soft release. challenges and proposed solutions for all components are highlighted in this paper.
human_metabolism	manganese is an essential nutrient for human metabolism; however, few studies have been conducted to establish the dietary recommended intake (dri) for manganese. the purpose of this study is to provide data that can inform the manganese intake level and address the ri by analyzing the manganese intake of 513 young korean adults and evaluating the blood levels and estimated manganese balance of 51 selected subjects. the average age of the total subjects was 22.6 years for men and 21.6 years for women. the average daily energy intake was 1,758.50 kcal for men and 1,578.5 kcal for women. in addition, the daily manganese intake was 3,772.7 mu g for men and 3,444.2 mu g for women. the manganese intake of all subjects was lower than the tolerable upper intake. the manganese intake, excretion through urine and feces, retention amount, and retention rate of the selected subjects were 2,922.8 mu g, 2,612.2 mu g, 331.1 mu g, and 6.7%, respectively, with no significant difference between men and women except urinary excretion (0.34 mu g for men vs. 0.18 mu g for women, p < 0.05). the manganese intake was positively related with the intakes of food, energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate. also, the manganese retention amount was positively related with the intakes of energy, protein, and fat. these results show that both food intake and energy intake are important factors for manganese intake and retention.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objectives to determine the effects of dental implant surface chemistry and energy on macrophage activation invitro. materials and methods disks made from two clinically used implant materials (titanium [ti], titanium zirconium alloy [tizr]) were produced with two different surface treatments (sandblast/acid-etch [sla], hydrophilic-sla [modsla]). surface roughness, energy, and chemistry were characterized. primary murine macrophages were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old male c57bl/6 mice and cultured on test surfaces (ti sla, tizr sla, ti modsla, tizr modsla) or control tissue culture polystyrene. mrna was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction after 24h of culture. pro- (il-1, il-6, and tnf-) and anti-inflammatory (il-4, il-10) protein levels were measured by elisa after 1 or 3days of culture. results quantitatively, microroughness was similar on all surfaces. qualitatively, nanostructures were present on modsla surfaces that were denser on ti than on tizr. modsla surfaces were determined hydrophilic (high-energy surface) while sla surfaces were hydrophobic (low-energy surface). cells on high-energy surfaces had higher levels of mrna from anti-inflammatory markers characteristic of m2 activation compared to cells on low-energy surfaces. this effect was enhanced on the tizr surfaces when compared to cells on ti sla and ti modsla. macrophages cultured on tizr sla and modsla surfaces released more anti-inflammatory cytokines. conclusions the combination of high-energy and altered surface chemistry present on tizr modsla was able to influence macrophages to produce the greatest anti-inflammatory microenvironment and reduce extended pro-inflammatory factor release.
cell_biology	epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt) is associated with metastasis formation as well as with generation and maintenance of cancer stem cells. in this way, emt contributes to tumor invasion, heterogeneity and chemoresistance. morphological and functional changes involved in these processes require robust reprogramming of gene expression, which is only partially accomplished at the transcriptional level. alternative splicing is another essential layer of gene expression regulation that expands the cell proteome. this step in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression tightly controls cell identity between epithelial and mesenchymal states and during stem cell differentiation. importantly, dysregulation of splicing factor function and cancer-specific splicing isoform expression frequently occurs in human tumors, suggesting the importance of alternative splicing regulation for cancer biology. in this review, we briefly discuss the role of emt programs in development, stem cell differentiation and cancer progression. next, we focus on selected examples of key factors involved in emt and stem cell differentiation that are regulated post-transcriptionally through alternative splicing mechanisms. lastly, we describe relevant oncogenic splice-variants that directly orchestrate cancer stem cell biology and tumor emt, which may be envisioned as novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
immunology	the skin can serve as an interstitial na+ reservoir. local tissue na+ accumulation increases with age, inflammation and infection. this increased local na+ availability favors pro-inflammatory immune cell function and dampens their anti-inflammatory capacity. in this review, we summarize available data on how nacl affects various immune cells. we particularly focus on how salt promotes pro-inflammatory macrophage and t cell function and simultaneously curtails their regulatory and anti-inflammatory potential. overall, these findings demonstrate that local na+ availability is a promising novel regulator of immunity. hence, the modulation of tissue na+ levels bears broad therapeutic potential: increasing local na+ availability may help in treating infections, while lowering tissue na+ levels may be used to treat, for example, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.
machine_design	the paper presents a design procedure for tangentially magnetized variable flux machines that aims to reduce the machine inverter rating. the proposed design can achieve high torque density at low speeds, and high efficiency at an extended speed range, as armature d-axis current pulses are applied at high speeds to reduce the magnet flux, thus avoiding the flux weakening current in conventional permanent magnet synchronous (pmsms) machines. in order to regain the full torque capability when the motor slows down, a magnetizing current pulse has to be applied. the amplitude of the magnetizing current is usually larger than the machine rated current. therefore, the machine might need an oversized inverter in order to be able to re-magnetize the magnets. the impact of different machine design parameters on the magnetization current requirement is investigated in order to reduce the inverter cost.
immunology	phagocytes display marked heterogeneity in their capacity to induce and control acute inflammation. this has a significant impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial immune responses at different tissue sites as well as their predisposition for inflammation-associated pathology. imaging flow cytometry provides novel opportunities for characterization of these phagocyte populations through high spatial resolution, statistical robustness, and a broad range of quantitative morphometric cell analysis tools. this study highlights an integrative approach that brings together new tools in imaging flow cytometry with conventional methodologies for characterization of phagocyte responses during acute inflammation. we focus on a comparative avian in vivo challenge model to showcase the added depth gained through these novel quantitative multiparametric approaches even in the absence of antibody-based cellular markers. our characterization of acute inflammation in this model shows significant conservation of phagocytic capacity among avian phagocytes compared to other animal models. however, it also highlights evolutionary divergence with regards to phagocyte inflammation control mechanisms based on the internalization of apoptotic cells.

polymerase_chain_reaction	accurate identification of plant pathogens is crucial towards developing sustainable control strategies to ensure sustainable economic agricultural production. the aim of this study was to detect and characterize potato virus y (pvy) isolates infecting potato (solanum tuberosum l.) in the msinga district in the province of kwazulu-natal, south africa. potato leaf samples exhibiting virus-like symptoms were collected from four different areas in the district. initial detection of pvy in the leaf samples was done using triple antibody sandwich elisa. pvy-positive samples were further tested using antibodies specific to pvy serotypes o and n. nicotiana tabacum cv samsun plants were individually mechanically inoculated with all 32 pvy-elisa positive samples. symptoms on inoculated tobacco plants were monitored over a 4-week period. they consisted of vein clearing, faint mosaic patterns, and the veinal necrosis, symptoms characteristic of pvyn, pvy(n)wilga and pvyntn strains. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using primers specific to the coat protein gene of pvy, was performed as a confirmation test on total rna of four randomly selected pvy-elisa positive samples, each sample representing each of the four areas surveyed. strains pvyn and pvyo were identified. the second part of the study aimed to analyse the full genome sequences of the pvy isolates a4, kd2, mod1 and snep3, in order to understand the evolution of the virus in msinga. to achieve this, total rna, extracted from tobacco leaves (n. tabacum cv samsun) that had been inoculated with the selected four pvy isolates, was used as a template for next generation sequencing (ngs). ngs was run on illumina hiseq using paired-end chemistry 125 x 125bp reads. de novo assembly of the generated reads was performed. the resulting contigs were subjected to blast on the genbank database in order to identify pvy genomes. the pvy isolates were aligned with closely related non-recombinant pvy sequences comprising of the following strains: pvyn, pvyo, pvyntn, and pvyc. recombination events were assessed using rdp4 software. phylogenetic results revealed that pvy isolate snep3 belonged to the pvyntn strain while isolate pvymod1 to the pvy n wilga strain group. recombination analyses confirmed the occurrence of pvy recombinant strains in the msinga district. the widespread presence of pvy and occurrence of recombinant strains in msinga has serious implications on the management of pvy diseases by small-scale farmers growing potato for a livelihood.

northern_blotting	we have characterized the expression of micrornas and selected microrna precursors within several synaptic fractions of adult mouse forebrain, including synaptoneurosomes, synaptosomes and isolated post-synaptic densities (psds), using methods of microrna microarray, real time qrt-pcr, northern blotting and immunopurification using anti-psd95 antibody. the majority of brain micrornas (especially micrornas known to be expressed in pyramidal neurons) are detectably expressed in synaptic fractions, and a subset of micrornas is significantly enriched in synaptic fractions relative to total forebrain homogenate. microrna precursors are also detectable in synaptic fractions at levels that are comparable to whole tissue. whereas mature micrornas are predominantly associated with soluble components of the synaptic fractions, microrna precursors are predominantly associated with psds. for seven micrornas examined, there was a significant correlation between the relative synaptic enrichment of the precursor and the relative synaptic enrichment of the corresponding mature microrna. these findings support the proposal that micrornas are formed, at least in part, via processing of microrna precursors locally within dendritic spines. dicer is expressed in psds but is enzymatically inactive until conditions that activate calpain cause its liberation; thus, we propose that synaptic stimulation may lead to local processing of microrna precursors in proximity to the synapse.
genetics	congenital atrial septal defect (asd) and progressive atriventricular block (avb) are the two most common phenotypes linked to nk2 homeobox 5 (nkx2.5) mutations in animals and humans. however, the prevalence and spectrum of nkx2.5 mutation in patients with asd and avb remain to be elucidated. in the present study, the coding exons and flanking introns of the nkx2.5 gene, which encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor essential for development of the heart, were sequenced in a cohort of 62 unrelated patients with asd and avb, and subsequently in a mutation carrier 's available family members. as controls, 300 unrelated, ethnically-matched healthy individuals were recruited, who were also genotyped for nkx2.5. the functional consequence of the mutant nkx2.5 was evaluated in contrast to its wild-type counterpart using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. as a result, a novel heterozygous nkx2.5 mutation, p.q181x, was identified in an index patient with asd and avb, with a prevalence of similar to 1.61%. genetic analysis of the proband 's pedigree revealed that the mutation co-segregated with asd and avb with complete penetrance. the nonsense mutation, which eliminated partial homeobox and the carboxyl terminus, was absent in the 600 control chromosomes. functional evaluation showed that the nkx2.5 mutant had no transcriptional activity. furthermore, the mutation disrupted the synergistic activation between nkx2.5 and gata binding protein 4, another cardiac core transcription factor associated with asd. the results of the present study expand the spectrum of nkx2.5 mutations linked to asd and avb, and indicated that nkx2.5 loss-of-function mutations are an uncommon cause of asd and avb in humans.
immunology	the pacific white shrimp litopenaeusvannamei is a euryhaline species with optimal salinity of 20-25 practical salinity unit (psu) for growth and survival, but has been cultured in inland water with salinity <5psu worldwide. in the past decade, much research progress has been made on the physiological and nutritional requirements of white shrimp at low salinity. this study reviews the recent findings in the aspects of growth, survival, energy metabolism, stress resistance and immunity of white shrimp at low salinity and synthesizes recent research outcomes in nutritional requirements in an attempt to improve the shrimp performance in aquaculture at low salinity. the white shrimp at low salinity usually show slow growth, low immunity, high susceptibility to pathogens and high energy demand. the diet containing 30-36% protein, 15-20% carbohydrate and supplementations of potassium, sodium, vitamin e and c, free amino acids (gly-cine, alanine, proline and taurine), antioxidants and probiotics can improve shrimp growth and immunity at low salinity. the white shrimp has demonstrated the ability to synthesize dha and epa from lna at low ambient salinity, but further studies are needed to further confirm this finding. future research should focus on the understanding of physiological mechanism and adaptation associated with salinity change and nutritional manipulation. the specific dietary requirements of essential fatty acids, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals and the nutrition-mediated immune response also warrant further study on shrimp at low salinity.
fluid_mechanics	3d-ptv is a quantitative flow measurement technique that aims to track the lagrangian paths of a set of particles in three dimensions using stereoscopic recording of image sequences. the basic components, features, constraints and optimization tips of a 3d-ptv topology consisting of a high-speed camera with a four-view splitter are described and discussed in this article. the technique is applied to the intermediate flow field (5 <x/d <25) of a circular jet at re approximate to 7,000. lagrangian flow features and turbulence quantities in an eulerian frame are estimated around ten diameters downstream of the jet origin and at various radial distances from the jet core. lagrangian properties include trajectory, velocity and acceleration of selected particles as well as curvature of the flow path, which are obtained from the frenet-serret equation. estimation of the 3d velocity and turbulence fields around the jet core axis at a cross-plane located at ten diameters downstream of the jet is compared with literature, and the power spectrum of the large-scale streamwise velocity motions is obtained at various radial distances from the jet core.
cell_biology	purpose of reviewcharcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt) is one of the commonest inherited neuromuscular diseases with a population prevalence of 1 in 2500. this review will cover recent advances in the genetics and pathomechanisms of cmt and how these are leading to the development of rational therapies.recent findingspathomechanistic and therapeutic target advances in cmt include the identification of the erbb receptor signalling pathway as a therapeutic target in cmt1a and pharmacological modification of the unfolded protein response in cmt1b. in cmt2d, due to mutations in glycyl-trna synthetase, vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated stimulation of the nrp1 receptor has been identified as a therapeutic target. preclinical advances have been accompanied by the publication of large natural history cohorts and the identification of a sensitive biomarker of disease (muscle mri) that is able to detect disease progression in cmt1a over 1 year.summaryadvances in next-generation sequencing technology, cell biology and animal models of cmt are paving the way for rational treatments. the combination of robust natural history data and the identification of sensitive biomarkers mean that we are now entering an exciting therapeutic era in the field of the genetic neuropathies.
molecular_biology	the pathways and mechanisms that regulate pulmonary surfactant synthesis, processing, secretion and catabolism have been extensively characterised using classical biochemical and analytical approaches. these have constructed a model, largely in experimental animals, for surfactant phospholipid metabolism in the alveolar epithelial cell whereby phospholipid synthesised on the endoplasmic reticulum is selectively transported to lamellar body storage vesicles, where it is subsequently processed before secretion into the alveolus. surfactant phospholipid is a complex mixture of individual molecular species defined by the combination of esterified fatty acid groups and a comprehensive description of surfactant phospholipid metabolism requires consideration of the interactions between such molecular species. however, until recently, lipid analytical techniques have not kept pace with the considerable advances in understanding of the enzymology and molecular biology of surfactant metabolism. refinements in electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (esi-ms) can now provide very sensitive platforms for the rapid characterisation of surfactant phospholipid composition in molecular detail. the combination of esi-ms and administration of phospholipid substrates labelled with stable isotopes extends this analytical approach to the quantification of synthesis and turnover of individual molecular species of surfactant phospholipid. as this methodology does not involve radioactivity, it is ideally suited to application in clinical studies. this review will provide an overview of the metabolic processes that regulate the molecular specificity of surfactant phosphatidylcholine together with examples of how the application of stable isotope technologies in vivo has, for the first time, begun to explore regulation of the molecular specificity of surfactant synthesis in human subjects.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: early diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) is an important issue to improve the prognosis. hox transcript antisense rna (hotair), a long noncoding rna (lncrna) expressed from the hoxc locus, has been recently revealed as an oncogenic regulator in escc. this study aimed to investigate whether serum hotair is involved in the diagnosis of escc. methods: in this study, we detected serum hotair expression in 50 patients with escc (including 42 tumor resection and 8 without surgery) and 20 healthy volunteers to investigate the role of serum hotair in escc using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) method. results: clinical data indicated that serum hotair were correlated with tnm stage. the expression level of serum hotair (0.189 +/- 0.010) was significantly higher in escc patients compared with that of healthy controls (0.055 +/- 0.008, p < 0.01). the roc curve analysis yielded an area under the roc curve (auc) value of 0.793 (95% ci: 0. 692 to 0.895, p < 0.01). also, the serum hotair expression level decreased obviously in postoperative samples (one month after the surgery) compared to preoperative specimens. moreover, there was a significant correlation between serum hotair expression and the expression of hotair in escc tissue according to pearson correlation analysis. conclusions: our study, for the first time, demonstrated that serum hotair might serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of escc.
cell_biology	background. glioblastomas (gbms) are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors. these tumors are resistant to therapeutic interventions and invariably recur after surgical resection. the multifunctional protein transglutaminase 2 (tg2) has been shown to promote cell survival in a number of different tumors. there is also evidence that tg2 may be a pro-survival factor in gbms. however, the roles that tg2 plays in facilitating gbm survival and proliferation have not yet been clearly delineated. methods. the functions of tg2 are often cell-and context-specific. therefore, in this study we examined the ability of tg2 to facilitate gbm proliferation using colony formation assays and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (edu) incorporation in several different gbm cell lines as well as neurospheres derived from patient tumors representing the 3 major subtypes of gbm tumors (mesenchymal, proneural, and classical) and maintained in the absence of serum. tg2 knockdown or selective tg2 inhibitors were used to modulate tg2 expression and activity. results. we show that tg2 plays differential roles in the proliferative process depending on the cell type. in most, but not all, gbm models tg2 plays a crucial role in the proliferative process, and some but not all tg2 inhibitors were highly effective at reducing proliferation in a large subset of the gbm models. conclusion. our results show that tg2 plays an important-but notoriously context-specific-role in gbm cell biology. nonetheless, as future studies unravel the genetic "" fingerprints"" that make tg2 inhibitors effective, this information could be exploited to develop tg2 inhibitors into personalized gbm therapies.
molecular_biology	his-asn-his (hnh) proteins are a very common family of small nucleic acid-binding proteins that are generally associated with endonuclease activity and are found in all kingdoms of life. although hnh endonucleases from mesophiles have been widely investigated, the biochemical functions of hnh endonucleases from thermophilic bacteriophages remain unknown. here, we characterized the biochemical properties of a thermostable hnh endonuclease from deep-sea thermophilic bacteriophage gve2. the recombinant gve2 hnh endonuclease exhibited non-specific cleavage activity at high temperature. the optimal temperature of the gve2 hnh endonuclease for cleaving dna was 60-65 a degrees c, and the enzyme retained its dna cleavage activity even after heating at 100 a degrees c for 30 min, suggesting the enzyme is a thermostable endonuclease. the gve2 hnh endonuclease cleaved dna over a wide ph spectrum, ranging from 5.5 to 9.0, and the optimal ph for the enzyme activity was 8.0-9.0. furthermore, the gve2 hnh endonuclease activity was dependent on a divalent metal ion. while the enzyme is inactive in the presence of cu2+, the gve2 hnh endonuclease displayed cleavage activity of varied efficiency with mn2+, mg2+, ca2+, fe2+, co2+, zn2+, and ni2+. the gve2 hnh endonuclease activity was inhibited by nacl. this study provides the basis for determining the role of this endonuclease in life cycle of the bacteriophage gve2 and suggests the potential application of the enzyme in molecular biology and biotechnology.
cell_biology	goblet cells within the conjunctival epithelium are specialized cells that secrete mucins onto the surface of the eye. recent research has demonstrated new characteristics of the cells, including factors influencing their differentiation, their gene products and their functions at the ocular surface. the following review summarizes the newly discovered aspects of the role of spdef, a member of the ets transcription factor family in conjunctival goblet cell differentiation, the newly discovered goblet cell products including claudin2, the wnt inhibitor frzb, and the transmembrane mucin muc16. the current concepts of conjunctival goblet cell function, including debris removal and immune surveillance are reviewed, as are changes in the goblet cell population in ocular surface diseases. major remaining questions regarding conjunctival cell biology are discussed.

molecular_biology	geometric and electrostatic modeling is an essential component in computational biophysics and molecular biology. commonly used geometric representations admit geometric singularities such as cusps, tips and self-intersecting facets that lead to computational instabilities in the molecular modeling. the present work explores the use of flexibility and rigidity index (fri), which has a proved superiority in protein b-factor prediction, for biomolecular geometric representation and associated electrostatic analysis. fri rigidity surfaces are free of geometric singularities. we proposed a rigidity based poisson -boltzmann equation for biomolecular electrostatic analysis. our approaches to surface and electrostatic modeling are validated by a set of 21 proteins. our results are compared with those of established methods. finally, being smooth and analytically differentiable, fri rigidity functions offer excellent curvature analysis, which characterizes concave and convex regions on protein surfaces. polarized curvatures constructed by using the product of minimum curvature and electrostatic potential is shown to predict potential protein-ligand binding sites.

cell_biology	mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase1 (gdh1) (e.c. 1.4.1.3) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia while reducing nad+ and/or nadp+ to nadh and/or nadph. it links amino acid with carbohydrate metabolism, contributing to krebs cycle anaplerosis, energy production, ammonia handling and redox homeostasis. although gdh1 was one of the first major metabolic enzymes to be studied decades ago, its role in cell biology is still incompletely understood. there is however growing interest in a novel gdh2 isoenzyme that emerged via duplication in primates and underwent rapid evolutionary selection concomitant with prefrontal human cortex expansion. also, the anaplerotic function of gdh1 and gdh2 is currently under sharp focus as this relates to the biology of glial tumors and other neoplasias. here we used antibodies specific for human gdh1 (hgdh1) and human gdh2 (hgdh2) to study the expression of these isoenzymes in human tissues. results revealed that both hgdh1 and hgdh2 are expressed in human brain, kidney, testis and steroidogenic organs. however, distinct hgdh1 and hgdh2 expression patterns emerged. thus, while the sertoli cells of human testis were strongly positive for hgdh2, they were negative for hgdh1. conversely, hgdh1 showed very high levels of expression in human liver, but hepatocytes were virtually devoid of hgdh2. in human adrenals, both hgdhs were densely expressed in steroid-producing cells, with hgdh2 expression pattern matching that of the cholesterol side chain cleavage system involved in steroid synthesis. similarly in human ovaries and placenta, both hgdh1 and hgdh2 were densely expressed in estrogen producing cells. in addition, hgdh1, being a housekeeping enzyme, was also expressed in cells that lack endocrine function. regarding human brain, study of cortical sections using immunofluorescence (if) with confocal microscopy revealed that hgdh1 and hgdh2 were both expressed in the cytoplasm of gray and white matter astrocytes within coarse structures resembling mitochondria. additionally, hgdh1 localized to the nuclear membrane of a subpopulation of astrocytes and of the vast majority of oligodendrocytes and their precursors. remarkably, hgdh2-specific staining was detected in human cortical neurons, with different expression patterns having emerged. one pattern, observed in large cortical neurons (some with pyramidal morphology), was a hgdh2-specific labeling of cytoplasmic structures resembling mitochondria. these were distributed either in the cell body-axon or on the cell surface in close proximity to astrocytic end-feet that encircle glutamatergic synapses. another pattern was observed in small cortical neurons with round dense nuclei in which the hgdh2-specific staining was found in the nuclear membrane. a detailed description of these observations and their functional implications, suggesting that the gdh flux is used by different cells to serve some of their unique functions, is presented below.
thermodynamics	a physical model is proposed to enable a unified thermodynamic treatment of the vacancy-bearing solid and the gas. it also solves the long-standing controversy in modeling the vacancies in solids within the calphad approach. the model parameters are related to quantities that can be calculated by first-principles or measured experimentally. the vapor pressure of tungsten is calculated using the proposed model and methods, achieving satisfactory agreement with experimental data. it is pointed out that the site fraction is an order parameter in the present model that can be used to describe sublimation.

internal_combustion_engine	this report analyzes the health benefits associated with driving an electric vehicle, and compares them with the cost of expanding the electric vehicle charging infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. damages related to poor air quality such as sick days and increased chronic illness were quantified, and reductions in instances of these issues resulted in a benefit that can be reaped by governments and municipalities. the results indicate that the benefits associated with improved air quality in general exceed the costs of installing additional charging stations. the findings indicate that the overall outlook for future expansion of charging stations can be borne by the improved air quality provided by an increasing movement away from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electrified mobility options.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose. the impact of an antimicrobial stewardship initiative on time to first antibiotic dose and clinical outcomes in bacteremic patients was, evaluated. methods. a single-center, retrospective study was conducted for adult inpatients who received antibiotics before and after implementation of a rapid administration of antimicrobials by an infectious diseases specialist (raids) protocol. patients admitted to an inpatient service from june to october 2011 (pre-raids protocol) and from december 2011 to february 2012 (post-raids protocol) were eligible for inclusion if (1) they were age 18 years or older, (2) their infection occurred two or more days after hospital admission, and (3) they had a blood culture growing an organism other than common skin contaminants (i.e., coagulase-negative staphylococci, bacillus species). the primary outcome was the time to the first antibiotic dose (tfad), defined as the time that elapsed from a positive blood culture result to administration of the first empirical antimicrobial dose. results. a total of 111 bacteremic patients were included in the analysis. implementation of the raids protocol led to significantly faster antibiotic order entry, verification, and administration of empirical antibiotics in patients with bacteremia. the median tfad was approximately 8 hours faster in the post-raids group than in the pre-raids group (9:09 hr:min versus 1:23 hr:min, p < 0.001). patients in the post-raids group had a significant reduction in infection-related mortality (p = 0.047), though all cause 30-day mortality was similar. conclusion. early notification of an infectious diseases pharmacist about positive blood cultures using the raids protocol led to increased appropriateness of empirical drug selection and a dramatic reduction in the administration of antibiotics and was associated with decreased infection related mortality.
fluid_mechanics	in pre-surgery decisions in hospital emergency cases, fast and reliable results of the solid and fluid mechanics problems are of great interest to clinicians. in the current investigation, an iterative process based on a pressure-type boundary condition is proposed in order to reduce the computational costs of blood flow simulations in arteries, without losing control of the important clinical parameters. the incorporation of cardiovascular autoregulation, together with the well-known impedance boundary condition, forms the basis of the proposed methodology. with autoregulation, the instabilities associated with conventional pressure-type or impedance boundary conditions are avoided without an excessive increase in computational costs. the general behaviour of pulsatile blood flow in arteries, which is important from the clinical point of view, is well reproduced through this new methodology. in addition, the interaction between the blood and the arterial walls occurs via a modified weak coupling, which makes the simulation more stable and computationally efficient. based on in vitro experiments, the hyperelastic behaviour of the wall is characterised and modelled. the applications and benefits of the proposed pressure-type boundary condition are shown in a model of an idealised aortic arch with and without an ascending aorta dissection, which is a common cardiovascular disorder.
immunology	introduction: regulatory t cells (treg) play an important role in suppressing anti- immunity and their depletion has been linked to improved outcomes. to better understand the role of treg in limiting the efficacy of anti-cancer immunity, we used a diphtheria toxin (dtx) transgenic mouse model to specifically target and deplete treg. methods: tumor bearing balb/c foxp3.dtr transgenic mice were subjected to different treatment protocols, with or without treg depletion and tumor growth and survival monitored. results: dtx specifically depleted treg in a transient, dose-dependent manner. treg depletion correlated with delayed tumor growth, increased effector t cell (teff) activation, and enhanced survival in a range of solid tumors. tumor regression was dependent on teffs as depletion of both cd4 and cd8 t cells completely abrogated any survival benefit. severe morbidity following treg depletion was only observed, when consecutive doses of dtx were given during peak cd8 t cell activation, demonstrating that treg can be depleted on multiple occasions, but only when cd8 t cell activation has returned to base line levels. finally, we show that even minimal treg depletion is sufficient to significantly improve the efficacy of tumor-peptide vaccination. conclusions: balb/c.foxp3.dtr mice are an ideal model to investigate the full therapeutic potential of treg depletion to boost anti-tumor immunity. dtx-mediated treg depletion is transient, dose-dependent, and leads to strong anti-tumor immunity and complete tumor regression at high doses, while enhancing the efficacy of tumor-specific vaccination at low doses. together this data highlight the importance of treg manipulation as a useful strategy for enhancing current and future cancer immunotherapies.
genetics	background: drug-induced qt interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. the contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline qt interval to drug-induced qt prolongation and arrhythmias is not known. methods: we tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to qt interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple qt-prolonging drugs. genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 qt-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched qt and plasma drug concentration measurements. subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. the outcome was the correlation between a genetic qt score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject 's drug-induced increase in heart rate-corrected qt (qtc) versus drug concentration. results: the genetic qt score was correlated with drug-induced qtc prolongation. among white subjects, genetic qt score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (r=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.81; p=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (r=0.48; 95% confidence interval, -0.03 to 0.79; p=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (r=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.80; p=0.03). furthermore, the genetic qt score was a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (r(2)=12%, p=1x10(-7)). conclusions: we demonstrate that a genetic qt score comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced qt prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes. these findings highlight an opportunity for recent genetic discoveries to improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for pharmacological therapies. replication of these findings in larger samples is needed to more precisely estimate variance explained and to establish the individual variants that drive these effects.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper presents a fully coupled multiphysics model developed for numerical simulation of the elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact between a cam and roller, typically found in cam mechanisms controlling fuel injection in an internal combustion engine. special attention was focused on enabling systematic analyses of effects associated with, roller crowning and edge geometries, lubricant rheology as well as typical cam mechanism operating conditions. the interaction between the cam and roller follower result in high generated pressure and narrow film thickness that increase the risk of wear and fatigue. furthermore, this article highlights the variation of pressure and film thickness under tilting conditions. the model was also validated against some particular model problems, found in the literature.

computer-aided_design	an optimization technique that utilizes a genetic algorithm is used to minimize the electrical power produced by the conducting disks in resistive bitter magnets. the resulting values from the optimization give the conditional design parameters necessary for a preliminary magnet design. this precursor design method can be employed for either split or single solenoid nested designs. this method is used to design a 10 t, 10 s magnet at the university of maryland, baltimore county for plasma physics research. the design parameters from the optimization are used to generate computer-aided design models that are examined with finite element analysis software to verify safety and performance of the design. the magnet design then progresses to a series of thermal and mechanical tests to ensure safe operating conditions.
human_metabolism	predictions of human pesticide metabolism which are needed for the interpretation of biological monitoring data are frequently made from animal studies. consequently, assumptions have to be made about the relationship between absorbed dose and metabolite excretion. the results from two human volunteer studies highlight the problems associated with extrapolating from animal studies in this way. the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin shows markedly different metabolite patterns when administered orally or dermally in man. following dermal dosing the ratio of trans/cis cyclopropane acids is approximately 1:1, compared to 2:1 after oral administration. the ratio of total cyclopropane acids to phenoxybenzoic acids also differs depending on the route (dermal 1:4, oral 1:0.8). a knowledge of human metabolism by these two routes enables a much more meaningful interpretation of biological monitoring measurements. the herbicide molinate forms a mercapturate conjugate as a major urinary metabolite in the rat (35%). in volunteers at low dose levels this metabolite is present at insignificant levels (< 1%) and 4-hydroxymolinatc is a much more abundant metabolite (39%). this shows that extrapolation between species can be very misleading. it is concluded that the benefits of using human volunteers for metabolism studies at low doses far outweigh the minimal risks involved. as a basis for biological monitoring such studies can lead to a greatly improved risk assessment for pesticides in use.
northern_blotting	background. lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) is a lipid mediator with multiple biological activities that may affect the progression of various cancers. malignant ascites contains high levels of lpa as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf). although lpa receptors are widely expressed in normal as well as cancer cells, little is known about the effect of lpa on host cells. therefore, we evaluated the effect of lpa specifically on peritoneal mesothelial cells (pmc), and assessed another aspect of lpa in tumor biology mediated through the host cells. materials and methods. the effect of lpa on the production of vegf was evaluated by elisa and northern blotting. next, we quantified human- and mouse-vegf separately in ascitic fluid of nude mice inoculated intraperitoneally with a human gastric cancer, mkn45, and thus evaluated the ratio of host-derived vegf in malignant ascites. results. addition of 10 to 80 mu m lpa enhanced vegf production by pmc through gene activation. the effect was strongly inhibited by pre-treatment with ptx or ki16425, indicating that the effect was mainly dependent on the lpa1 signal. of the vegf in ascitic fluid at 3 weeks after tumor inoculation, 12.8% was derived from mouse cells. at 6 weeks, however, the ratio of host-derived vegf was reduced to 5.0%, suggesting that the ratio of host-derived vegf may be higher in the earlier phase. conclusion. because tumor growth is often associated with an increase of lpa concentration in ascites, stimulation of vegf production in pmc might have an important role in the growth of cancer cells disseminated in the peritoneal cavity.

hydraulics	restoration of channelized streams by returning coarse sediment from stream edges to the wetted channel has become a common practice in sweden. yet, restoration activities do not always result in the return of desired biota. this study evaluated a restoration project in the vindel river in northern sweden in which practitioners further increased channel complexity of previously restored stream reaches by placing very large boulders (>1 m), trees (>8 m), and salmonid spawning gravel from adjacent upland areas into the channels. one reach restored with basic methods and another with enhanced methods were selected in each of ten different tributaries to the main channel. geomorphic and hydraulic complexity was enhanced but the chemical composition of riparian soils and the communities of riparian plants and fish did not exhibit any clear responses to the enhanced restoration measures during the first 5 years compared to reaches restored with basic restoration methods. the variation in the collected data was among streams instead of between types of restored reaches. we conclude that restoration is a disturbance in itself, that immigration potential varies across landscapes, and that biotic recovery processes in boreal river systems are slow. we suggest that enhanced restoration has to apply a catchment-scale approach accounting for connectivity and availability of source populations, and that low-intensity monitoring has to be performed over several decades to evaluate restoration outcomes.
enzymology	background knowing the physiological ranges of certain hematological and biochemical parameters is necessary for understanding the alterations caused by pathogenic agents and establishing differences between states of health and disease. hematological evaluations and clinical chemistry were performed on livers and kidneys from owl monkeys with different sexes and age ranges. methods forty-one healthy owl monkeys were evaluated (26 males and 15 females) in three different age groups (ag1 = 3 months to 1 year old; ag2 = 2-6 years old; ag3 = over 7 years old). the animals received physical exams, abdominal ultrasounds, and clinical laboratory tests. results and conclusions significant differences were observed in hematocrit and hemoglobin values between males and females. the levels of alkaline phosphatase in the tissues were significantly influenced by age. there was also a sex influence on blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. the results show that some hematological and clinical chemistry parameters in owl monkeys may be influenced by sex and age.
enzymology	1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (dxp) synthase catalyzes the formation of dxp from pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (grap) in a thiamin diphosphate-dependent manner, and is the first step in the essential pathway to isoprenoids in human pathogens. understanding the mechanism of this unique enzyme is critical for developing new anti-infective agents that selectively target isoprenoid biosynthesis. the present study used mutagenesis and a combination of protein fluorescence, cd and kinetics experiments to investigate the roles of arg420, arg478 and tyr392 in substrate binding and catalysis. the results support a random sequential, preferred order mechanism, and predict that arg420 and arg478 are involved in binding of the acceptor substrate, grap. d-glyceraldehyde, an alternative acceptor substrate lacking the phosphoryl group predicted to interact with arg420 and arg478, also accelerates decarboxylation of the predecarboxylation intermediate c2 alpha-lactylthiamin diphosphate (lthdp) on dxp synthase, indicating that this binding interaction is not absolutely required, and that the hydroxyaldehyde sufficiently triggers decarboxylation. unexpectedly, tyr392 contributes to grap affinity, and is not required for lthdp formation or its grap-promoted decarboxylation. time-resolved cd spectroscopy and nmr experiments indicate that lthdp is significantly stabilized on r420a and y392f variants as compared with wild-type dxp synthase in the absence of acceptor substrate, but these substitutions do not appear to affect the rate of grap-promoted lthdp decarboxylation in the presence of high levels of grap, and lthdp formation remains the rate-limiting step. these results suggest a role of these residues in promoting grap binding, which in turn facilitates decarboxylation, and also highlight interesting differences between dxp synthase and other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes.
computer-aided_design	dealing with component interactions and dependencies remains a core and fundamental aspect of engineering, where conflicts and constraints are solved on an almost daily basis. failure to consider these interactions and dependencies can lead to costly overruns, failure to meet requirements, and lengthy redesigns. thus, the management and monitoring of these dependencies remains a crucial activity in engineering projects and is becoming ever more challenging with the increase in the number of components, component interactions, and component dependencies, in both a structural and a functional sense. for these reasons, tools and methods to support the identification and monitoring of component interactions and dependencies continues to be an active area of research. in particular, design structure matrices (dsms) have been extensively applied to identify and visualize product and organizational architectures across a number of engineering disciplines. however, the process of generating these dsms has primarily used surveys, structured interviews, and/or meetings with engineers. as a consequence, there is a high cost associated with engineers' time alongside the requirement to continually update the dsm structure as a product develops. it follows that the proposition of this paper is to investigate whether an automated and continuously evolving dsm can be generated by monitoring the changes in the digital models that represent the product. this includes models that are generated from computer-aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics systems. the paper shows that a dsm generated from the changes in the product models corroborates with the product architecture as defined by the engineers and results from previous dsm studies. in addition, further levels of product architecture dependency were also identified. a particular affordance of automatically generating dsms is the ability to continually generate dsms throughout the project. this paper demonstrates the opportunity for project managers to monitor emerging product dependencies alongside changes in modes of working between the engineers. the application of this technique could be used to support existing product life cycle change management solutions, cross-company product development, and small to medium enterprises who do not have a product life cycle management solution.
internal_combustion_engine	the growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, together with increasingly available parallelism provided by multi-core chips, fosters the parallelization of simulation. simulation speed-ups are expected from co-simulation and parallelization based on model splitting into weakly coupled submodels, such as in the framework of a functional mockup interface. however, slackened synchronization between submodels and their associated solvers running in parallel introduces integration errors, which must be kept inside acceptable bounds. choptrey denotes a forecasting framework enhancing the performance of complex system co-simulation, with a trivalent articulation. first, we consider the framework of a computationally hasty online prediction system. it allows to improve the tradeoff between integration speed-ups, needing large communication steps, and simulation precision, needing frequent updates for model inputs. second, smoothed adaptive forward prediction improves co-simulation accuracy. it is obtained by past-weighted extrapolation based on causal hopping oblivious polynomials. third, signal behavior is segmented to handle the discontinuities of the exchanged signals: the segmentation is performed in a contextual and hierarchical ontology of patterns. implementation strategies and simulation results demonstrate the framework ability to adaptively relax data communication constraints beyond synchronization points which sensibly accelerate the simulation. the choptrey framework extends the range of applications of standard waring-lagrange polynomial extrapolation, often deemed unstable. the embedding of predictions in lag-dependent smoothing and discontinuity handling demonstrates its practical efficiency.
northern_blotting	the virion host shutoff protein (vhs), encoded by the gene ul41, has rnase activity and is the key regulator of the early host shutoff response induced by type 1 herpes simplex virus. despite low amino acid similarity, the vhs protein of the swine herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (prv), also exhibits rnase activity. however, the mechanism underlying the action of vhs remains undefined. here, we report that the rna degradation profile of prv vhs is similar, but not identical, to that of type 1 herpes simplex virus vhs. notably, the presence of a cap structure enhances both the degradation rate and the preferential targeting of the vhs protein towards the 3-end of the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (ires). furthermore, type 1 herpes simplex virus vhs produces a simple degradation pattern, but prv vhs gives rise to multiple intermediates. the results of northern blotting using probes recognizing various regions of the rna substrate found that prv vhs also cleaves downstream of the ires region and this vhs protein overall shows 5 to 3 rnase activity. moreover, addition of the translation initiation factors eif4h and eif4b significantly increased the rnase activity of recombinant prv vhs against capped rna. nonetheless, these proteins did not fully reconstitute the ires-directed targeting pattern observed for vhs translated in a rabbit reticular lysate system. the interaction between prv vhs and eif4h/eif4b implies that the translation initiation machinery within the cell is able to stimulate the nuclease activity of prv vhs. however, this process remains inefficient in terms of the ires-targeting pattern.
cell_biology	endocytosis is a key process in the internalization of extracellular materials and plasma membrane proteins, such as receptors and transporters, thereby controlling many aspects of cell signaling and cellular homeostasis. endocytosis in plants has an essential role not only for basic cellular functions but also for growth and development, nutrient delivery, toxin avoidance, and pathogen defense. the precise mechanisms of endocytosis in plants remain quite elusive. the lack of direct visualization and examination of single events of endocytosis has greatly hampered our ability to precisely monitor the cell surface lifetime and the recruitment profile of proteins driving endocytosis or endocytosed cargos in plants. here, we discuss the necessity to systematically implement total internal reflection fluorescence microcopy (tirf) in the plant cell biology community and present reliable protocols for high spatial and temporal imaging of endocytosis in plants using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a test case, since it represents the major route for internalization of cell-surface proteins in plants. we developed a robust method to directly visualize cell surface proteins using tirf microscopy combined to a high throughput, automated and unbiased analysis pipeline to determine the temporal recruitment profile of proteins to single sites of endocytosis, using the departure of clathrin as a physiological reference for scission. using this 'departure assay', we assessed the recruitment of two different ap-2 subunits, alpha and mu, to the sites of endocytosis and found that ap2a1 was recruited in concert with clathrin, while ap2m was not. this validated approach therefore offers a powerful solution to better characterize the plant endocytic machinery and the dynamics of one 's favorite cargo protein.
immunology	introduction: tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) gene -308g/a polymorphism (rs1800629) are associated with psoriasis in several populations worldwide. presently, there is no literature on the status of this polymorphism in the south indian population. aim: to determine the profile of tnf alpha -308g/a polymorphism among psoriatic patients. materials and methods: this case-control study involved 74 patients with psoriasis vulgaris (psv) and 74 age and gender matched healthy individuals. patients were recruited from the department of dermatology of r. l. jalappa hospital and research center, tamaka, kolar, karnataka, india, from march 2014 to march 2016. tnf alpha -308g/a polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) method. results: the frequency of tnf alpha -308a allele 7.4% among psoriatic and 8.8% among non-psoriatic individuals. the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.82). conclusion: our results indicate that tnf alpha gene -308g/a polymorphism is not a significant marker for the risk of developing psv among south indian (karnataka) psoriatic patients.
manufacturing_engineering	this paper presents the methodology that is being applied at present time for teaching and evaluation of different courses in the area of manufacturing processes engineering at the university of leon. the context is delimited to the use of content management systems and continuous evaluation of learning. in particular, the moodle platform is used for structuring the contents and for the continuous evaluation of courses in the scope of materials science, manufacturing processes and automation of operations. an analysis of the changes and challenges derived from the adoption of this methodology in the different courses in which has been applied is presented. these changes have been slightly different as a function of the compulsory or optional character of courses, as well as depending on the number of students enrolled in them.
molecular_biology	aim: little is known about molecular biology of brain metastasis (bm) from colorectal cancer and its concordance with matched primary tumors. materials & methods: we identified 56 consecutive colorectal cancer patients who underwent neurosurgical resection of bm. tumor samples were tested for kras, nras, braf and pik3ca. the molecular profile of the brain lesion was compared with the corresponding primary tumor. results: the molecular profile concordance rate was 95.1%. median survival after neurosurgery was 5.5 months (95% ci: 4.7-6.3); median overall survival was 24.0 months (95% ci: 15.6-32.4). conclusion: in this cohort, we report a high frequency of kras mutations and a very high concordance rate between the molecular status of bm and that of matched primary tumors.
southern_blotting	telomere length analysis has been greatly simplified by the quantitative flow cytometry technique fish-flow. in this method, a fluorescein-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the telomere terminal repeat sequence is hybridized to the telomere sequence and the resulting fluorescence measured by flow cytometry. this technique has supplanted the traditional laborious southern blot telomere length measurement techniques in many laboratories, and allows single cell analysis of telomere length in high-throughput sample formats. nevertheless, the harsh conditions required for telomere probe annealing (82 degrees c) has made it difficult to successfully combine this technique with simultaneous immunolabeling. most traditional organic fluorescent probes (i.e. fluorescein, phycoerythrin, etc.) have limited thermal stability and do not survive the high temperature annealing process, despite efforts to covalently crosslink the antigen-antibody-fluorophore complex. this loss of probe fluorescence has made it difficult to measure fish-flow in complex lymphocyte populations, and has generally forced investigators to use fluorescent-activated cell sorting to pre-separate their populations, a laborious technique that requires prohibitively large numbers of cells. in this study, we have substituted quantum dots (nanoparticles) for traditional fluorophores in fish-flow. quantum dots were demonstrated to possess much greater thermal stability than traditional low molecular weight and phycobiliprotein fluorophores. quantum dot antibody conjugates directed against monocyte and t cell antigens were found to retain most of their fluorescence following the high temperature annealing step, allowing simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement. since quantum dots have very narrow emission bandwidths, we were able to analyze multiple quantum dot antibody conjugates (qdot 605, 655 and 705) simultaneously with fish-flow measurement to assess the age-associated decline in telomere length in both human monocytes and t cell subsets. with quantum dot immunolabeling, the mean decrease rate in telomere length for cd4+ cells was calculated at 41.8 bp/year, very close to previously reported values using traditional flow-fish and southern blotting. this modification to the traditional flow-fish technique should therefore allow simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement, permitting complex cell subset-specific analysis in small numbers of cells without the requirement for prior cell sorting. published by elsevier b.v.
northern_blotting	the present study was designed to compare the expression pattern of dlx3 in four different mineralized tissues because of: 1-its role in skeleton patterning, 2-its expression in dental epithelium and mesenchyme during morphogenesis, 3-the membranous and endochondral bone and tooth phenotype of tricho-dento-osseous syndrome related to dlx3 gene mutation and 4-recently emerging knowledge on dlx family members in the bone field. ameloblasts, odontoblasts, osteoblasts and chondrocytes were analyzed ill vitro and in vivo. dlx3 transcripts were detected by rt-pcr in established model systems (microdissected dental epithelium and mesenchyme; primary cultures of rat chondrocytes), as recently performed in osteoblasts in vitro. a human 414-bp dlx3 probe was generated. a 4.5-kb human dlx3 sense rna was identified in maxillo-facial samples by northern blotting. immunolabeling and in situ hybridization were performed in mice from theiler stage e 14.5 until birth. in teeth, although dlx3 was still expressed in differentiated ameloblasts, it was down regulated during odontoblast polarization. during endochondral bone formation, dlx3 protein was detected in chondrocytes and was most strongly expressed in the prehypertrophic cartilage zone and in differentiating and differentiated osteoblasts of inetaphyseal periosteum. in vitro, real-time pcr studies supported this upregulation in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, closely correlated with ihh variations. in membranous bone, dlx3 was present in preosteoblasts, osteoblasts and osteoid-osteocytes. the present data on dlx3 and recently published functional studies show that this transcription factor may be instrumental during growth in the control of matrix deposition and biomineralization in the entire skeleton.

genetics	heritable predisposition is an important cause of cancer in children and adolescents. although a large number of cancer predisposition genes and their associated syndromes and malignancies have already been described, it appears likely that there are more pediatric cancer patients in whom heritable cancer predisposition syndromes have yet to be recognized. in a consensus meeting in the beginning of 2016, we convened experts in human genetics and pediatric hematology/oncology to review the available data, to categorize the large amount of information, and to develop recommendations regarding when a cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected in a young oncology patient. this review summarizes the current knowledge of cancer predisposition syndromes in pediatric oncology and provides essential information on clinical situations in which a childhood cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected.
human_metabolism	simple voltammetric determination of thiodiglycolic acid (tdga) offers the possibility to follow individual deviations in metabolism of thiocompounds and one-carbon (1c) and two-carbon (2c) units, which take part in endogenous synthesis of creatine (cr). in three groups of young men the levels of tdga in urine were followed after application of cr given as food supplement in 5 g daily doses. in the first group (7 men) it was found that the level of tdga increased independently of the day time of application of cr. in the second group (9 men) the level of tdga increased within an interval of 3-8.5 h after cr application and then dropped during 2 h to the normal level (20 mg l-1). in the third group (11 men), in 4 days' study the effects of cr were compared in alternation to vitamin b-12. vitamin b-12 was given in the evening of the 1st and 3rd day and cr in the morning of the 3rd and 4th day. cr increased the excretion of tdga in all men, while b-12 only in four men independently of cr application.

enzymology	the camp-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase a, pm-a) plays a key role in the control of eukaryotic cellular activity. the enzymology of pk-a in the free-living nematode, caenorhabditis elegans is deceptively simple. single genes encode the catalytic (c) subunit (kin-1), the regulatory (r) subunit (kin-2) and an a-kinase anchor protein (akap) (aka-1); nonetheless, pk-a is able to facilitate a comprehensive array of camp-mediated processes in this model multicellular organism. we have previously demonstrated that, in c. elegans, as many as 12 different isoforms of the c-subunit arise as a consequence of alternative splicing strategies. here, we report the occurrence of transcripts encoding novel isoforms of the pm-a r-subunit in c. elegans. in place of exons 1 and 2, these transcripts include coding sequences from novel b or q exons directly linked to exon 3, thereby generating isoforms with novel n-termini. r-subunits containing an exon b-encoded n-terminal polypeptide sequence were detected in extracts prepared from mixed populations of c elegans. of note is the observation that r-subunit isoforms containing exon b- or exon q-encoded polypeptide sequences lack the dimerisation/docking domains conventionally seen in r-subunits. this means that they are unlikely to participate in the formation of tetrameric pm-a holoenzymes and, additionally, they are unlikely to interact with akap(s). it is therefore possible that, in c. elegans, in addition to tetrameric (r2c2) pm-a holoenzymes, there is also a sub-population of dimeric (rc) pm-a enzymes that are not tethered by akaps. furthermore, inspection of the n-terminal sequence encoded by exon b suggests that this isoform is a likely target for n-myristoylation. although unusual, a number of similarly n-myristoylatable r-subunits, from a range of different species, are present in the databases, suggesting that this may be a more generally observed feature of r-subunit structure. the occurrence of r-subunit isoforms, without dimerisation/docking domains (with or without n-myristoylatable n-termini) in other species would suggest that the control of pm-a activity may be more complex than hitherto thought.

materials_engineering	a bottom-up, multiscale modeling approach is presented to carry out high-fidelity virtual mechanical tests of composite materials and structures. the strategy begins with the in situ measurement of the matrix and interface mechanical properties at the nanometer-micrometer range to build up a ladder of the numerical simulations, which take into account the relevant deformation and failure mechanisms at different length scales relevant to individual plies, laminates and components. the main features of each simulation step and the information transferred between length scales are described in detail as well as the current limitations and the areas for further development. finally, the roadmap for the extension of the current strategy to include functional properties and processing into the simulation scheme is delineated.
molecular_biology	background hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein, in addition to its structural role to form the nucleocapsid assembly, plays a critical role in hcv pathogenesis by interfering in several cellular processes, including microrna and mrna homeostasis. the c-terminal truncated hcv core protein (c124) is intrinsically unstructured in solution and is able to interact with unspecific nucleic acids, in the micromolar range, and to assemble into nucleocapsid-like particles (nlps) in vitro. the specificity and propensity of c124 to the assembly and its implications on hcv pathogenesis are not well understood. methods spectroscopic techniques, transmission electron microscopy and calorimetry were used to better understand the propensity of c124 to fold or to multimerize into nlps when subjected to different conditions or in the presence of unspecific nucleic acids of equivalent size to cellular micrornas. results the structural analysis indicated that c124 has low propensity to self-folding. on the other hand, for the first time, we show that c124, in the absence of nucleic acids, multimerizes into empty nlps when subjected to a ph close to its isoelectric point (ph ? 12), indicating that assembly is mainly driven by charge neutralization. isothermal calorimetry data showed that the assembly of nlps promoted by nucleic acids is enthalpy driven. additionally, data obtained from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy show that c124, in nanomolar range, was able to interact and to sequester a large number of short unspecific nucleic acids into nlps. discussion together, our data showed that the charge neutralization is the major factor for the nucleocapsid-like particles assembly from c-terminal truncated hcv core protein. this finding suggests that hcv core protein may physically interact with unspecific cellular polyanions, which may correspond to micrornas and mrnas in a host cell infected by hcv, triggering their confinement into infectious particles.
molecular_biology	current treatments for acute or degenerative chondral and osteochondral lesions are in need of improvement, as these types of injuries lead to disability and worsen the quality of life in a high percentage of patients. the aim of this study was to develop a new bi-layered scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration through a ""biomimetic"" and ""bioinspired"" approach. for chondral regeneration, the scaffold was realized with an organic compound (type i collagen), while for the regeneration of the subchondral layer, bioactive magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (mg/ha) crystals were co-precipitated with the organic component of the scaffold. the entire scaffold structure was stabilized with a cross-linking agent, highly reactive bis-epoxyde (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether - bddge 1 wt%). the developed scaffold was then characterized for its physico-chemical characteristics. its structure and adhesion strength between the integrated layers were investigated. at the same time, in vitro cell culture studies were carried out to examine the ability of chondral and bone scaffold layers to separately support adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. moreover, an in vivo study with nude mice, transplanted with osteochondral scaffolds plain or engineered with undifferentiated hmscs, was also set up with 4 and 8-week time points. the results showed that chondral and bone scaffold layers represented biocompatible scaffolds able to sustain hmscs attachment and proliferation. moreover, the association of scaffold stimuli and differentiation medium, induced hmscs chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ecm). the ectopic implantation of the engineered osteochondral scaffolds indicated that hmscs were able to colonize the osteochondral scaffold in depth. the scaffold appeared permissive to tissue growth and penetration, ensuring the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, as also suggested by the presence of a neo-angiogenesis process, especially at 4 weeks. moreover, the in vivo results further confirmed the great potential of the scaffold in tissue engineering, as it was able to support the initial formation of new bone and chondral tissue, confirming the importance of combined and innovative strategies to improve the available therapeutic strategies for chondral and osteochondral regeneration.

manufacturing_engineering	recent interest in improving pedagogical approaches in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields has stimulated research at many universities. several educational methodologies are reviewed in the context of manufacturing and through the lens of sustainability. it is found that there is a need to identify and understand the stem educational challenges, and to assess the usefulness of existing methodologies using case-based analyses. in particular, this research aims to support student learning in manufacturing engineering through real-time process evaluations. a pedagogical framework is presented that can assist engineering educators in developing learning modules in support of this goal. the framework encompasses four steps: define the learning outcomes, create instructional resources, create active learning resources, and create a summative assessment mechanism. the framework emphasizes engagement of manufacturing engineering students in psychomotor learning, which remains a challenge due to the high cost of instructional laboratories. the framework is applied to develop a participatory pedagogy for manufacturing courses through the use of computer numerical control of manufacturing operations, and real-time monitoring, visualization, and data analysis of machine energy use. the framework is demonstrated for upper-level undergraduate and graduate manufacturing engineering courses at two universities (i.e., computer-aided design and manufacturing at oregon state university and precision manufacturing at university of california, berkeley). it is found that the framework can effectively support learning module development in manufacturing engineering education.
fluid_mechanics	high speed self-excited oscillation pulsed waterjet (seopw) offers many advantages over continuous jets or external-excited pulsed jets and has a large number of practical and industrial applications, in order to take better advantage of seopws, effects of area discontinuity at nozzle inlet were analyzed based on the previous related research and then experimentally investigated with respect to the axial pressure oscillations. a jet-driven helmholtz oscillator, which is capable of producing effective seopws, was employed in the experiment. it was found that area discontinuity has a capacity of enhancing the peak, which largely depends on the inlet pressure and standoff distance. the enhancement decreases with increasing inlet pressure and only happens within small standoff distances. compared with the continuous case, area enlargement enhances the peak by 25%, 21%, and 16%, corresponding to inlet pressures of 10, 15, and 20 mpa, respectively; while area contraction turns to be a better one by improving the peak by 8% at inlet pressure of 25 mpa. however, at inlet pressure of 30 mpa, both enlargement and contraction decrease the peak. moreover, area discontinuity cannot influence the optimum standoff distance where the maximum peak appears. for the pressure oscillation amplitude, even both area discontinuities have the ability of increasing the amplitude regardless of inlet pressure and standoff distance, contraction enhances the amplitude much more than enlargement does at all the testing inlet pressures. in addition, area discontinuity has nearly no influence on the oscillating frequency and causes perturbations that may only affect the intensity of self-excitation by amplitude.

materials_engineering	nanotechnology is key to the 21st century, involving all aspects of nanoscale science and technology and generating a paradigm shift in diverse areas of physics, chemistry, electronics, materials, engineering, and even medicine and biology, as a result of its interdisciplinary nature. rf and terahertz electronics are among the fastest growing areas as a result of the discovery, fabrication, and investigation of nanomaterials, in particular carbon nanotubes, graphenes, and compound semiconductors. these advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of nano rf or terahertz devices, which are capable of transcending conventional devices in their compactness, efficiency, performance, and operating frequency. this paper sets out the evolution of nanotechnology in rf and terahertz electronics in which a challenge awaits for the microwave science and engineering research community.
materials_engineering	ceramic matrix composites (cmc) with continuous fiber reinforcements have the potential to enable the next generation of high speed hypersonic vehicles and/or significant improvements in gas turbine engine performance due to their exhibited toughness when subjected to high mechanical loads at extreme temperatures (2200f+). reinforced fiber composites (rfc) provide increased fracture toughness, crack growth resistance, and strength, though little is known about how stochastic variation and imperfections in the material effect material properties. in this work, tools are developed for quantifying anomalies within the microstructure at several scales. the detection and characterization of anomalous microstructure is a critical step in linking production techniques to properties, as well as in accurate material simulation and property prediction for the integrated computation materials engineering (icme) of rfc based components. it is desired to find statistical outliers for any number of material characteristics such as fibers, fiber coatings, and pores. here, fiber orientation, or 'velocity', and 'velocity' gradient are developed and examined for anomalous behavior. categorizing anomalous behavior in the cmc is approached by multivariate gaussian mixture modeling. a gaussian mixture is employed to estimate the probability density function (pdf) of the features in question, and anomalies are classified by their likelihood of belonging to the statistical normal behavior for that feature.
northern_blotting	we constructed a ssh (suppression subtractive hybridization) library based on two populations (rs-c and rs-p) of radopholus similis from different host plants and exhibiting differences in pathogenicity on musa paradisiaca and anthurium andraeanum plants. in order to screen the clones with significant expression differences from the ssh library, a total of 2,400 clones was randomly selected and reverse northern blotting was performed on them. out of the 2,400 clones, 89 clones showed significant expression differences. out of sequencing these 89 clones, distinct sequences from 87 clones were obtained. aligning the 87 distinct sequences against the non-redundant nucleotide database (nr) in ncbi, we found that five sequences were highly conserved with rs-eng-1b. two of five sequences with lengths of 467 base pairs (bp) (gw395922) and 742 bp (gw395923) were further employed to perform 5' race-pcr and 3' race-pcr, respectively. subsequently, the complete length of rs-eng-1b (eu414839) was obtained (1,427 bp). our qpcr result showed that expression of rs-eng-1b in the population rs-c with high pathogenicity on host plants was approximately 2.7 times as much as the expression of rs-eng-1b in the population rs-p with low pathogenicity on host plants. furthermore, the gene rs-eng-1b from the rs-c population also showed expression differences amongst four different development stages. the order of rs-eng-1b relative expression abundance from high to low was females, juveniles, males, and eggs. we further used rnai to test whether rs-eng-1b of rs-c population was responsible for pathogenicity which was the first rnai work about rs-eng-1b. the rnai results showed that rs-eng-1b expression had a positive correlation to pathogenicity of the population. the longer the rnai treatment, the less pathogenic the nematode population was. non-endogenous gfp dsrna had no significant influence on the expression of rs-eng-1b and pathogenicity of r. similis rs-c population. in conclusion, all our evidence indicated rs-eng-1b might be a crucial pathogenicity-related gene in r. similis.
human_metabolism	to obtain quantitative information on human metabolism of selenium, we have performed selenium speciation analysis by hplc/lcpms on samples of human urine from one volunteer over a 48-hour period after ingestion of selenium (1.0 mg) as sodium selenite, l-selenomethionine, or dl-selenomethionine. the three separate experiments were performed in duplicate. normal background urine from the volunteer contained total selenium concentrations of 8-30 mu g se/l (n=22) but, depending on the chromatographic conditions, only about 30-70% could be quantified by hplc/icpms. the major species in background urine were two selenosugars, namely methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-d-galactopyranoside (selenosugar 1) and its deacylated analog methyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-l-seleno-beta-d-galactopyranoside (selenosugar 3). selenium was rapidly excreted after ingestion of the selenium compounds: the peak concentrations (similar to 250-400 mu g se/l, normalized concentrations) were recorded within 5-9 hours, and concentrations had returned to close to background levels within 48 hours, by which time 25-40% of the ingested selenium, depending on the species ingested, had been accounted for in the urine. in all experiments, the major metabolite was selenosugar 1, constituting either similar to 80% of the total selenium excreted over the first 24 hours after ingestion of selenite or l-selenomethionine or similar to 65% after ingestion of dl-selenomethionine. selenite was not present at significant levels (< 1 mu g se/l) in any of the samples; selenomethionine was present in only trace amounts (similar to 1 mu g/l, equivalent to less than 0.5% of the total se) following ingestion of l-selenomethionine, but it constituted about 20% of the excreted selenium (first 24 hours) after ingestion of dl-selenomethionine, presumably because the d form was not efficiently metabolized. trimethylselenonium ion, a commonly reported urine metabolite, could not be detected (<1 mu g/l) in the urine samples after ingestion of selenite or selenomethionine. cytotoxicity studies on selenosugar 1 and its glucosamine isomer (selenosugar 2, methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-d-glucosopyranoside) were per-formed with hepg2 cells derived from human hepatocarcinoma, and these showed that both compounds had low toxicity (about 1000-fold less toxic than sodium selenite). the results support earlier studies showing that selenosugar i is the major urinary metabolite after increased selenium intake, and they suggest that previously accepted pathways for human metabolism of selenium involving trimethylselenonium ion as the excretionary end product may need to be re-evaluated.
enzymology	since adrian brown and victor henri 's work, the simplest enzyme kinetics model, which contains only three rate constants k(1), k(2) and k(-1) in 1902, has been thoroughly explored in many directions. by using the michaelis-menten equation, k-m and k(2) can be measured quickly. all the three rate constants can be derived by temperature jump method or transient state kinetics, but both methods need more complicated techniques and equipments. in our previous paper (li et al. in j math chem 46: 290-301, 2009), we gave a method to measure all the rate constants which does not require any additional equipment other than those needed for measuring k-m and k(2). here, we propose a new one which needs no additional equipment either. this method is based on a study of inflection points of integral curves. numerical results show that the new one is much better than the previous one in two aspects: near the end of the reaction, the new one gives more accurate estimation; during the quasi-steady state of the reaction, it also gives good estimations while the previous one can not. hence, this method not only advances the estimation accuracy, but also has more choices for measuring.
northern_blotting	fragile x syndrome (fxs) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation disease. this is caused due to expansion of cgg triplet in 5'-untranslated region of fragile x mental retardation 1 (fmr-1) gene. in most of the cases, abnormally large size of the cgg repeat (>200) undergoes hypermethylation, which in turn silences the fmr-1 gene causing thereby complete lack of its protein product called fragile x mental retardation protein (fmrp). lack of fmrp due to gene silencing or production of faulty protein due to point mutation in kh2 domain of fmrp alters the translational process in neurons and leads to expression of mental retardation phenotype on the patients. the fmrp is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues; however, it is predominantly expressed in neurons and testis. it possesses heterogeneity and is found in many isoforms due to alternative splicing of the fmr-1 transcript. based on our data from the western-, slot-, northern blotting and immunohistochemical studies, we report here the down regulation of fmr-1 gene and fmrp in mice brain in age-dependent manner. the present finding is important in respect to fmrp-dependent various brain functions i.e., learning, memory, cognition etc. that decrease with advancing age.
northern_blotting	our previous studies demonstrated that sodium glucose cotransporter 1 (sglt-1) was induced in the remnant ileum of total colectomized rats via the action of factors other than hyperaldosteronism. the aim of the present study was to clarify whether fecal stream is required for the enhancement of sglt-1-mediated sodium transport. twenty-seven pairs of ileal tissues were obtained from the proximal and distal side, respectively, of loop ileostomy after total proctocolectomy. mucosae were mounted in an ussing chamber to evaluate glucose-coupled sodium transport. levels of sglt-1 mrna in proximal and distal mucosae were compared by northern blotting. villous height and crypt depth were measured to test for correlations between mucosal structure and sglt-1-mediated sodium transport or mrna expression levels. both glucose-coupled sodium transport and expression of sglt-i mrna were significantly lower in distal mucosae relative to proximal mucosae. in distal mucosae, villous height, but not crypt depth, was significantly lower than in proximal mucosae, demonstrating a positive correlation between villous height and sglt-1 function and expression. comparative studies of proximal and distal mucosae demonstrated that in addition to hormonal changes, fecal stream is required for full induction of the sodium transport system (which includes sglt-1-mediated transport) in the remnant ileum following total proctocolectomy.

internal_combustion_engine	the polymer electrolyte membrane (pem) fuel cell system is considered to be an ideal alternative for the internal combustion engine, especially when used on a city bus. hybrid buses with fuel cell systems and energy storage systems are now undergoing transit service demonstrations worldwide. a hybrid pem fuel cell city bus with a hierarchical control system is studied in this paper. firstly, the powertrain and hierarchical control structure is introduced. secondly, the vehicle control strategy including start-stop strategy, energy management strategy, and fuel cell control strategy, including the hydrogen system and air system control strategies, are described in detail. finally, the performance of the fuel cell was analyzed based on road test data. results showed that the different subsystems were well-coordinated. each component functioned in concert in order to ensure that both safety and speed requirements were satisfied. the output current of the fuel cell system changed slowly and the output voltage was limited to a certain range, thereby enhancing durability of the fuel cell. furthermore, the economic performance was optimized by avoiding low load conditions.
polymerase_chain_reaction	in this study, a specific and sensitive method for simultaneous detection of human astrovirus, human rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus and enteric adenovirus associated with acute enteritis was developed, based on the specific dual priming oligonucleotide (dpo) system and the sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis. the dpo system-based multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) combined with hplc assay was more sensitive than agarose gel electrophoresis analysis and real-time sybr green pcr assay, and showed a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 96%-100%. the high sensitivity and specificity of the assay indicates its great potential to be a useful tool for the accurate diagnosis of enteric virus infections.

cell_biology	oxygen plays a key role in stem cell biology as a signaling molecule and as an indicator of cell energy metabolism. quantification of cellular oxygen kinetics, i.e. the determination of specific oxygen uptake rates (sours), is routinely used to understand metabolic shifts. however current methods to determine sour in adherent cell cultures rely on cell sampling, which impacts on cellular phenotype. we present real-time monitoring of cell growth from phase contrast microscopy images, and of respiration using optical sensors for dissolved oxygen. time-course data for bulk and peri-cellular oxygen concentrations obtained for chinese hamster ovary (cho) and mouse embryonic stem cell (mescs) cultures successfully demonstrated this non-invasive and label-free approach. additionally, we confirmed non-invasive detection of cellular responses to rapidly changing culture conditions by exposing the cells to mitochondrial inhibiting and uncoupling agents. for the cho and mescs, sour values between 8 and 60 amol cell(-1) s(-1), and 5 and 35 amol cell(-1) s(-1) were obtained, respectively. these values compare favorably with literature data. the capability to monitor oxygen tensions, cell growth, and sour, of adherent stem cell cultures, non-invasively and in real time, will be of significant benefit for future studies in stem cell biology and stem cell-based therapies.
molecular_biology	purpose of review atp-citrate lyase (acly) has re-emerged as a drug target for ldl cholesterol (ldl-c) lowering. we review acly as a therapeutic strategy, its genetics, its molecular and cellular biology, and also its inhibition. recent findings acly is a critical enzyme linking glucose catabolism to lipogenesis by providing acetyl-coa from mitochondrial citrate for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. human genetic variants have been associated with enhanced growth and survival of several cancers, and with attenuated plasma triglyceride responses to dietary fish oil. in mice, liver-specific acly deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia, whereas adipose tissue-specific acly deletion has no phenotype, supporting therapeutic inhibition of acly. a lipid-regulating compound, bempedoic acid, was discovered to potently inhibit acly, and in animal models, it prevents dyslipidemia and attenuates atherosclerosis. phase 2 clinical trials revealed that bempedoic acid effectively lowers ldl-c as monotherapy, combined with ezetimibe, added to statin therapy and in statin-intolerant hypercholesterolemic patients. summary the efficacy of bempedoic acid as an ldl-c-lowering agent has validated acly inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. positive results of phase 3 patient studies, together with long-term cardiovascular disease outcome trials, are required to establish acly as a major new target in cardiovascular medicine.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background the time of progression towards aids can vary greatly among seropositive patients, and may be associated with host genetic variation. the nr1i2 (pxr) gene, a ligand-activated transcription factor, regulates the transcription immune pathway genes and can therefore be targets of viral replication mechanisms influencing time of progression to aids. objective to verify the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) rs3814057, rs6785049, rs7643645, and rs2461817 in the nr1i2 (pxr) gene with progression to aids in hiv-1 infected patients. methods blood samples were obtained from 96 hiv-1 positive individuals following informed consent. dna was isolated and genotyped through real time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the presence of snps in the nr1i2. questionnaires on socio-demographic features and behaviors were answered and time of progression to aids was estimated based on medical chart analysis. findings patients with the gg genotype for rs7643645 were shown to be related with a more rapid disease progression when compared to ga and aa genotypes. this result was maintained by the multivariate cox regression considering sex, ethnicity, and presence of hla-b*57, hla-b*27, and ccr5del32 polymorphisms. main conclusions recent studies reported the expression of the nuclear receptors in t-lymphocytes, suggesting their possible role in the immune response. in addition, nuclear receptors have been shown to inhibit the hiv replication, although no such mechanism has been thoroughly elucidated to date. this is the first time an association between nr1i2 polymorphism and time of progression to aids is reported and supports an apparent relationship between the gene in the immune response and identifies another genetic factor influencing aids progression.
enzymology	the addition of two electrons and two protons to the c-17=c-18 bond in protochlorophyllide is catalyzed by a light-dependent enzyme relying on nadph as electron donor, and by a light-independent enzyme bearing a (cys)(3)asp-ligated [ 4fe-4s] cluster which is reduced by cytoplasmic electron donors in an atp-dependent manner and then functions as electron donor to protochlorophyllide. the precise sequence of events occurring at the c-17=c-18 bond has not, however, been determined experimentally in the dark-operating enzyme. in this paper, we present the computational investigation of the reaction mechanism of this enzyme at the b3lyp/6-311+ g(d, p)//b3lyp/6-31g(d) level of theory. the reaction mechanism begins with single-electron reduction of the substrate by the (cys) 3asp-ligated [ 4fe-4s], yielding a negatively-charged intermediate. depending on the rate of fe-s cluster re-reduction, the reaction either proceeds through double protonation of the single-electron-reduced substrate, or by alternating proton/electron transfer. the computed reaction barriers suggest that fe-s cluster re-reduction should be the rate-limiting stage of the process. poisson-boltzmann computations on the full enzyme-substrate complex, followed by monte carlo simulations of redox and protonation titrations revealed a hitherto unsuspected ph-dependence of the reaction potential of the fe-s cluster. furthermore, the computed distributions of protonation states of the his, asp and glu residues were used in conjuntion with single-point oniom computations to obtain, for the first time, the influence of all protonation states of an enzyme on the reaction it catalyzes. despite exaggerating the ease of reduction of the substrate, these computations confirmed the broad features of the reaction mechanism obtained with the medium-sized models, and afforded valuable insights on the influence of the titratable amino acids on each reaction step. additional comparisons of the energetic features of the reaction intermediates with those of common biochemical redox intermediates suggest a surprisingly simple explanation for the mechanistic differences between the dark-catalyzed and light-dependent enzyme reaction mechanisms.
manufacturing_engineering	sport research activities often require graphical user interfaces (gui) for viewing, merging, tagging and processing of data. more complex processing, like video, requires more complex interfaces but often these guis are for short term research use and the investment in creating or purchasing and adapting the gui is lost. this paper demonstrates an auto generation gui creation tool using matlab environment. any gui is created using a text file that defines all component properties, including the figure, its controls and the callbacks. the auto generation gui was used in this paper for the creation of a video digitizing interface for monitoring upper arm and forearm rotations of cricket bowlers. this method simplifies the creation and modification of guis used in research.

internal_combustion_engine	in this two-part paper, a topological analysis of powertrains for refuse-collecting vehicles (rcvs) based on the simulation of different architectures (internal combustion engine, hybrid electric, and hybrid hydraulic) on real routes is proposed. in this first part, a characterization of a standard route is performed, analyzing the average power consumption and the most frequent working points of an internal combustion engine (ice) in real routes. this information is used to define alternative powertrain architectures. a hybrid hydraulic powertrain architecture is proposed and modelled. the proposed powertrain model is executed using two different control algorithms, with and without predictive strategies, with data obtained from real routes. a calculation engine (an algorithm which runs the vehicle models on real routes), is presented and used for simulations. this calculation engine has been specifically designed to analyze if the different alternative powertrain delivers the same performance of the original ice. finally, the overall performance of the different architectures and control strategies are summarized into a fuel and energy consumption table, which will be used in the second part of this paper to compare with the different architectures based on hybrid electric powertrain. the overall performance of the different architectures indicates that the use of a hybrid hydraulic powertrain with simple control laws can reduce the fuel consumption up to a 14 %.
immunology	background: anaphylaxis diagnostic criteria were proposed at the second symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis. these criteria were 97% sensitive and 82% specific when retrospectively validated. objective: to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases/food allergy and anaphylaxis network (niaid/faan) criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ed). methods: we conducted a prospective observational study of patients seen in our institution 's ed from april 2010 to march 2013. patients seeking care for an allergic reaction and possible anaphylaxis were enrolled. patients and providers completed questionnaires regarding onset, trigger, and signs and symptoms. records were reviewed independently and blindly by 2 board-certified allergist-immunologists, and their final diagnosis (anaphylaxis vs no anaphylaxis) was used as the reference standard. two-by-two tables were built, and test characteristics were calculated. results: among the 174 enrolled patients, 91 (52%) met the niaid/faan criteria for anaphylaxis. the allergist-immunologists diagnosed 61 cases of anaphylaxis (35%), of which 58 (95%) also satisfied the niaid/faan criteria. the interrater agreement between allergist-immunologists was substantial (k = 0.7). test characteristics (95% cis) of the niaid/faan criteria were as follows: sensitivity, 95.1% (85.4%-98.7%); specificity, 70.8% (61.4%-78.8%); positive predictive value, 63.7% (52.9%-73.4%); negative predictive value, 96.4% (89.1%-99.1%); positive likelihood ratio, 3.26; and negative likelihood ratio, 0.07. conclusions: prospectively, the niaid/faan criteria continued to be highly sensitive (95%) but had lower specificity (71%) than on retrospective assessment. these criteria are likely to be useful for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the ed.

manufacturing_engineering	a great deal of attention in manufacturing engineering has been focused on finishing operations of hard and brittle materials in recent years. this paper reports an experimental work on the analysis of surface roughness and material removal using design of experiment (doe) method in magnetic abrasive finishing, (maf) of flat surfaces. change in surface roughness and material removal were found to increase with an increase in weight percentage of abrasive particles in magnetic abrasive brush, lubricant volume and decrease in working gap. also, any decrease in the relative size of the abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles would result into an increase of the surface roughness and decrease in material removal. it was observed that the work piece hardness had no considerable effect on the process results. the optimum parameter levels which lead into the best surface finish and highest material removal were also derived from these experimentations. optimum levels included weight percentage of abrasive particles of 40%, lubricant volume of 1 ml, working gap of 3 mm, relative size of abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles of 0.22, and work piece hardness of 82-87 hbn. disk type test pieces were selected from al 7075 and their two side surfaces were under experiments. experiments were made using a milling machine spindle as magnetic pole holder, and its table as fixture holder for work pieces.
human_metabolism	food security is the main concern of government due to malnutrition worldwide. the aim of this study was to assess macronutrients and amino acids in five species of grasshoppers, consumed in rural and urban communities. samples were captured in different agro climatic environment conditions, wherever vegetation grows, and the macronutrients were raw, analyzed in dry basis by the aoac methods and amino acids by cation exchange chromatography. the obtained data showed a high protein content, ranging from 70% to 75%; lipids 4% to 6%; minerals 3% to 5%; fiber 6% to 8% and soluble carbohydrates 6% to 18%, including essential amino acids that play an important role in human metabolism, with tryptophan as limiting factor. the different species of the studied grasshoppers are high in proteins, essential macromolecules for human life that decrease protein-energy malnutrition; the excess of amino acids after releasing the amino group will provide energy, as well as soluble carbohydrates. they also have minerals that are needed to prevent anemia, and fiber, non-digestible carbohydrates essential in a healthy diet. in conclusion, the daily consumption of 5 or 6 grasshoppers is a good source of nutrients that will provide optimal health to population.
polymerase_chain_reaction	currently in china, the schistosomiasis control program has shifted its focus from transmission control to the elimination of the disease. effective forecast and surveillance systems of schistiosomiasis are of great importance for issuing timely and early warnings on risk of infection, and therefore implementing preventive measures to avoid infection. there is great demand in more sensitive and specific methods to improve the surveillance system for early detection of s. japonicum infection in sentinel mice. in this study, we reported a sensitive nested-pcr assay targeting a 303-bp fragment from highly repetitive retrotransposon sjchgcsi9 to detect the s. japonicum dna in sera of experimental mice. meanwhile, detection efficacy of the nested-pcr was compared with two conventional methods for field monitoring schistosomiasis such as elisa and iha. the nested-pcr assay could detect the specific dna at 3-day post infection in sera of mice with 5 cercariae infection, while for elisa and iha, both show negative results even after 2 weeks post-infection in mice with 20 cercariae infection. our results demonstrated the dna based assay was more sensitive to make early diagnosis of s. japonicum infection in sentinel mice models, which will improve the early-warning ability of schistosomiasis surveillance system.

molecular_biology	metagenomics is a robust, interdisciplinary approach for studying microbial community composition, function, and dynamics. it typically involves a core of molecular biology, microbiology, ecology, statistics, and computational biology. exciting outcomes anticipated from these studies include unraveling of complex interactions that characterize the ecological milieu of microbial communities. diverse habitats from which metagenomes have been reported include human guts, caterpillar guts, thermal vents in oceans, ore deposits, polar caps, and even soils that adhere to plant roots. knowledge generated from metagenomic projects has tremendous potential to benefit human health, agriculture, and ecosystem functions. this article provides a brief history of technical advances in metagenomics, including dna sequencing methods, and some case studies. a specific example is provided of microbial metagenomes found at the roots of native grass species (family poaceae) that can grow on degraded lands undergoing revegetation.
human_metabolism	lipids are a diverse class of metabolites that play several key roles in the maintenance of human health. lipidomics, which focuses on the global study of molecular lipids in cells, tissues, and biofluids, has been advancing rapidly over the past decade. recent developments in ms and computational methods enable the lipid analysis with high throughput, resolution, sensitivity, and ability for structural identification of several hundreds of lipids. in nutrition research, lipidomics can be effectively used to elucidate the interactions between diet, nutrients, and human metabolism. lipidomics can also be applied to optimize the effects of food processing on the dietary value, and in the evaluation of food-related health effects.
hydraulics	instream wood promotes habitat heterogeneity through its influence on flow hydraulics and channel geomorphology. within the columbia river basin, usa, wood is vital for the creation and maintenance of habitat for threatened salmonids. however, our understanding of the relative roles of the climatic, geomorphic, and ecological processes that source wood to streams is limited, making it difficult to identify baseline predictions of instream wood and create targets for stream restoration. here, we investigate how instream wood frequency and volume differ between seven sub-basins of the interior columbia river basin and what processes shape these differences within these sub-basins. we collected data on wood volume and frequency, discharge and stream power, and riparian and watershed forest structure for use in modelling wood volume and frequency. using random forest models, we found that mean annual precipitation, riparian tree cover, and the individual watershed were the most important predictors of wood volume and frequency. within sub-basins, we used linear models, finding that some basins had unique predictors of wood. discharge, watershed area, or precipitation often combined with forest cover, riparian conifer, and/or large tree cover in models of instream large wood volume and frequency. in many sub-basins, models showed at least one hydrologic variable, indicative of transport competence and one ecological variable, indicative of the reach or upstream watershed 's capability to grow measurable instream wood. we conclude that basin-specific models yield important insights into the hydrologic and ecological processes that influence wood loads, creating tractable hypotheses for building predictive models of instream wood. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
polymerase_chain_reaction	backgroundpatterns of influenza molecular viral shedding following influenza infection have been well established; predictors of viral shedding however remain uncertain. objectiveswe sought to determine factors associated with peak molecular viral load, duration of shedding, and viral area under the curve (auc) in children and adult hutterite colony members with laboratory-confirmed influenza. methodsa cohort study was conducted in hutterite colonies in alberta, canada. flocked nasal swabs were collected during three influenza seasons (2007-2008 to 2009-2010) from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infected with influenza. samples were tested by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza a and influenza b, and the viral load was determined for influenza a-positive samples. resultsfor seasonal h1n1, younger age was associated with a larger auc, female sex was associated with decreased peak viral load and reduced viral shedding duration, while the presence of comorbidity was associated with increased peak viral load. for h3n2, younger age was associated with increased peak viral load and increased auc. for pandemic h1n1, younger age was associated with increased peak viral load and increased viral auc, female sex was associated with reduced peak viral load, while inapparent infection was associated with reduced peak viral load, reduced viral shedding duration, and reduced viral auc. conclusionspatterns of molecular viral shedding vary by age, sex, comorbidity, and the presence of symptoms. predictor variables vary by influenza a subtype.
southern_blotting	glutathione s-transferases (gsts) are ubiquitous enzymes in animals and plants, and they are multifunctional proteins encoded by a large gene family. gsts are involved in response to the oxidative stress including drought, salt, heavy metals, and so on. under oxidative stress, the excessive reactive oxygen species (ros) induce an increase in gst levels, and then the gsts metabolize the toxic products of lipid peroxidation, damaged dna and other molecules. previously, a full-length cdna of a novel zeta gst gene, ppgst, was characterized from fruit of pyrus pyrifolia nakai cv. huobali. in the present study, a constitutive plant expression vector of ppgst was constructed and transferred into tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l. cv xanthi) to verify the function of ppgst. as a result, the ppgst gene was successfully integrated into the genome of the transgenic tobacco lines and expressed as expected in the transformants through southern blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) analysis. growth of t1 generation plants of ppgst transgenic lines and wt under non-stressful conditions was similar, however, the transgenic tobacco lines showed relatively normal growth under drought, nacl, and cadmium (cd) stresses. furthermore, the t1 transgenic tobacco lines showed significantly slower superoxide anion production rate than the wt under abiotic stress. simultaneously, the mda content of each t1 transgenic tobacco plant was only slightly increased and significantly lower than that of the wt under drought, salt and cd stress. together with the gst activity of the transgenic tobacco lines, which was significantly increased under stressful conditions, as compared with that in wt, overexpression of ppgst in tobacco enhanced the tolerance of transgenic tobacco lines to oxidative damage caused by drought, nacl, and cd stresses.
cell_biology	the accuracy of water models derived from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations by means on an improved force-matching scheme is assessed for various thermodynamic, transport, and structural properties. it is found that although the resulting force-matched water models are typically less accurate than fully empirical force fields in predicting thermodynamic properties, they are nevertheless much more accurate than generally appreciated in reproducing the structure of liquid water and in fact superseding most of the commonly used empirical water models. this development demonstrates the feasibility to routinely parametrize computationally efficient yet predictive potential energy functions based on accurate ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for a large variety of different systems.

internal_combustion_engine	battery electric vehicles (bevs) have been slow to diffuse on the international as well as the swedish market. previous studies have indicated situational factors such as economic factors, size and performance to be of major importance for vehicle purchasers in their choice of vehicle. in this paper, the authors explore a consumer centric total cost of ownership (tco) model to investigate the possible discrepancy between purchase price and the tco between internal combustion engine vehicles (icevs), hybrid electric vehicles (hevs) and bevs. the creation and testing of the tco model reveals that computation could be a challenging task for consumers due to bounded access of relevant data and the prediction of future conditions. the application of the model to the vehicle sample found that bevs could be cheaper compared to icevs and hevs. the findings in this paper could prove to be of importance for policy and marketing alike in designing the most appropriate business models and information campaigns based on consumer conditions in order to further promoting the diffusion of bevs in society.

hydraulics	we compared the hydrodynamics of replicate experimental mixed cell and replicate standard burrows pond rearing systems at the dworshak national fish hatchery, id, in an effort to identify methods for improved solids removal. we measured and compared the hydraulic residence time, particle removal efficiency, and measures of velocity using several tools. computational fluid dynamics was used first to characterize hydraulics in the proposed retrofit that included removal of the traditional burrows pond dividing wall and establishment of four counter rotating cells with appropriate drains and inlet water jets. hydraulic residence time was subsequently established in the four full scale test tanks using measures of conductivity of a salt tracer introduced into the systems both with and without fish present. vertical and horizontal velocities were also measured with acoustic doppler velocimetry in transects across each of the rearing systems. finally, we introduced abs sinking beads that simulated fish solids then followed the kinetics of their removal via the drains to establish relative purge rates. the mixed cell raceway provided higher mean velocities and a more uniform velocity distribution than did the burrows pond. vectors revealed well-defined, counter-rotating cells in the mixed cell raceway, and were likely contributing factors in achieving a relatively high particle removal efficiency-88.6% versus 8.0% during the test period. we speculate retrofits of rearing ponds to mixed cell systems will improve both the rearing environments for the fish and solids removal, improving the efficiency and bio-security of fish culture. we recommend further testing in hatchery production trials to evaluate fish physiology and growth. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license.
immunology	introduction: primary sjogren 's syndrome (pss) is one of the autoimmune diseases characterized by polyclonal autoantibody production. the human homologue of the mouse double minute 2 (mdm2) is an important negative regulator of p53. our previous study indicated that autoantibody to mdm2 can be detected in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. the purpose of this study is to study anti-mdm2 autoantibody in pss patients. methods: anti-mdm2 autoantibody in sera from 100 pss patients and 74 normal controls was investigated by elisa. positive samples were further confirmed by western blotting. expression of mdm2 in labial gland tissue from pss patients and normal controls was checked by immunohistochemistry. the difference in clinical characteristics and laboratory findings between anti-mdm2 positive and anti-mdm2 negative pss patients was analyzed. results: the presence of anti-mdm2 autoantibody in pss patients was 21.0%, significantly higher than normal controls (5.40%). mdm2 was overexpressed in labial gland from pss patients. pss patients with positive anti-mdm2 were characterized by longer disease duration and more lymphocytes focal gathering in labial gland. prevalence of anemia, thrombocytopenia and anti-ssb was significantly higher in pss patients with anti-mdm2 autoantibody. titer of anit-mdm2 was negatively associated with hemoglobin level, platelet count, complement 3 level and complement 4 level, positively associated with european sjogren 's syndrome disease activity index (essdai) and level of igg. conclusions: anti-mdm2 autoantibody may be used as a potential serological biomarker in pss disease activity evaluation. study on the role of anti-mdm2 or mdm2 in pss may help us know the pathogenesis mechanism of pss better.
cell_biology	background: recent works have suggested a possible link between interleukin (il)-33 and b-cell biology. we aimed to study the possible association between serum il-33 detection and response to rituximab (rtx) in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients in different cohorts with an accurate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). methods: serum il-33, rheumatoid factor (rf), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-ccp), and high serum immunoglobulin (ig) g levels were assessed in 111 ra patients receiving a first course of 2 g rtx (cohort 1) in an observational study and in 74 ra patients treated with the same schedule in routine care (cohort 2). univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with a european league against rheumatism (eular) response at 24 weeks. results: at week 24, 84/111 (76%) and 54/74 (73%) patients reached eular response in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. serum il-33 was detectable in only 33.5% of the patients. in the combined cohorts, the presence of rf or anti-ccp (odds ratio (or) 3.27, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.13-9.46; p = 0.03), high serum igg (or 2.32, 95% ci 1.01-5.33; p = 0.048), and detectable serum il-33 (or 2.40, 95% ci 1.01-5.72; p = 0.047) were all associated with rtx response in multivariate analysis. the combination of these three factors increased the likelihood of response to rtx. when serum il-33 detection was added to seropositivity and serum igg level, 100% of the patients with the three risk factors (corresponding to 9% of the population) responded to rtx (or versus patients with none of the three risk factors 29.61, 95% ci 1.30-674.79; p = 0.034). conclusion: detectable serum il-33 may predict clinical response to rtx independently of, and synergistically with, auto-antibodies and serum igg level.
immunology	in the treatment of hemophilia a, the 20%-30% risk of developing of anti-factor viii (fviii) antibodies, or inhibitors, is the dominant concern among healthcare providers. immune tolerance induction remains the only effective method of eradicating inhibitors in approximately 75% of patients, but is accompanied by significant emotional and economical burden. while certain risk factors, such as the type of fviii mutation, offer some insight, there remains no strategy to confidently predict the development of an inhibitor. moreover, even if such a predictive tool existed, there is currently no proven protocol for tolerance induction of a previously untreated patient. in recent years, the growing body of knowledge concerning the fundamental immunology of inhibitors has shed light on potential therapeutic interventions. in this review, we highlight these new findings and their influences on translational medicine.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper shows the performance curves obtained with an experimental campaign on the following different prime movers: a 100 kw microturbine, a 20 kw internal combustion engine, a 450 kw sofc-based hybrid system and a 100 kw absorption chiller. while the size related to the microturbine and the engine are actual electrical power values, the hybrid system size is an electrical virtual power (an emulator rig was used for this plant) and the chiller value is a cooling thermal power. these experimental results were obtained with a smart polygeneration facility installed in the innovative energy systems laboratory by the thermochemical power group of the university of genoa. this facility was designed to perform tests on smart grids equipped with different generation technologies to develop and improve innovative control and optimization tools. the performance curves were obtained with two different approaches: tests on real prime movers (for the microturbine, the engine and the chiller) or measurements on an emulator rig (for the hybrid system). in this second case, the tests were carried out using an experimental facility based on the coupling of a second microturbine with a modular vessel. a real-time simulation software was used for components not physically present in the experimental plant. these results are a significant improvement in comparison with the available data, because experimental results are presented for different prime movers in different operative conditions (both design and part-load operations). moreover, since both manufacturers and users are not usually able to control air inlet temperature, special attention was devoted to the ambient temperature impact on the 100 kw microturbine because this property has a strong influence on the performance of this machine. for this reason, empirical correlations on the ambient temperature effect were obtained from the experiments with the objective to perform an easy implementation of the optimization tools. experimental performance curves (including several off-design conditions) are essential for smart grid management because (if they are implemented in optimization tools) they allow to find real optimal solutions (while tools based on linear or calculated correlations can obtain results affected by significant errors).

computer-aided_design	purpose a 3d printer was used to realise compartmental dosage forms containing multiple active pharmaceutical ingredient (api) formulations. this work demonstrates the microstructural characterisation of 3d printed solid dosage forms using x-ray computed microtomography (x mu ct) and terahertz pulsed imaging (tpi). methods printing was performed with either polyvinyl alcohol (pva) or polylactic acid (pla). the structures were examined by x mu ct and tpi. liquid self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (snedds) formulations containing saquinavir and halofantrine were incorporated into the 3d printed compartmentalised structures and in vitro drug release determined. results a clear difference in terms of pore structure between pva and pla prints was observed by extracting the porosity (5.5% for pva and 0.2% for pla prints), pore length and pore volume from the x mu ct data. the print resolution and accuracy was characterised by x mu ct and tpi on the basis of the computer-aided design (cad) models of the dosage form (compartmentalised pva structures were 7.5 +/- 0.75% larger than designed; n = 3). conclusions the 3d printer can reproduce specific structures very accurately, whereas the 3d prints can deviate from the designed model. the microstructural information extracted by x mu ct and tpi will assist to gain a better understanding about the performance of 3d printed dosage forms.
cell_biology	numerous studies have examined the role of micrornas (mirnas) in cell homeostasis and cardiovascular disease and have markedly improved our understanding of rna biology in general and the potential role of mirnas in atherosclerosis. in atherosclerosis, several mirnas, such as mir-33a,b, mir-92a, mir-126 and others, have been identified that are relevant mediators of pathological processes, including regulation of cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis, lipoprotein metabolism and cholesterol efflux, but also immune responses, endothelial cell biology and vascular function. further understanding of the specific roles of mirnas in the distinct cell types involved in atherosclerosis initiation, progression and resolution may reveal new intervention strategies for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

southern_blotting	lepidopteran larvae are the most injurious pests of chinese cabbage production. we attempted the development of transgenic chinese cabbage expressing the potato proteinase inhibitor ii gene (pinii) and bioassayed the pest-repelling ability of these transgenic plants. cotyledons with petioles from aseptic seedlings were used as explants for agrobacterium-mediated in vitro transformation. agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 contained the binary vector pbbbasta-pinii-bar comprising pial and bar genes. plants showing vigorous ppt resistance were obtained by a series concentration selection for ppt resistance and subsequent regeneration of leaf explants dissected from the putative chimera. transgenic plants were confirmed by pcr and genomic southern blotting, which showed that the bar and pinii genes were integrated into the plant genome. double haploid homozygous transgenic plants were obtained by microspore culture. the pinii expression was detected using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) and detection of pinii protein content in the transgenic homozygous lines. insect-feeding trials using the larvae of cabbage worm (pieris rapae) and the larvae of the diamondback moth (plutella xylostella) showed higher larval mortality, stunted larval development, and lower pupal weights, pupation rates, and eclosion rates in most of the transgenic lines in comparison with the corresponding values in the non-transformed wild-type line.
machine_design	this paper deals with torque ripple minimization using a degree of liberty offered when the doubly fed induction machine is employed in electrical naval propulsion. various strategies have been carried out on the analysis and the reduction of torques ripples. the torque ripples can be reduced by either the machine design or control methods. the authors introduce a new technique to decrease its torque ripples using the control strategy. simulation results and experimental tests are presented and discussed.
thermodynamics	recent work has demonstrated that black hole thermodynamics and information loss/restoration in ads(3)/cft2 can be derived almost entirely from the behavior of the virasoro conformal blocks at large central charge, with relatively little dependence on the precise details of the cft spectrum or ope coefficients. here, we elaborate on the non-perturbative behavior of virasoro blocks by classifying all 'saddles' that can contribute for arbitrary values of external and internal operator dimensions in the semiclassical large central charge limit. the leading saddles, which determine the naive semiclassical behavior of the virasoro blocks, all decay exponentially at late times, and at a rate that is independent of internal operator dimensions. consequently, the semiclassical contribution of a finite number of high-energy states cannot resolve a well-known version of the information loss problem in ads(3). however, we identify two infinite classes of sub-leading saddles, and one of these classes does not decay at late times.
computer-aided_design	purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different reconstruction plates and screw combinations on stress distribution of segmental resected mandibles using finite element analysis. methods: lateral (l) and lateral-central (lc) defects were simulated by a computer aided design modeling. the straight (s) and angular (a) titanium locking reconstruction plates of 2.5 mm(12 holes for l defects and 16 holes for lc defects) were modeled. each screw was 2.5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length. a total of 20 different screw placement combinations were created. the bite force used in the present model was a unilateral molar clench. the data obtained from finite element analysis were recorded as von mises, maximum principle and minimum principle stress values. results: it was observed that stress values on neck of screw were higher for screws close to the resection area. when the first screw was loosened, the stress on the plate body and the remaining screws increased. principle stress values were within the tolerance limits of the bone. conclusion: the highest stress is observed in the screws nearest to the resection edge. therefore, it is very important to place a screw adjacent to the resection edge.
immunology	the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of nucleotide transition (g/a) in position -2518 of the mcp-1 gene related to the susceptibility of developing ra. two hundred twenty-three consecutive ra patients according to 2010 acr/eular criteria were included; 120 healthy subjects were used as controls. mcp-1 -2518 a/g polymorphism (ag + gg) was present in 162 (72.6 %) ra patients and in 63 (52.5 %) healthy subjects [or 2.44 (ic95% 1.53-3.88, p = 0.0002)]; associations for heterozygotes and homozygotes were or 1.92 (ic95% 1.19-3.15, p = 0.001) and or 5.19 (ic95% 2.34-11.51, p = 0.001), respectively. in argentine patients, mcp-1 gene polymorphism confers susceptibility for developing ra.
cell_biology	glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk-3) is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in an array of critical cellular processes. gsk-3 was first characterized as an enzyme that phosphorylated and inactivated glycogen synthase. however, subsequent studies have revealed that this moon-lighting protein is involved in numerous signaling pathways that regulate not only metabolism but also have roles in: apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell renewal, differentiation, embiyogenesis, migration, regulation of gene transcription, stem cell biology and survival. in this review, we will discuss the roles that gsk-3 plays in various diseases as well as how this pivotal kinase interacts with multiple signaling pathways such as: pi3k/pten/akt/mtor, ras/raf/mek/erk, wnt/beta-catenin, hedgehog, notch and tp53. mutations that occur in these and other pathways can alter the effects that natural gsk-3 activity has on regulating these signaling circuits that can lead to cancer as well as other diseases. the novel roles that micrornas play in regulation of the effects of gsk-3 will also be evaluated. targeting gsk-3 and these other pathways may improve therapy and overcome therapeutic resistance.

polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate two different types of implant-abutment connections: screwed connection and cemented connection, analyzing peri-implant bacteria microflora as well as other clinical parameters. patients and methods: twenty implants were selected, inserted in 20 patients, 10 with a screwed implant-abutment connection (group 1) and 10 with a cemented implant-abutment connection (group 2). the peri-implant microflora was collected, after at least 360 days from the prosthetic rehabilitation, using paper points inserted in peri-implant sulcus for 30 s. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) real-time analyzed the presence of 9 bacteria periodontal-pathogens and candida albicans. results: our findings showed that bacteria colonized all groups analyzed, the average bacterial count was 3.7 e + 08 (+/- 1.19) in group 1, compared to 2.1 e + 08 (+/- 0.16) in group 2; no statistically significant differences were observed (p >0.0.5). in group 1, however, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for 5 bacteria, indicating a high-risk of peri-implantitis. also in group 2, results showed a microflora composed by all bacteria analyzed but, in this case, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for only 1 bacterium, indicating a lower risk of peri-implantitis. moreover, clinical parameters (ppd >3 mm and m sbi >0) confirmed a greater risk of peri-implantitis in group 1 compared to group 2 (p < 0.05). conclusions: we concluded that, also after only 360 days, implants with screwed connection showed a higher risk of peri-implantitis that implants with cemented connection.
southern_blotting	analyzing the basic mechanism of dna double-strand breaks (dsb) formation during meiosis is important for understanding sexual reproduction and genetic diversity. the location and amount of meiotic dsbs can be examined by using a common molecular biological technique called southern blotting, but only a subset of the total dsbs can be observed; only dsb fragments still carrying the region recognized by a southern blot probe are detected. with the assumption that dsb formation follows a nonhomogeneous poisson process, we propose two estimators of the total number of dsbs on a chromosome: (1) an estimator based on the nelson-aalen estimator, and (2) an estimator based on a record value process. further, we compared their asymptotic accuracy.
machine_design	the breakthroughs in permanent magnet synchronous machines through the latest technologies, especially about machine design, raise the importance of those machines. moreover, developments in materials technology implement the development of cost effective and profitable products on electric machines. permanent magnet synchronous machines are divided into two parts according to the situation of slot/pole combination, which is integer or fractional. permanent magnet synchronous machines are subject of interest due to low torque ripple and low cogging torque. in this paper, the 2d lumped parameter method (lpm) of permanent magnet synchronous machine was composed and stated, and lumped parameter was verified by finite element method. when smc materials are used in electric machines, flux flows in 3d. because of this and according to literatures, 3d method is used to analyze the smc-used machines. 3d finite element method takes a quite long time. thanks to 2d lpm analysis, which was used in our work; the analysis period become remarkably shorter. in addition, torque and back emf of permanent magnet synchronous machine were calculated through the developed lpm method. prototype is tested. it is seen by the results that the produced prototype and the developed algorithm are matching properly.
immunology	significance: in the last years, metabolic reprogramming, fluctuations in bioenergetic fuels, and modulation of oxidative stress became new key hallmarks of tumor development. in cancer, elevated glucose uptake and high glycolytic rate, as a source of adenosine triphosphate, constitute a growth advantage for tumors. this represents the universally known warburg effect, which gave rise to one major clinical application for detecting cancer cells using glucose analogs: the positron emission tomography scan imaging. recent advances: glucose utilization and carbon sources in tumors are much more heterogeneous than initially thought. indeed, new studies emerged and revealed a dual capacity of tumor cells for glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) metabolism. oxphos metabolism, which relies predominantly on mitochondrial respiration, exhibits fine-tuned regulation of respiratory chain complexes and enhanced antioxidant response or detoxification capacity. critical issues: oxphos-dependent cancer cells use alternative oxidizable substrates, such as glutamine and fatty acids. the diversity of carbon substrates fueling neoplastic cells is indicative of metabolic heterogeneity, even within tumors sharing the same clinical diagnosis. metabolic switch supports cancer cell stemness and their bioenergy-consuming functions, such as proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. moreover, reactive oxygen species-induced mitochondrial metabolism and nutrient availability are important for interaction with tumor microenvironment components. carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and immune cells participate in the metabolic interplay with neoplastic cells. they collectively adapt in a dynamic manner to the metabolic needs of cancer cells, thus participating in tumorigenesis and resistance to treatments. future directions: characterizing the reciprocal metabolic interplay between stromal, immune, and neoplastic cells will provide a better understanding of treatment resistance.
internal_combustion_engine	a modified thermostatic control strategy is applied to the powertrain control of a parallel mild hybrid electric vehicle (hev) to improve fuel economy. this strategy can improve the fuel economy of a parallel mild hev by operating internal combustion engine (ice) in a high-efficiency region. thus, in this study, experiments of a parallel mild hey were conducted to analyze the characteristics of the hybrid electric powertrain and a numerical model is developed for the vehicle. based on the results, the thermostatic control strategy was modified and applied to the vehicle model. also, battery protection logic by using electrochemical battery model is applied because the active usage of battery by thermostatic control strategy can damage the battery. the simulation results of the vehicle under urban driving conditions show that the thermostatic control strategy can improve the vehicle 's fuel economy by 3.7 % compared with that of the conventional strategy. the results also suggest that the trade-off between the fuel economy improvement by efficient ice operation and the battery life reduction by active battery usage should be carefully investigated when a thermostatic control strategy is applied to a parallel mild hev.
molecular_biology	craniofacial bone defects are challenging problems for maxillofacial surgeons over the years. with the development of cell and molecular biology, gene therapy is a breaking new technology with the aim of regenerating tissues by acting as a delivery system for therapeutic genes in the craniofacial region rather than treating genetic disorders. a systematic review was conducted summarizing the articles reporting gene therapy in maxillofacial surgery to answer the question: was gene therapy successfully applied to regenerate bone in the maxillofacial region? electronic searching of online databases was performed in addition to hand searching of the references of included articles. nolanguage or time restrictions were enforced. meta-analysis was done to assess significant bone formation after delivery of gene material in the surgically induced maxillofacial defects. the search identified 2081 articles, of which 57 were included with 1726 animals. bone morphogenetic proteins were commonly used proteins for gene therapy. viral vectors were the universally used vectors. sprague-dawley rats were the frequently used animal model in experimental studies. the quality of the articles ranged from excellent to average. meta-analysis results performed on 21 articles showed that defects favored bone formation by gene therapy. funnel plot showed symmetry with the absence of publication bias. gene therapy is on the top list of innovative strategies that developed in the last 10 years with the hope of developing a simple chair-side protocol in the near future, combining improvement of gene delivery as well as knowledge of the molecular basis of oral and maxillofacial structures.
molecular_biology	in recent years, the disposal of former industrial sites has widely become a key subject of interest in terms of remediation in order to promote their different use for the community. the use of biological processes, such as phytoremediation, has been worldwide discussed with varying success. in this study, we applied an integrated phytoremediation system (ips), which represents a cost-effective system, environmentally friendly, socially accepted for the removal of the risks associated with the contamination of heavy metal (as, cd, pb and zn) of unsaturated soils. the combination of suitable agronomic soil management and biostimulation of plant growth by inoculation of rhizosphere microbes allowed to increase biomass production of selected plant species (acacia saligna and eucalyptus camaldulensis) in very stressful conditions and, consequently, promote the phytoremediation of contaminants. the experimental study in situ revealed a significant positive aptitude of selected plant species to keep ptes (potential toxic elements) in their root system, with a restricted translocation to the aboveground parts. the ""plant-fungi-bacteria"" system in rhizosphere level showed, also, strong ability to remove the bioavailable fraction of contaminants with a considerable reduction of the risks associated to the contamination. this study reveals that the application of an integrated phytoremediation system (ips) permits to reach the soil remediation in few years with economically, socially and environmentally sustainable costs.

southern_blotting	to investigate the function and evolutionary origin of the soxe subgroup, we amplified the genomic dna of misgurnus anguillicaudatus using a pair of degenerate primers. using race, we obtained two versions of sox8 (masox8a and masox8b) from m. anguillicaudatus. the overall sequence identity of the deduced amino acids from the two genes was 54.38%, with only one amino acid change in the high-mobility group domain. southern blotting and evidence from the phylogenetic tree provided further proof for the existence of two sox8 genes at the genomic level. this is the first evidence of two distinct sox8 genes in cypriniformes. semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative pcr assays showed the expression trend of the genes was opposite in early embryonic development, and both were expressed ubiquitously in several adult tissues. the similar expression patterns indicated that masox8a and masox8b have possible overlapping functions.
immunology	objectives. to perform a state of the art about immunological features in renal transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs and their mechanisms of action and immunologically high risk transplantations such as abo and hla-incompatible transplantation. material and methods. an exhaustive systematic review of the scientific literature was performed in the medline database and embase using different associations of the following keywords (mesh): ""allogenic response; allograft; immunosuppression; abo incompatible transplantation; donor specific antibodies; hla incompatible; desensitization; kidney transplantation"". publications obtained were selected based on methodology, language, date of publication (last 10 years) and relevance. prospective and retrospective studies, in english or french, review articles; meta analysis and guidelines were selected and analyzed. this search found 4717 articles. after reading titles and abstracts, 141 were included in the text, based on their relevance. results. the considerable step in comprehension and knowledge allogeneic response this last few years allowed a better used of immunosuppression and the discover of news immunosuppressive drugs. in the first part of this article, the allogeneic response will be described. the different classes of immunosuppressive drugs will be presented and the actual management of immunosuppression will be discussed. eventually, the modalities and results of immunologically high-risk transplantations such as abo and hla incompatible transplantations will be reported. conclusions. the knowledge and the control of allogeneic response to allogeneic graft allowed the development of renal transplantation.

fluid_mechanics	a fluid flow along a semi-infinite plate with small periodic irregularities on the surface is considered for large reynolds numbers. the boundary layer has a double-deck structure: a thin boundary layer (""lower deck"") and a classical prandtl boundary layer (""upper deck""). the aim of this paper is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the stationary solution of a rayleigh-type equation, which describes oscillations of the vertical velocity component in the classical boundary layer.
genetics	there are common aspects and mechanisms between different types of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (nmosds), and autoimmune encephalitis (ae) as well as paraneoplastic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system. to our present knowledge, depending on the disease, t and b cells as well as antibodies contribute to various aspects of the pathogenesis. possibly the events leading to the breaking of tolerance between the different diseases are of great similarity and so far, only partially understood. beside endogenous factors (genetics, genomics, epigenetics, malignancy) also exogenous factors (vitamin d, sun light exposure, smoking, gut microbiome, viral infections) contribute to susceptibility in such diseases. what differs between these disorders are the target molecules of the immune attack. for t cells, these target molecules are presented on major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules as mhc-bound ligands. b cells have an important role by amplifying the immune response of t cells by capturing antigen with their surface immunoglobulin and presenting it to t cells. antibodies secreted by plasma cells that have differentiated from b cells are highly structure specific and can have important effector functions leading to functional impairment or/and lesion evolvement. in ms, the target molecules are mainly myelin-and neuron/axon-derived proteins; in nmosd, mainly aquaporin-4 expressed on astrocytes; and in ae, various proteins that are expressed by neurons and axons.
molecular_biology	rapid and progressive advances in molecular biology techniques and the advent of next generation sequencing (ngs) have opened new possibilities for analyses also in the identification of entomological matrixes. insects and other arthropods are widespread in nature and those found at a crime scene can provide a useful contribution to forensic investigations. entomological evidence is used by experts to define the postmortem interval (pmi), which is essentially based on morphological recognition of the insect and an estimation of its insect life cycle stage. however, molecular genotyping methods can also provide an important support for forensic entomological investigations when the identification of species or human genetic material is required. this case study concerns a collection of insects found in the house of a woman who died from unknown causes. initially the insects were identified morphologically as belonging to the pediculidae family, and then, human dna was extracted and analyzed from their gastrointestinal tract. the application of the latest generation forensic dna assays, such as the quantifiler (r) trio dna quantification kit and the hid-ion ampliseq (tm) identity panel (applied biosystems (r)), individuated the presence of human dna in the samples and determined the genetic profile.

polymerase_chain_reaction	effective and sensitive methods for the molecular detection of echinococcus multilocularis in faecal samples of final hosts are crucial for the prevention and control of human alveolar echinococcosis and for studies on the epidemiology of the parasite. little is known about the suitability of commercial test kits for isolating dna of e. multilocularis from fox faeces and the performance of standard polymerase chain reaction (pcr) protocols in relation to the quality of dna extracted by these kits. we compared four different kits: zr faecal dna miniprep (tm) (zymo research), fastdna (r) spin kit for soil (mp biomedicals), qiaamp (r) fast dna stool mini kit (qiagen) and nucleospin (r) soil kit (macherey-nagel) for the extraction of dna from e. multilocularis eggs present in faeces of foxes. negative faecal samples were spiked with 600, 300, 150, 75, 37, 18, 9, 5 or 2 e. multilocularis eggs, and each egg concentration was tested 10 times with each of the dna extraction kits. each extracted dna sample was amplified using three pcr protocols: i. conventional pcr (cpcr, platinum (r) taq, invitrogen), ii. qpcr with the iq (tm) supermix (bio-rad) and iii. qpcr with the quantitect (r) multiplex -master mix (qiagen). the highest analytical sensitivities for molecular detection of e. multilocularis eggs in spiked fox faeces were observed when combining either the qiaamp (r) fast dna stool mini kit or the zr faecal dna miniprep (tm) kit with the qpcr using the quantitect (r) multiplex -master mix (sensitivities 97% and 94%, respectively). combinations including the remaining test kits (nucleospin (r) soil kit and fastdna (r) spin kit for soil) showed a markedly lower analytical sensitivity for pcr examinations. the results of the present study indicate that it is of utmost importance to select suitable dna extraction kits in combination with robust pcr methods or reagents to achieve acceptable analytical sensitivity in the molecular detection of e. multilocularis eggs in fox faecal samples.

immunology	1. host-parasitoid systems are characterized by a continuous development of new defence strategies in hosts and counter-defence mechanisms in parasitoids. this co-evolutionary arms race makes host-parasitoid systems excellent for understanding trade-offs in host use caused by evolutionary changes in host immune responses and parasitoid virulence. however, knowledge obtained from natural host-parasitoid systems on such trade-offs is still limited. 2. in this study, the aim was to examine trade-offs in parasitoid virulence in asecodes parviclava (hymenoptera: eulophidae) when attacking three closely related beetles: galerucella pusilla, galerucella calmariensis and galerucella tenella (coleoptera: chrysomelidae). a second aim was to examine whether geographic variation in parasitoid infectivity or host immune response could explain differences in parasitism rate between northern and southern sites. 3. more specifically, we wanted to examine whether the capacity to infect host larvae differed depending on the previous host species of the parasitoids and if such differences were connected to differences in the induction of host immune systems. this was achieved by combining controlled parasitism experiments with cytological studies of infected larvae. 4. our results reveal that parasitism success in a. parviclava differs both depending on previous and current host species, with a higher virulence when attacking larvae of the same species as the previous host. virulence was in general high for parasitoids from g. pusilla and low for parasitoids from g. calmariensis. at the same time, g. pusilla larvae had the strongest immune response and g. calmariensis the weakest. these observations were linked to changes in the larval hemocyte composition, showing changes in cell types important for the encapsulation process in individuals infected by more or less virulent parasitoids. 5. these findings suggest ongoing evolution in parasitoid virulence and host immune response, making the system a strong candidate for further studies on host race formation and speciation.
human_metabolism	early diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism is commonly performed through biofluid metabolomics, which detects specific metabolic biomarkers whose concentration is altered due to genomic mutations. the identification of new biomarkers is of major importance to biomedical research and is usually performed through data mining of metabolomic data. after the recent publication of the genome-scale network model of human metabolism, we present a novel computational approach for systematically predicting metabolic biomarkers in stochiometric metabolic models. applying the method to predict biomarkers for disruptions of red-blood cell metabolism demonstrates a marked correlation with altered metabolic concentrations inferred through kinetic model simulations. applying the method to the genome-scale human model reveals a set of 233 metabolites whose concentration is predicted to be either elevated or reduced as a result of 176 possible dysfunctional enzymes. the method 's predictions are shown to significantly correlate with known disease biomarkers and to predict many novel potential biomarkers. using this method to prioritize metabolite measurement experiments to identify new biomarkers can provide an order of a 10-fold increase in biomarker detection performance. molecular systems biology 28 april 2009; doi:10.1038/msb.2009.22
manufacturing_engineering	we present a collaborative teaching model used in the practical classes of manufacturing engineering. this model has been developed by teachers from one of the innovative educational groups ""nuevas metodologias docentes en ingenieria mecanica y de fabricacion"" (new learning methodologies in mechanical engineering and manufacturing) at universidad politecnica de madrid (upm). it is implemented in the five degrees presently taught at the escuela tecnica superior de ingenieria y diseno industrial (etsidi) (faculty of engineering and industrial design) at upm. in this model, traditional practical lessons are combined with a web platform, developed on our own, named ""plataforma educativa de practicas academicas"" (pepa) (academic learning platform for practical classes), that allows both the automatic registration of the results from laboratory classes and the evaluations by teachers, automatically or manually.

strength_of_materials	the design procedures currently applied in dimensioning of structural and load-bearing components of conveyances do not specify their safe service life, instead they are based on safety factors related to static loads. in order to solve this problem and to work out verified relationships to find the fatigue endurance of structural elements of conveyances in the function of service time and the type of conveyance it is required that that the values of all applied loads be considered in the function of time and in the normal operating conditions. this study, compiling the results of research work undertaken at the department of strength of materials and structures agh-ust, provides analytical formulas verified experimentally on real objects, yielding: maximal loads experienced by the conveyance suspensions and hoisting ropes during the start-up of a fully loaded conveyance moving from the bottom station; maximal loads experienced by the conveyance suspensions and hoisting ropes during the braking of a fully loaded conveyance approaching the top station; loads in the guiding system (skip head- shalt steelwork; skip lower frame- shaft steelwork) during the skip travel at the fixed speed v(0).
genetics	objective. owing to the rapid increase in clinical need, we aimed to implement and review the performance of a mainstreaming model of germline brca1/2 genetic testing in eligible women with high grade non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer via a genetic counselor embedded in the gynecology oncology clinic. methods. the model implemented involved a specialized referral form, weekly genetics-lead multidisciplinary review of referrals, and pre-and post-test genetic counseling provided by an embedded genetic counselor during chemotherapy chair time. performance and outcomes were retrospectively audited over the following two consecutive one year periods, including survey data on medical specialist comfort with mainstreaming and the model. results. sixty-four women underwent mainstreamed brca1/2 testing over the two year post-implementation period with a rate of detection of brca1/2 pathogenic variants of 17%. the referral rate for eligible women significantly increased to over 90% (p90% of patients receiving results during first line chemotherapy. genetic counseling time decreased from 120 to 54 min. cancer specialists were comfortable with the model. conclusions. the mainstreaming model proved effective, increasing uptake of genetic testing in eligible patients to over 90%; it was efficient for patients, genetic counselors and cancer specialists and acceptable to cancer specialists. it facilitated co -location of genetic and oncology service delivery but separation of clinical responsibility for genetic testing to a specialist genetics service, ensuring accurate and robust patient -centred care.

internal_combustion_engine	this study is based on an earlier one (1995) containing a proposed taxonomic classification which we have now reviewed and updated according to the growth and emergence of these practices during this period. on an intrinsic level, we studied the purpose and nature of these activities and rethought and analysed the relevance and appropriateness of 'adventure physical activities in nature' (apan) as a valid name to identify them. on an extrinsic level, we identified the apan that are currently being significantly performed by part of the population worldwide and we restructured and completed the taxonomic classification of 1995 with the specific presence of a new emerging sector 'fire' due to the increasing presence of practices that use the internal combustion engine. we built a table identifying each of the selected apan practices and drew up a table of environmental impacts with four pollutant classifications. finally, we developed a coordinate axis in which we link the degree of sportisation of the groups of practices with the 'asceticism/hedonism' variable. in the previous study we distinguished three major mediums, 'air', 'earth' and 'water', with 6 groups (a), 13 groups (e) and 8 groups (w) respectively. in total, we structured 27 groups and we clearly identified 33 practices. in the current study we have four mediums, 'air', 'earth', 'water' and 'fire', with 5 groups (a), 12 groups (e), 8 groups (w) and 4 groups (f). in summary, we build 29 groups and we distinguish 98 practices.
human_metabolism	this study was conducted to determine the secretion rate and composition of lipoproteins secreted by hepg2 cells as influenced by the type of fatty acid present in the incubation medium. cells were preincubated for 24 h with palmitic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic or conjugated linoleic acid (cla), and the lipoproteins secreted during a subsequent incubation period of 24 h were collected for analysis. the secretion rate of apolipoprotein b-100 (apob) was significantly greater in hepg2 cells preincubated with elaidic acid compared with those preincubated with palmitic or oleic acid; apob secretion was greater in cells preincubated with cla compared with those preincubated with linoleic acid. the lipid composition of secreted lipoproteins was also influenced by fatty acid treatment, resulting in significantly smaller lipoprotein particles secreted by cells preincubated with elaidic acid and cla compared with those secreted by cells treated with oleic acid and linoleic acid, respectively. our results are relevant to human metabolism for the following reasons: (1) the size of plasma low-density lipoproteins (ldls) is determined, at least in part, by the composition of apob-containing lipoproteins secreted by the liver; (2) small plasma ldl particles are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease; and (3) specific dietary fatty acids can affect the composition and size of plasma ldls, thereby imparting a relative atherogenicity to plasma ldls independent of ldl cholesterol concentration. the present study therefore suggests that elaidic acid and cla promote the hepatic secretion of small apob-containing lipoproteins, which could lead to an increased production of small plasma ldl particles.

polymerase_chain_reaction	long-term peritoneal dialysis (pd) leads to ultrafiltration failure (uff). peritoneal mesothelial cells, which form the innermost monolayer of the peritoneal cavity, have been shown to regulate various responses, including inflammation, in uff. the present study was designed to investigate the effect of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (ppar-gamma) agonist, rosiglitazone, on peritoneal dialysis solution (pds)-induced injuries in rat peritoneal mesothelial cells (rpmcs). rpmcs were cultured for different durations and with different concentrations of pds. the gene expression levels of aquaporin-1 (aqp-1) and zonula occluden-1 (zo-1) were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. the protein levels of aqp-1, zo-1 and ppar-gamma were measured using western blot analysis. interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were detected using elisa. the rpmcs were damaged by stimulation with 4.25% pds for 72 h. the expression levels of aqp-1 and zo-1 were increased, and the secretion of il-6 and il-8 were decreased by rosiglitazone. the use of the ppar-gamma inhibitor, gw-9662, completely prevented the effects of rosiglitazone. these results indicated that pds exposure stimulated an inflammatory response in the rpmcs. the ppar-gamma activator, rosiglitazone, appeared to relieve the injury by inhibiting inflammation, and regulating the expression of aqp-1 and zo-1, however further investigations are required to elucidate the potential underlying mechanism.
internal_combustion_engine	dynamic development of internal combustion engines creates a need to adopt a strategy concerning operational use of these driving units based on the knowledge of their technical condition. the assessment of technical condition belongs to tasks of technical diagnostics. this article presents an analysis of issues concerning vibration diagnostics of automatic compensators of clearances in piston valves of combustion engine. scientific experiments focused on delivering information necessary to create (and also to validate) diagnostic models enabling assessment of technical condition of those elements of combustion engine that are essential taking into account effectiveness and durability that were carried out and described here. on the basis of the worked out diagnostic model, the algorithm for assessment of the technical condition of automatic compensators of valve clearance was created.

materials_engineering	the crystal structure of a metal plays an important role in its relationship to its macroscopic properties as well as atomic mechanisms of structural change. as such, students need to have an ability to visualize planar crystal atomic packing features, but often find it difficult. thus, the research question here is, ""how can a student 's baseline knowledge and misconceptions of planar atomic packing features for different metal structures be measured and how well can instruction promote conceptual change and misconception repair."" answering this question will provide insight for developing more effective pedagogy for crystal structures. a multiple-choice survey with six items was developed using misconceptions from students' pencil and paper sketches of face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) atoms on (100), (110), and (111) planes. pretests and posttests of the survey were administered to students in a spring 2012 introductory materials engineering course. misconceptions that were revealed included: missing atoms, extra atoms, misplaced atoms, ""non-touching atoms where they should touch""; and ""touching atoms that should not touch"". students' difficulty in solving increased from (100) to (110) to (111) planes for both bcc and fcc structures. details of the survey instrument and results are described in the paper.
internal_combustion_engine	recent demands to reduce pollutant emissions and improve energy efficiency have driven the implementation of hybrid solutions in mobile machinery. this paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental analysis conducted on a hydraulic hybrid excavator (hhe). the machinery under study is a middle size excavator, whose standard version was modified with the introduction of an energy recovery system (ers). the proposed ers layout was designed to recover the potential energy of the boom, using a hydraulic accumulator as a storage device. the recovered energy is utilized through the pilot pump of the machinery which operates as a motor, thus reducing the torque required from the internal combustion engine (ice). the analysis reported in this paper validates the hhe model by comparing numerical and experimental data in terms of hydraulic and mechanical variables and fuel consumption. the mathematical model shows its capability to reproduce the realistic operating conditions of the realized prototype, tested on the field. a detailed energy analysis comparison between the standard and the hybrid excavator models was carried out to evaluate the energy flows along the system, showing advantages, weaknesses and possibilities to further improve the machinery efficiency. finally, the fuel consumption estimated by the model and that measured during the experiments are presented to highlight the fuel saving percentages. the hhe model is an important starting point for the development of other energy saving solutions.
machine_design	this paper presents a design approach for interior permanent-magnet (ipm) machines with variable-flux characteristics using low-coercive-force magnets for improved efficiency and extended operating speed range. a flux-intensifying ipm type with l-d >l-q is used in the design due to positive i-d operation and reduced loaded i-q effects. design considerations of machine structures and variable-flux machine attributes are discussed. in addition, leakage flux in a rotor is particularly designed to also obtain another flux-varying capability. evaluation of the designed machine is provided by finite-element analysis simulations and experiments on a proof-of-principle machine. the designed machine shows benefits in increasing efficiency and speed range in a low-torque region when variable magnetization control of the low-coercive-force magnets or the design of the leakage flux proposed in this paper is implemented.
machine_design	this paper reviews grinding research led by professor w brian rowe at liverpool john moores university and at other establishments previously. research reviewed extends over fundamentals of grinding processes and machine performance carried out over fifty-five years. topics range from accuracy in centreless grinding and other grinding processes to grinding machine behaviour and high precision grinding machine design including bearing technology. research also ranges to high removal rate grinding processes, surface integrity and intelligent process control. this review highlights progress in selected areas and demonstrates that improving product quality allows improved manufacturing productivity.
cell_biology	objective: the study aims to assess the frequency of cytological abnormalities in adolescents and young women, to establish the optimum age to start screening. methods: a retrospective study of cervical cytology results were obtained from the data center at the santa casa hospital of sao paulo between january 2006 and december 2014, adopting the bethesda nomenclature system. the cytology exams were divided into 3 groups: group 1-adolescents (10-19 years old); group 2-young women (20-24 years old); and group 3-adults, comprising the remaining cytology exams. the frequency of cytological abnormalities in the 3 groups was compared using version 3.4.3 of the epi info software programand the chi-square statistical test (p < .05). results: a total of 177,075 satisfactory cytology exams were included in the study. the cytological abnormalities detected in the adolescent group were predominantly low-grade lesions (97.4%); in the young women group, low-grade lesions represented 89.12%, and in the adult group, 76.33%. a significantly greater proportion of high-grade lesions were noted in the adult group, accounting for approximately 24% of all abnormalities detected; in the young women group, it was approximately 11%, and in the adolescent group, it was 2.6%. conclusions: the natural history of hpv infection shows it is transient in young women, with most cases regressing within 2 years of presentation. our data confirm that screening of adolescents is not recommended because serious cytological abnormalities and cancer are rare in this group.
human_metabolism	human metabolism of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( dehp) is complex and yields mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( mehp) and numerous oxidative metabolites. the oxidative metabolites, mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (meohp), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mehhp), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mecpp) and mono(2-carboxymethylhexyl) phthalate (mcmhp), have been considered to be better biomarkers for dehp exposure assessment than mehp because urinary levels of these metabolites are generally higher than mehp, and their measurements are not subject to contamination. the urinary levels of the above metabolites, and of three other recently identified dehp oxidative metabolites, mono(2-ethyl-3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (mecprp), mono-2-(1-oxoethylhexyl) phthalate (moehp), and mono(2-ethyl-4-carboxybutyl) phthalate (mecbp), were measured in 129 adults. mecpp, mcmhp and mehhp were present in all the samples analysed. mehp and the other oxidative metabolites were detected less frequently: meohp (99%), mecbp (88%), mecprp (84%), mehp (83%) and moehp (77%). the levels of all dehp metabolites were highly correlated (pb/0.0001) with each other, confirming a common parent. the v and omega-1 oxidative metabolites ( mecpp, mcmhp, mehhp and meohp) comprised 87.1% of all metabolites measured, and thus are most likely the best biomarkers for dehp exposure assessment. the percentage of the unglucuronidated free form excreted in urine was higher for the ester linkage carboxylated dehp metabolites compared with alcoholic and ketonic dehp metabolites. the percentage of the unglucuronidated free form excreted in urine was higher for the dehp metabolites with a carboxylated ester side-chain compared with alcoholic and ketonic metabolites. further, differences were found between the dehp metabolite profile between this adult population and that of six neonates exposed to high doses of dehp through extensive medical treatment. in the neonates, mehp represented 0.6% and mecpp 65.5% of the eight dehp metabolites measured compared to 6.6% ( mehp) and 31.8% ( mecpp) in the adults. whether the observed differences reflect differences in route/duration of the exposure, age and/or health status of the individuals is presently unknown.
thermodynamics	the k-i of carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibitors is often determined by the stopped-flow co2 hydration assay, the method that directly follows the inhibition of ca enzymatic activity. however, the assay has limitations, such as largely unknown concentration of co2 and the inability to determine the k-i below several nm. the widely used direct binding assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, also does not determine the k-d below several nm. in contrast, the thermal shift assay can accurately determine picomolar affinities. new equations estimating co2 concentration were developed for the determination of k(cat) and km of ca i and ca ii. the inhibitor dose-response curves were analyzed using hill and morrison equations demonstrating that only the morrison model is applicable for the determination of tight-binding inhibitor k-i. the measurements of interactions between ten inhibitors and seven ca isoforms showed the limitations and advantages of all three techniques. inhibitor 6 exhibited the k-d of 50 pm and was highly selective towards human ca ix, an isoform which is nearly absent in healthy human, but highly over expressed in numerous cancers. combination of inhibition and binding techniques was necessary for precise determination of ca-high-affinity inhibitor interactions and future drug design.

molecular_biology	transcriptional enhancers are dna regulatory elements that are bound by transcription factors and act to positively regulate the expression of nearby or distally located target genes. enhancers have many features that have been discovered using genomic analyses. recent studies have shown that active enhancers recruit rna polymerase ii (pol ii) and are transcribed, producing enhancer rnas (ernas). gro-seq, a method for identifying the location and orientation of all actively transcribing rna polymerases across the genome, is a powerful approach for monitoring nascent enhancer transcription. furthermore, the unique pattern of enhancer transcription can be used to identify enhancers in the absence of any information about the underlying transcription factors. here, we describe the computational approaches required to identify and analyze active enhancers using gro-seq data, including data pre-processing, alignment, and transcript calling. in addition, we describe protocols and computational pipelines for mining gro-seq data to identify active enhancers, as well as known transcription factor binding sites that are transcribed. furthermore, we discuss approaches for integrating gro-seq-based enhancer data with other genomic data, including target gene expression and function. finally, we describe molecular biology assays that can be used to confirm and explore further the function of enhancers that have been identified using genomic assays. together, these approaches should allow the user to identify and explore the features and biological functions of new cell type-specific enhancers.
cell_biology	skeletal muscles are composed of myofibers, the biggest cells in the mammalian body and one of the few syncytia. how the complex and evolutionarily conserved structures that compose it are assembled remains under investigation. their size and physiological features often constrain manipulation and imaging applications. the culture of immortalized cell lines is widely used, but it can only replicate the early steps of differentiation. here, we describe a protocol that enables easy genetic manipulation of myofibers originating from primary mouse myoblasts. after one week of differentiation, the myofibers display contractility, aligned sarcomeres and triads, as well as peripheral nuclei. the entire differentiation process can be followed by live imaging or immunofluorescence. this system combines the advantages of the existing ex vivo and in vitro protocols. the possibility of easy and efficient transfection as well as the ease of access to all differentiation stages broadens the potential applications. myofibers can subsequently be used not only to address relevant developmental and cell biology questions, but also to reproduce muscle disease phenotypes for clinical applications.
immunology	it has recently become apparent that it is possible to characterize productively recombined, t-cell receptor (tcr) gene segments in tumor exome files, which presumably include representations of the dna of other cells in the microenvironment. similar characterizations have been done for tcr recombinations in tumor specimen rnaseq files. while exome files have been used to characterize immunoglobulin gene segment recombinations for tumors closely related to b-cells, immunoglobulin recombinations have yet to be characterized for putative microenvironment cells for solid tumors. here we report a novel scripted algorithm that detects productive and unproductive immunoglobulin recombinations in both b-cell related tumor exome files and in solid tumor exome files, with the most important result being the relatively high level b-cell infiltrate in breast cancer. this analysis has the potential of streamlining and dramatically augmenting the knowledge base regarding b-cell infiltrates into solid tumors; and leading to antibody reagents directed against tumor antigens and tissue resident, infectious pathogens.
cell_biology	background: human natural killer (nk) cell activity is regulated by a family of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kirs) that bind human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i. combinations of kir and hla genotypes are associated with disease, including susceptibility to viral infection and disorders of pregnancy. kir2dl1 binds hla-c alleles of group c2 (lys(80)). kir2dl2 and kir2dl3 bind hla-c alleles of group c1 (asn(80)). however, this model cannot explain hla-c allelic effects in disease or the impact of hla-bound peptides. the goal of this study was to determine the extent to which the endogenous hla-c peptide repertoire can influence the specific binding of inhibitory kir to hla-c allotypes. results: the impact of hla-c bound peptide on inhibitory kir binding was investigated taking advantage of the fact that hla-c*05:01 (hla-c group 2,c2) and hla-c*08:02 (hla-c group 1, c1) have identical sequences apart from the key kir specificity determining epitope at residues 77 and 80. endogenous peptides were eluted from hlac*05:01 and used to test the peptide dependence of kir2dl1 and kir2dl2/3 binding to hla-c*05:01 and hla-c*08:02 and subsequent impact on nk cell function. specific binding of kir2dl1 to the c2 allotype occurred with the majority of peptides tested. in contrast, kir2dl2/3 binding to the c1 allotype occurred with only a subset of peptides. cross-reactive binding of kir2dl2/3 with the c2 allotype was restricted to even fewer peptides. unexpectedly, two peptides promoted binding of the c2 allotype-specific kir2dl1 to the c1 allotype. we showed that presentation of endogenous peptides or hiv gag peptides by hla-c can promote kir cross- reactive binding. conclusion: kir2dl2/3 binding to c1 is more peptide selective than that of kir2dl1 binding to c2, providing an explanation for kir2dl3-c1 interactions appearing weaker than kir2dl1-c2. in addition, cross-reactive binding of kir is characterized by even higher peptide selectivity. we demonstrate a hierarchy of functional peptide selectivity of kir-hla-c interactions with relevance to nk cell biology and human disease associations. this selective peptide sequence-driven binding of kir provides a potential mechanism for pathogen as well as self-peptide to modulate nk cell activation through altering levels of inhibition.
genetics	the european winter moth, operophtera brumata, is a non-native pest in the northeastern usa causing defoliation of forest trees and crops such as apples and blueberries. this species is known to hybridize with o. bruceata, the bruce spanworm, a native species across north america, although it is not known if there are hybrid generations beyond f1. to study winter moth population genetics and hybridization with bruce spanworm, we developed two sets of genetic markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and microsatellites, using genomic approaches. both types of markers were validated using samples from the two species and their hybrids. we identified 1216 snps and 24 variable microsatellite loci. from them we developed a subset of 95 species-diagnostic snps and ten microsatellite loci that could be used for hybrid identification. we further validated the ten microsatellite loci by screening field collected samples of both species and putative hybrids. in addition to confirming the presence of f1 hybrids reported in previous studies, we found evidence for multi-generation asymmetric hybridization, as suggested by the occurrence of hybrid backcrosses with the winter month, but not with the bruce spanworm. laboratory crosses between winter moth females and bruce spanworm males resulted in a higher proportion of viable eggs than the reciprocal cross, supporting this pattern. we discuss the possible roles of population demographics, sex chromosome genetic incompatibility, and bacterial symbionts as causes of this asymmetrical hybridization and the utility of the developed markers for future studies.
materials_engineering	nanohub.org is an open-access cyberinfrastructure supported by the us national science foundation. it provides a powerful and versatile platform for delivering computational resources to support the implementation of integrated computational materials engineering (icme) solutions and associated educational efforts. nanohub provides free cloud scientific computing, where users can access simulation tools for research and education using a web-browser or ipad, without the need to install software or have access to local computing resources. the tools have friendly, fully-interactive graphical user interfaces, meaningful default values, output of both numerical data and visualizations, and extensive support material that provides an accessible pathway towards advanced materials simulations. on the back end, nanohub computational resources include high performance computing clusters that enable research-quality simulation. the nanohub platform can empower icme researchers and educators in two distinct ways: by using existing tools or by creating and publishing new, customized nanohub tools. existing nanohub tools are currently used to introduce icme simulations in courses in a variety of areas such as electronic structures, diffusion kinetics, and mechanics of materials. these tools were created by installing the available open source code into nanohub, then building custom graphical user interfaces (guis) using the rappture toolkit (rapid application infrastructure; http://rappture.org), which is integrated into the nanohub workspace. in a similar manner, instructors can install other simulation tools into nanohub using rappture to easily customize their tools to meet their learning objectives. this paper introduces existing nanohub icme tools, additional resources for materials science education, and the procedure for customizing and publishing new simulation tools on nanohub.
northern_blotting	in the present study, we have investigated the effect of (i) et-i (endothelin-1) and its precursor, big et-1, on mmp (matrix metal loproteinase)-2 and mmp-9 synthesis and activity in osteosarcoma tissue, and (ii) et-i receptor antagonists on cell invasion. using western blotting, zymography, rt-pcr (reverse transcription-pcr), immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and northern blotting, we have shown that et-i and et-i receptors (eta and etb) were expressed in these cells. additionally, we have demonstrated that et-i markedly induced the synthesis and activity of mmp-2, which was significantly increased when compared with mmp-9. furthermore, inhibition of nf-kappa b (nuclear factor kappa b) activation blocked mmp-2 production and activity, indicating the involvement of nf-kappa b, a ubiquitous transcription factor playing a central role in the differentiation, proliferation and malignant transformation. since et-i acts as an autocrine mediator through gelatinase induction and because inhibition of eta receptor is beneficial for reducing both basal and et-i-induced osteosarcoma cell invasion, targeting this receptor could be an attractive therapeutic alternative for the successful treatment of osteosarcoma.
genetics	systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, which affects multiple organs, including joints, skin, kidneys, heart, hematopoietic system, and nerve system. while the etiopathogenesis of sle still remains unclear, genetic susceptibilities and aberrant epigenetic modifications are believed to be involved. for precision therapy, it is necessary to assess accurately and objectively organ involvements and disease activity, which is difficult by current clinical laboratory tests. biomarkers, which are a biologic, genetic, epigenetic or a chemical characteristic and conveniently detectable, serve as measures of disease diagnosis, activity, prognosis, and manifestation prediction, thereby providing instruction for individualized therapy. in addition, biomarkers differ according to different manifestations, since the disease activity index and treatments vary significantly. for example, unlike other non-renal sle, lupus nephritis requires significant immunosuppressive drugs. over the past decades, the research on biomarkers in lupus has been strengthened and numerous promising biomarkers have been identified at levels of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. in this review, we summarize the conventional and novel biomarkers in the tissue-specific manner, and discuss their roles in specific organ diagnosis, future manifestation prediction, disease activity assessment and their correlation with histology results. by doing so, it aims to shed a light on individualized treatment.

polymerase_chain_reaction	strains of pseudomonas that produce antimicrobial metabolites and control soilborne plant diseases have often been isolated from soils defined as disease-suppressive, i.e., soils, in which specific plant pathogens are present, but plants show no or reduced disease symptoms. moreover, it is assumed that pseudomonads producing antimicrobial compounds such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (dapg) or phenazines (phz) contribute to the specific disease resistance of suppressive soils. however, pseudomonads producing antimicrobial metabolites are also present in soils that are conducive to disease. currently, it is still unknown whether and to which extent the abundance of antimicrobials-producing pseudomonads is related to the general disease resistance of common agricultural soils. moreover, virtually nothing is known about the conditions under which pseudomonads express antimicrobial genes in agricultural field soils. we present here results of the first side-by-side comparison of 10 representative swiss agricultural soils with a cereal-oriented cropping history for (i) the resistance against two soilborne pathogens, (ii) the abundance of pseudomonas bacteria harboring genes involved in the biosynthesis of the antimicrobials dapg, phz, and pyrrolnitrin on roots of wheat, and (iii) the ability to support the expression of these genes on the roots. our study revealed that the level of soil disease resistance strongly depends on the type of pathogen, e.g., soils that are highly resistant to gaeumannomyces tritici often are highly susceptible to pythium ultimum and vice versa. there was no significant correlation between the disease resistance of the soils, the abundance of pseudomonas bacteria carrying dapg, phz, and pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic genes, and the ability of the soils to support the expression of the antimicrobial genes. correlation analyses indicated that certain soil factors such as silt, clay, and some macro-and micronutrients influence both the abundance and the expression of the antimicrobial genes. taken together, the results of this study suggests that pseudomonads producing dapg, phz, or pyrrolnitrin are present and abundant in swiss agricultural soils and that the soils support the expression of the respective biosynthetic genes in these bacteria to various degrees. the precise role that these pseudomonads play in the general disease resistance of the investigated agricultural soils remains elusive.
fluid_mechanics	this article addresses a classical fluid mechanics problem where the effect of capillary action on a column of viscous liquid is analyzed by quantifying its time-dependent penetrated length in a narrow channel. despite several past studies, a rigorous mathematical formulation of this inherently unsteady process is still unavailable, because these existing works resort to a crucial assumption only valid for mildly transient systems. the approximate theories use an integral approach where the penetration is described by equating total force acting on the domain to rate of change of total momentum. however, while doing so, the viscous resistance under temporally varying condition is assumed to be same as the resistance created by a quasi-steady velocity profile. thus, leading order error appears due to such approximation which can only be true when the variation in time is not strong enough causing negligible transient deviation in the hydrodynamic quantities. the present paper proposes a new way to solve this problem by considering the unsteady field itself as an unknown variable. accordingly, the analysis applies an eigenfunction expansion of the flow with unknown time-dependent amplitudes which along with the unsteady intrusion length are calculated from a system of ordinary differential equations. a comparative exploration identifies the situation for which the integral approach and the rigorous technique based on eigenfunction expansion deviate from each other. it also reveals that the two methods differ substantially in short-time dynamics at the initial stage. then, an asymptotic perturbation shows how the two sets of results should coincide in their long-time behavior. in this way, the findings will provide a comprehensive understanding of the physics behind the transport phenomenon.
northern_blotting	intergeneric hybridization is an important strategy to introgress alien genes into common wheat for its improvement. but presence of cross ability barrier mechanism regulated by kr1 gene played a major destructive role for hybridization than other reported genes. in order to know the underlying molecular mechanism and to dissect out this barrier, a new annealing system, acp (anneling control primer) system was used in chromosome 5b (containing kr1 gene) specific recombinant inbred line (ril) population. two differentially expressed fragments for kr1 gene was identified, cloned and sequenced. further the expression was confirmed by northern blotting analysis. sequence analysis of the resulted clones revealed classes of putative genes, including stress responsive and signal transduction.
southern_blotting	mutants of shewanella oneidensis mr-1 that adapted to an electrode-respiring condition were selected from a random transposon-insertion mutant library to obtain active current-generating mutants and identify relevant cellular components. the mutants were selected in the presence of an electrode (poised at +0.2 v vs. an ag/agcl reference electrode) as the sole electron acceptor, and they were isolated on agar plates. transposon-insertion sites in the isolated mutants were identified by inverse pcr coupled to sequence analyses. southern blotting using a transposon probe was also performed to detect mutants that grew abundantly on the electrode. these analyses revealed that in many isolated mutants transposons were inserted in genes relevant to the synthesis of cell-surface structures, including so_3350 (pilus synthesis), so_3171 (polysaccharide synthesis), so_3174 (polysaccharide synthesis), and so_0165 (general secretion pathway). in microbial fuel cells, some of these (the so_3350 and so_4704 mutants) generated higher electrical outputs than wild-type mr-1, while the others generated lower outputs. the results suggest that cell-surface structures have a large influence on microbial current generation.
human_metabolism	objectives: adiponectin is a novel plasma protein produced exclusively in adipocytes. despite early data, its relationship with obesity and diabetes has been recently questioned. since plasma lipids influence diabetes and obesity, of concern is whether any associations between plasma lipids and adiponectin exist. design and methods: the aim of this study was to measure adiponectin levels and to investigate their associations with plasma cholesterol fractions and triglycerides in 73 obese non-diabetic subjects (44 women and 29 men), and 43 obese diabetic subjects (28 women and 15 men), aged 52.7 +/- 11.2 and 53.1 +/- 11 years, respectively, and matched for age, sex and bmi. the who definitions of obesity and diabetes were used. adiponectin was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: no correlations between adiponectin and total and ldl cholesterol levels were shown (for the whole cohort: r=0.0130; p=0.8899, and r=0.0807; p=0.3958, respectively). a positive correlation between hdl cholesterol levels and adiponectin occured predominantly in obese women without diabetes (r=0.4531; p=0.0023), resulting in an overall statistical trend in the whole cohort (r=0.2243; p=0.0164). a negative correlation between serum adiponectin and triglycerides was found (r=-0.3413; p=0.0002). conclusion: adiponectin correlated only with tg and partially with hdl but not with ldl and total cholesterol in the study group of obese diabetic and obese non diabetic subjects. in view of these results we suggest that the role of adiponectin in human metabolism is unclear and merits further investigation.
molecular_biology	high-temperature requirement a (htra; degp) from escherichia coli, an important element of the extracytoplasmic protein quality-control system, is a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of serine proteases. the characteristic feature of this protein is its allosteric mode of activation. the regulatory loops, l3, l2, l1 and ld, play a crucial role in the transmission of the allosteric signal. yet, the role of ld has not been fully elucidated. therefore, we undertook a study to explain the role of the individual ld residues in inducing and maintaining the proteolytic activity of htra. we investigated the influence of amino acid substitutions located within the ld loop on the kinetics of a model substrate cleavage as well as on the dynamics of the oligomeric structure of htra. we found that the mutations that were expected to disturb the loop 's structure and/or interactions with the remaining regulatory loops severely diminished the proteolytic activity of htra. the opposite effect, that is, increased activity, was observed for g174s substitution, which was predicted to strengthen the interactions mediated by ld. htrag174s protein had an equilibrium shifted toward the active enzyme and formed preferentially high-order oligomeric forms.
northern_blotting	the species brassica rapa includes various vegetable crops. production of these vegetable crops is usually impaired by heat stress. some micrornas (mirnas) in arabidopsis have been considered to mediate gene silencing in plant response to abiotic stress. however, it remains unknown whether or what mirnas play a role in heat resistance of b. rapa. to identify genomewide conserved and novel mirnas that are responsive to heat stress in b. rapa, we defined temperature thresholds of non-heading chinese cabbage (b. rapa ssp. chinensis) and constructed small rna libraries from the seedlings that had been exposed to high temperature (46 degrees c) for 1 h. by deep sequencing and data analysis, we selected a series of conserved and novel mirnas that responded to heat stress. in total, chinese cabbage shares at least 35 conserved mirna families with arabidopsis thaliana. among them, five mirna families were responsive to heat stress. northern hybridization and real-time pcr showed that the conserved mirnas bra-mir398a and bra-mir398b were heat-inhibitive and guided heat response of their target gene, braccsd1; and bra-mir156h and bra-mir156g were heat-induced and its putative target bracspl2 was down-regulated. according to the criteria of mirna and mirna* that form a duplex, 21 novel mirnas belonging to 19 mirna families were predicted. of these, four were identified to be heat-responsive by northern blotting and/or expression analysis of the putative targets. the two novel mirnas bra-mir1885b.3 and bra-mir5718 negatively regulated their putative target genes. 5'-rapid amplification of cdna ends pcr indicated that three novel mirnas cleaved the transcripts of their target genes where their precursors may have evolved from. these results broaden our perspective on the important role of mirna in plant responses to heat.
polymerase_chain_reaction	testicular maturation arrest is characterized by interruption of germ cell development and differentiation. genetic factors play important role in the causation of human disease, including male infertility. the objective was to study copy number variations in testicular maturation arrest using single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) microarray technique. conventional cytogenetics, targeted fluorescence insitu hybridization (fish) and sequence-tagged site (sts) polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were used to confirm some of the snp microarray findings. snp microarray on 68 cases of testicular maturation arrest detected copy number variations (cnvs) mostly on sex chromosomes involving pseudoautosomal regions (par) 1, 2 and 3 as well as azoospermic factors (azfs) besides three cases of chromosomal abnormalities (two klinefelter syndromes and one case of dicentric y). the azf deletion was observed in 14 (20.6%) cases and the azfc gain was observed in 6 (8.8%) cases. par 1 and 2 cnvs was observed in 5 (7.3%) cases. par 3 cnvs was detected in 19 cases and 2 controls. the tspy2 gene gain (within par 3 cnvs) was observed in 16 cases and 1 control. cnv containing autosomal genes possibly associated with male infertility in this study was spata31a2-a5 (9p12) in five cases. in this study, snp microarray identified possible underlying aetiology in 55.9% (38/68) cases besides identifying minimal critical region of azfc deletion as 0.51mb (y:24356128-24873665) involving tty5, rbmy2fp, rbmy1f, rbmy1j, tty6 and pry genes. snp microarray seems superior, sensitive, specific as well as cost-effective method and has potential to be the first tier investigations to explore underlying genomic factors of testicular maturation arrest. the present study is an attempt to find out probable genomic factors with idiopathic testicular maturation arrest.
immunology	background: severe bronchiolitis (ie, bronchiolitis requiring hospital admission) is thought to markedly increase asthma risk, with 30%-50% developing asthma by age 5 years. to date, studies of this association are small, and most are from outside the united states. objective: the objective of this study was to investigate the association between severe bronchiolitis and risk of asthma in a us birth cohort. methods: we studied a cohort nested within the massachusetts general hospital obstetric maternal study (moms), a prospective cohort of pregnant women enrolled during 1998-2006. children of mothers enrolled in moms were included in the analysis if they received care within our health system (n = 3653). diagnoses and medications were extracted from the children 's electronic health records; we also examined pregnancy and perinatal risk factors collected for the underlying pregnancy study. results: the birth cohort was 52% male, 49% white, and 105 infants (2.9%) had severe bronchiolitis. overall, 421 children (11.5%) developed asthma by age 5 years. among the children with severe bronchiolitis, 27.6% developed asthma by age 5 years. in multivariable logistic regression adjusting for 12 risk factors, severe bronchiolitis remained a strong risk factor for developing asthma by age 5 years (odds ratio 2.57; 95% confidence interval 1.61-4.09). conclusions: in a large boston birth cohort, the frequency of severe bronchiolitis and childhood asthma was similar to published data. among children with severe bronchiolitis, the risk of developing asthma was lower than prior studies but still high (27.6%). this difference may be due to different study designs, populations, and outcome definitions studied.

immunology	interleukin-9 is a cytokine classically related to type 2 immune responses whose cellular identity has been recently reevaluated to identify a new specialized t helper subset called th9 and an innate source referred as innate lymphoid cell type 2. over the past years, il-9 has been associated with allergic responses, tumor immunology, and autoimmunity; however, in this review, we will specifically focus on the role of il-9 and th9 cells in the context of parasitic infections. we will summarize and discuss all the evidence relating il-9 expression and function in parasitic infections with a particular emphasis in helminth infections, an important health issue in developing countries; we will also provide a general description and classification of parasites, the immune response and cellular compartments activated in this context, and its implications and future directions towards a complete understanding of this interesting new t helper subset and its potential therapeutic use.
machine_design	primary european car-makers agree on a 48 v embedded-supply to support the growing current-load requirements in modern vehicles. the functionalities required to the starter-generator are the engine start up, launch assistant torque, regenerative braking, battery charging and early fuel cut off. the dynamic load profile and the harsh environment working conditions make thermal issues the key challenge in the machine design. the paper presents the simulation and experimental test results of a belt driven starter-generator for 48 v mini hybrid powertrains. in particular, a double three-phase 10 kw induction machine has been selected as the suitable candidate for the application. in detail, the authors illustrate the experimental calibration and validation of the steady state thermal model, as well as the thermal characterization of a liquid cooled prototype. finally, the paper deals with the temperatures prediction of the motor working in different load conditions.
molecular_biology	background: contamination is a well-known but often neglected problem in molecular biology. here, we investigated the prevalence of cross-contamination among 446 samples from 116 distinct species of animals, which were processed in the same laboratory and subjected to subcontracted transcriptome sequencing. results: using cytochrome oxidase 1 as a barcode, we identified a minimum of 782 events of between-species contamination, with approximately 80% of our samples being affected. an analysis of laboratory metadata revealed a strong effect of the sequencing center: nearly all the detected events of between-species contamination involved species that were sent the same day to the same company. we introduce new methods to address the amount of within-species, between-individual contamination, and to correct for this problem when calling genotypes from base read counts. conclusions: we report evidence for pervasive within-species contamination in this data set, and show that classical population genomic statistics, such as synonymous diversity, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous diversity, inbreeding coefficient fit, and tajima 's d, are sensitive to this problem to various extents. control analyses suggest that our published results are probably robust to the problem of contamination. recommendations on how to prevent or avoid contamination in large-scale population genomics/molecular ecology are provided based on this analysis.
strength_of_materials	it is increasingly a requirement to be able to determine the mechanical properties of materials: (i) at the micro-scale, (ii) that are in the form of surface coatings and (iii) that have nanoscale microstructures. as a consequence micro-scale testing is an important tool that has been developed to aid the evaluation of the mechanical properties of such materials. in this work cantilever beam specimens (typically 2 mu m by 2 mu m by 10 mu m in size) have been prepared by gallium ion milling and then deformed in-situ within a fei helios dual beam workstation. the latter is achieved using a force probe with a geometry suitable for loading the micro-scale test specimens. thus force and displacement can be measured together with observing the deformation and fracture of the individual specimens. this paper considers the evaluation of the mechanical properties in particular elastic modulus, yield strength and fracture strength of materials that result in relatively large deflections to the micro-scale cantilever beams. two materials are considered the first is linear elastic single crystal silicon and the other elastic-plastic nanocrystalline (nc) nickel. the results are discussed with respect to the reproducibility of this method of mechanical testing and the evaluated properties are compared with those derived by alternative procedures.
southern_blotting	we report a case of the extremely rare condition epstein-barr virus (ebv)-positive t-cell lymphoproliferative disease (lpd) which occurred after umbilical cord blood transplantation. a 25-year-old japanese man underwent cord blood transplantation from a male human leukocyte antigen 4/6-matched donor due to acute myeloid leukemia with trisomy 8. bone marrow examination on day 30 showed chimerism with at least 90% donor cells and complete hematological response. chronic symptoms of graft-versus host disease appeared only on the skin and were successfully treated with cyclosporine alone. three years later, however, the patient experienced repeated cold-like symptoms and was hospitalized with liver dysfunction. a high fever developed and was followed by significant edema of the right side of the face. the ebv dna copy number in whole peripheral blood was 2x10(4)/ml. liver biopsy showed invasion of ebv-infected cd8-positive t cells. southern blotting analysis of the whole peripheral blood showed that the t-cell receptor c beta 1 rearrangement was positive. on the basis of these results, ebv-positive t-cell lpd was diagnosed and treated with prednisolone, cyclosporine, and etoposide, followed by cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. however, the patient died of cardiac function failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary hemorrhage, all of unidentified cause. most cases of ebv-related lpd after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation consist of ebv-positive b-cell lpd, and, to our knowledge, de novo ebv-positive t-cell lpd subsequent to transplantation has not been previously reported.
enzymology	in enzyme kinetics, the quasi-steady-state assumption (qssa) has been proposed for over 80 years, which plays a very important role in simplifying systems of equations derived from chemical reactions with enzymes. five years ago, we proved that the qssa is always true in the simplest model with the second elementary reaction irreversible, and called them as quasi-steady-state laws. thus, all conclusions based on qssa have a solid foundation in irreversible case. however, the chemical reactions are not always so simple in many life processes. the second elementary reaction should be reversible in general, and the irreversible case is actually only an approximation. so it is more important and interesting to study the reversible case, and it has already attracted enzymologists for a long time. the basic assumption, i.e. qssa in this general case has appeared in 1930. we proved this lasting over 80 years assumption in this paper.
enzymology	we report a microfluidic droplet-based approach enabling the measurement of chemical reactions of individual enzyme molecules and its application to a single-molecule-counting immunoassay. a microfluidic device is used to generate and manipulate <10 fl droplets at rates of up to 1.3 x 10(6) per second, about 2 orders of magnitude faster than has previously been reported. the femtodroplets produced with this device can be used to encapsulate single biomolecular complexes tagged with a reporter enzyme; their small volume enables the fluorescent product of a single enzyme molecule to be detected within 10 min of on-chip incubation. our prototype system is validated by detection of a biomarker for prostate cancer in buffer, down to a concentration of 46 fm. this work demonstrates a highly flexible and sensitive diagnostic platform that exploits extremely high-speed generation of monodisperse femtoliter droplets for the counting of individual analyte molecules.
enzymology	plants utilized for agricultural productions interact with insects, fungi, and bacteria under the field conditions, affecting thereby their productivity. since chitin and its derivatives play important roles in the interactions between these organisms, chitin-related enzymes are effective tools or drug targets for controlling the interactions. thus, the molecular biology, protein chemistry, and enzymology of the chitin-related enzymes have been intensively studied by many investigators. identifications and classifications of the genes encoding chitin synthetases, chitinases, chitosanases, and chitin deacetylases in these organisms were conducted, and their physiological functions were defined by knockdown, knockout, or overexpression of the corresponding genes. recombinant enzyme productions and mutation studies are also being conducted to understand their structure and function. all of these studies have opened the way to efficiently utilize these enzyme tools for enhancing the agricultural productions.
molecular_biology	measuring cell proliferation can be performed by a number of different methods, each with varying levels of sensitivity, reproducibility and compatibility with high-throughput formatting. this protocol describes the use of three different methods for measuring cell proliferation in vitro including conventional hemocytometer counting chamber, a luminescence-based assay that utilizes the change in the metabolic activity of viable cells as a measure of the relative number of cells, and a multi-mode cell imager that measures cell number using a counting algorithm. each method presents its own advantages and disadvantages for the measurement of cell proliferation, including time, cost and high-throughput compatibility. this protocol demonstrates that each method could accurately measure cell proliferation over time, and was sensitive to detect growth at differing cellular densities. additionally, measurement of cell proliferation using a cell imager was able to provide further information such as morphology, confluence and allowed for a continual monitoring of cell proliferation over time. in conclusion, each method is capable of measuring cell proliferation, but the chosen method is user-dependent.
polymerase_chain_reaction	multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and pcr protocols were developed and subsequently evaluated for its effectiveness in detecting simultaneously single and mixed infections in sheep and goats. specific primers for three dna viruses and three rna viruses, including foot and mouth disease virus (fmdv), bluetongue virus (btv), peste des petits ruminants virus (pprv), sheeppox virus (sppv), goatpox virus (gtpv) and orf virus (orfv) were used for testing procedure. a single nucleic acid extraction protocol was adopted for the simultaneous extraction of both rna and dna viruses. the multiplex pcr consisted with two-step procedure which included reverse transcription of rna virus and multiplex pcr of viral cdna and dna. the multiplex pcr assay was shown to be sensitive because it could detect at least 100 pg of viral genomic dna or rna from a mixture of six viruses in a reaction. the assay was also highly specific in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens. thirty seven clinical samples collected from sheep and goats were detected among forty three samples tested by both uniplex and multiplex pcr, showing highly identification. as results of the sensitivity and specificity, the multiplex pcr is a useful approach for clinical diagnosis of mixed infections of dna and rna viruses in sheep and goats with a reaction.

northern_blotting	antimicrobial peptides are important components of the host innate immune responses by exerting broad-spectrum microbicidal activity against pathogenic microbes. the first mollusk big defensin (designated aibd) cdna was cloned from bay scallop argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (est) and rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) techniques. the scallop aibd consisted of 531 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence aataaa and a poly(a) tail, encoding a polypeptide of 122 amino acids. the high similarity of aibd deduced amino acid sequence with big defensin from tachypleus tridentatus and branchiostoma belcheri tsingtaunese indicated that aibd should be a member of big defensin family. the expression of aibd in various tissues was measured by using northern blotting analysis. mrna transcripts of aibd could be detected in haemocytes of unchallenged scallops. the temporal expression of aibd in haemolymph after vibrio anguilarum challenge was recorded by quantitative real time pcr. the relative expression level of aibd in haemolymph was up-regulated evenly in the first 8 h, followed by a drastic increase, and increased 131.1-fold at 32 h post-injection. these results indicated that aibd could be induced by bacterial challenge, and it should participate in the immune responses of a. irradians. biological activity assay revealed that recombinant aibd could inhibit the growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and also showed strong fungicidal activity towards the expression host. recombinant expression of aibd made it possible to further characterize its functions involved in immune responses, and also provided a potential therapeutic agent for disease control in aquaculture.

polymerase_chain_reaction	alterations in mitochondrial respiration contribute to the development and progression of cancer via abnormal biogenesis, including generation of reactive oxygen species. ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (uqcrh) consists of the cytochrome bc1 complex serving respiration in mitochondria. in the present study, we analyzed uqcrh abnormalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and its association with clinical outcomes of patients. uqcrh expression in hcc was determined via semiquantitative and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of 96 surgically resected hcc tissues positive for hepatitis b virus surface antigen. uqcrh was frequently overexpressed in hcc tissues (46.8%, based on 2.1-fold cutoff). uqcrh overexpression was observed in hccs with larger tumor size, poorer differentiation, or vascular invasion. kaplan-meier analysis revealed significantly shorter overall (p=0.005) and recurrence-free survival (p=0.027) in patients with tumors overexpressing uqcrh. the prognostic impact of uqcrh was significant in subgroups of patients divided according to the -fetoprotein (afp) level. the patient subgroup with higher afp levels (20ng/ml) exhibited significant differences in 5-year overall (18.5% vs. 67.9%) and recurrence-free survival rates (11.1% vs. 46.4%) between groups with and without uqcrh overexpression. in contrast, no marked survival differences were observed between subgroups with lower afp levels (<20ng/ml). multivariate analysis defined uqcrh as an independent poor prognostic factor. conclusively, our results indicate that uqcrh overexpression is correlated with poor outcomes of hcc patients. furthermore, in patients grouped as high risk based on elevated afp, lack of uqcrh overexpression could be a useful indicator for clinical treatment.
molecular_biology	crispr-cas are self-/nonself-discriminating systems found in prokaryotic cells. they represent a remarkable example of molecular memory that is hereditarily transmitted. their discovery can be considered as one of the first fruits of the systematic exploration of prokaryotic genomes. although this genomic feature was serendipitously discovered in molecular biology studies, it was the availability of multiple complete genomes that shed light about their role as a genetic immune system. here we tell the story of how this discovery originated and was slowly and painstakingly advanced to the point of understating the biological role of what initially was just an odd genomic feature.
fluid_mechanics	the ammonothermal crystal growth technique is one of the most effective methods used for growing gallium nitride (gan) crystals in terms of the final product quality and manufacturing efficiency. popular applications of gan crystals include light emitting diodes (leds) and high-frequency electronic devices. a laterally-heated cylindrical enclosure with a top to bottom temperature gradient is considered in this study to investigate the fluid mechanics and heat transfer in an ammonothermal crystal growth reactor. three-dimensional (3d) large eddy simulations (les) results of natural convection in a laterally heated cylindrical reactor, using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (cfd) software, ansys fluent, are presented in this paper for a rayleigh number (ra) of 8.8 x 106. the ra is defined based on a length scale that is equal to the ratio of volume to the lateral area of the cylinder (r/2). in addition, an experiment of a geometrically- and dynamically-similar geometry is developed, and particle image velocimetry (piv)-based flow visualizations are carried out for the purpose of validating the numerical model. comparisons between experiments and numerical simulations showed that flow patterns were qualitatively similar, and fourier transforms of velocity magnitudes at selected points in the domain matched reasonably well. an added interesting observation in the simulation was the existence of temperature inversion, which has potential implications on the choice of mineralizer (acidic/basic).

human_metabolism	the anthropogenic heat emissions generated by human activities in london are analysed in detail for 20052008 and considered in context of long-term past and future trends (19702025). emissions from buildings, road traffic and human metabolism are finely resolved in space (30 min) and time (200 x 200 m2). software to compute and visualize the results is provided. the annual mean anthropogenic heat flux for greater london is 10.9 w m-2 for 20052008, with the highest peaks in the central activities zone (caz) associated with extensive service industry activities. towards the outskirts of the city, emissions from the domestic sector and road traffic dominate. anthropogenic heat is mostly emitted as sensible heat, with a latent heat fraction of 7.3% and a heat-to-wastewater fraction of 12%; the implications related to the use of evaporative cooling towers are briefly addressed. projections indicate a further increase of heat emissions within the caz in the next two decades related to further intensification of activities within this area. copyright (c) 2011 royal meteorological society
cell_biology	backgroundmass cytometry measures 36 or more markers per cell and is an appealing platform for comprehensive phenotyping of cells in human tissue and tumor biopsies. while tissue disaggregation and fluorescence cytometry protocols were pioneered decades ago, it is not known whether established protocols will be effective for mass cytometry and maintain cancer and stromal cell diversity. methodstissue preparation techniques were systematically compared for gliomas and melanomas, patient derived xenografts of small cell lung cancer, and tonsil tissue as a control. enzymes assessed included dnase, hyqtase, tryple, collagenase (col) ii, col iv, col v, and col xi. fluorescence and mass cytometry were used to track cell subset abundance following different enzyme combinations and treatment times. resultsmechanical disaggregation paired with enzymatic dissociation by col ii, col iv, col v, or col xi plus dnase for 1h produced the highest yield of viable cells per gram of tissue. longer dissociation times led to increasing cell death and disproportionate loss of cell subsets. key markers for establishing cell identity included cd45, cd3, cd4, cd8, cd19, cd64, hla-dr, cd11c, cd56, cd44, gfap, s100b, sox2, nestin, vimentin, cytokeratin, and cd31. mass and fluorescence cytometry identified comparable frequencies of cancer cell subsets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in glioma (r=0.97), and tonsil (r=0.98). conclusionsthis investigation establishes standard procedures for preparing viable single cell suspensions that preserve the cellular diversity of human tissue microenvironments.

immunology	subunit vaccines for prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection based on glycoprotein b (gb) and pp65 are in clinical trials, but it is unclear whether simultaneous vaccination with both antigens enhances protection. we undertook evaluation of a novel bivalent vaccine based on nonreplicating lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rlcmv) vectors expressing a cytoplasmic tail-deleted gb [gb(dct)] and full-length pp65 from human cmv in mice. immunization with the gb(dct) vector alone elicited a comparable gb-binding antibody response and a superior neutralizing response to that elicited by adjuvanted subunit gb. immunization with the pp65 vector alone elicited robust t cell responses. comparable immunogenicity of the combined gb(dct) and pp65 vectors with the individual monovalent formulations was demonstrated. to demonstrate proof of principle for a bivalent rlcmv-based hcmv vaccine, the congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (gpcmv) infection model was used to compare rlcmv vectors encoding homologs of pp65 (gp83) and gb(dct), alone and in combination versus freund 's adjuvanted recombinant gb. both vectors elicited significant immune responses, and no loss of gb immunogenicity was noted with the bivalent formulation. combined vaccination with rlcmv-vectored gpcmv gb(dct) and pp65 (gp83) conferred better protection against maternal viremia than subunit or either monovalent rlcmv vaccine. the bivalent vaccine also was significantly more effective in reducing pup mortality than the monovalent vaccines. in summary, bivalent vaccines with rlcmv vectors expressing gb and pp65 elicited potent humoral and cellular responses and conferred protection in the gpcmv model. further clinical trials of lcmv-vectored hcmv vaccines are warranted.
hydraulics	xylem embolism is one of the main processes involved in drought-related plant mortality. although its consequences for plant physiology are already well described, embolism formation and spread are poorly evaluated and modelled, especially for tracheid-based species. the aim of this study was to assess the embolism formation and spread in pinus sylvestris as a case study using x-ray microtomography and hydraulics methods. we also evaluated the potential effects of cavitation fatigue on vulnerability to embolism and the micro-morphology of the bordered pits using scanning electron microscopy (sem) to test for possible links between xylem anatomy and embolism spread. finally, a novel model was developed to simulate the spread of embolism in a 2d anisotropic cellular structure. results showed a large variability in the formation and spread of embolism within a ring despite no differences being observed in intertracheid pit membrane anatomical traits. simulations from the model showed a highly anisotropic tracheid-to-tracheid embolism spreading pattern, which confirms the major role of tracheid-to-tracheid air seeding to explain how embolism spreads in scots pine. the results also showed that prior embolism removal from the samples reduced the resistance to embolism of the xylem and could result in overestimates of vulnerability to embolism.
fluid_mechanics	the turbulent wake of a generic space launcher wind tunnel model with an underexpanded nozzle jet is investigated experimentally and numerically to gain insight into the variation of intricate wake flow phenomena of space vehicles at higher stages of the flight trajectory with increasing mach number. the experiments are carried out at m-infinity = 3 and m-infinity = 6 in the ludwieg tube test facility at the institute of fluid mechanics at the technische universitat braunschweig, while the corresponding time-resolved computations are performed by the institute of aerodynamics at rwth aachen university using a zonal rans-les approach. a strong alteration of the wake topology with increasing mach number due to the changing pressure ratio at the nozzle exit is found. at m-infinity = 3 the moderate underexpansion rate of p(e)/p(infinity) approximate to 5 leads to a formation of a recirculation region with an elongated triangular cross-section reaching to the nozzle exit. at m-infinity = 6 a substantially stronger afterexpansion of the jet plume (p(e)/p(infinity) approximate to 100) causes the formation of a cavity region with a quadrangular cross-section. the stronger deflection towards the nozzle at m-infinity = 3 results in lower mean and rms wall pressure ratios than at m-infinity = 6. however, due to the higher freestream pressure value at the lower mach number the relation of absolute values is reciprocal, making the lower supersonic regime more critical with respect to dynamic structural loads. this observation is confirmed by an overall good agreement between numerical and experimental data at characteristic positions on the base and nozzle wall. furthermore, it was shown that undesired effects of the strut support in the wake are present along the whole circumference. for m-infinity = 3 the strut influence is found to be particularly intense. the spectral analysis of wall pressure fluctuations reveals fundamental differences in the dynamic behavior of the two investigated wake flow regimes. at m-infinity = 3, a dominant frequency range around sr-d approximate to 0.2 associated with the inner dynamics of the recirculation bubble is found at the base, while on the nozzle a broad-band low-frequency content of substantially higher amplitudes is detected, which is a footprint of the graduate realignment of the turbulent shear layer along the nozzle wall. the spectra at m-infinity = 6 are characterized by several high-frequency sharp peaks at sr-d >= 0.8. a strong correlation between the supported wind tunnel configuration and the axisymmetric free-flight case is found for the peaks at sr-d approximate to 0.85 known to be caused by the radial flapping motion of the shear layer along the cavity.
computer-aided_design	there is a significant clinical need for engineered bone graft substitutes that can quickly, effectively, and safely repair large segmental bone defects. one emerging field of interest involves the growth of engineered bone tissue in vitro within bioreactors, the most promising of which are perfusion bioreactors. using bioreactor systems, tissue engineered bone constructs can be fabricated in vitro. however, these engineered constructs lack inherent vasculature and once implanted, quickly develop a necrotic core, where no nutrient exchange occurs. here, we utilized comsol modeling to predict oxygen diffusion gradients throughout aggregated alginate constructs, which allowed for the computer-aided design of printable vascular networks, compatible with any large tissue engineered construct cultured in a perfusion bioreactor. we investigated the effect of 3d printed macroscale vascular networks with various porosities on the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, using both gas-permeable, and non-gas permeable bioreactor growth chamber walls. through the use of 3d printed vascular structures in conjunction with a tubular perfusion system bioreactor, cell viability was found to increase by as much as 50% in the core of these constructs, with in silico modeling predicting construct viability at steady state.
hydraulics	ectomycorrhizal fungi have been reported to increase root hydraulic conductivity (l (pr)) by altering apoplastic and plasma membrane intrinsic protein (pip)-mediated cell-to-cell water transport pathways in associated roots, or to have little effect on root water transport, depending on the interacting species and imposed stresses. in this study, we investigated the water transport properties and pip transcription in roots of aspen (populus tremuloides) seedlings colonized by the wild-type strain of laccaria bicolor and by strains overexpressing a major fungal water-transporting aquaporin jq585595. inoculation of aspen seedlings with l. bicolor resulted in about 30 % colonization rate of root tips, which developed dense mantle and the hartig net that was restricted in the modified root epidermis. transcript abundance of the aspen aquaporins pip1;2, pip2;1, and pip2;2 decreased in colonized root tips. root colonization by jq585595-overexpressing strains had no significant impact on seedling shoot water potentials, gas exchange, or dry mass; however, it led to further decrease in transcript abundance of pip1;2 and pip2;3 and the significantly lower l (pr) than in non-inoculated roots. these results, taken together with our previous study that showed enhanced root water hydraulics of l. bicolor-colonized white spruce (picea glauca), suggest that the impact of l. bicolor on root hydraulics varies by the ectomycorrhiza-associated tree species.
northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are small, endogenous rnas that regulate gene expression in both plants and animals. a large number of mirnas has been identified from various animals and model plant species such as arabidopsis thaliana and rice (oryza sativa); however, characteristics of wheat (triticum aestivum) mirnas are poorly understood. here, computational identification of mirnas from wheat est sequences was preformed by using the in-house program genomicsvm, a prediction model for mirnas. this study resulted in the discovery of 79 mirna candidates. nine out of 22 mirna representatives randomly selected from the 79 candidates were experimentally validated with northern blotting, indicating that prediction accuracy is about 40%. for the 9 validated mirnas, 59 wheat ests were predicted as their putative targets.
human_metabolism	background age-related maculopathy (arm) or degeneration (armd) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries. despite several studies on the morphology of armd, the aetiology is unknown and factor(s) contributing to the pathogenesis remain to be characterised. more recent studies have demonstrated that cholesterol esters and lipids are present within bruch 's membrane deposits and drusen, and dietary fat intake is associated with armd. the product of ob gene, leptin, is a recently discovered peptide participating in human metabolism. there is a direct relationship between serum leptin and diet, and lipoprotein metabolism, but the role of leptin in the course of armd has not previously been investigated. purpose this cross-sectional case-control study investigated whether serum leptin level was associated with armd as a new possible risk factor and to assess its relationship with disease severity. methods a total of 32 patients with arm or armd (17 men, 15 women) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects without armd (11 men, nine women) from a similar ethnic background were enrolled in this multicentre study. body mass index (bmi) (weight (kg)/height (m(2))) was calculated for each group. the presence of maculopathy was assessed on the basis of colour fundus photographs using an international classification system. patients were classified as early-arm (n = 16) or late-armd (n = 16) using clinical examination and grading of photographs. serum leptin levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. the mann-whitney u test or chi(2) test was used for statistics as indicated, and p<0.05 was considered to be significant. results the age, sex ratio, and bmi between groups were comparable. patients with maculopathy had significantly (p<0.001) lower leptin levels (mean +/- sd, 6.01 +/- 2.55 ng/ ml) than control subjects (13.21+/- 2.27 ng/ml). in addition, late-armd patients had significantly lower leptin levels (3.81 +/- 0.58 ng/ ml) than early-arm patients (8.21 +/- 1.68 ng/ml, p<0.001) or control subjects (p<0.001). conclusion leptin seems to be a possible newly associated factor in the course of arm and may be involved in the lipid composition of the macular lesions, especially in late-armd.
immunology	background: reactions to rituximab occur frequently, with up to 77% of patients developing a reaction during initial exposure. the safety of rechallenging patients after a reaction is not clear and standard guidelines are lacking. objective: to better understand clinical decision making surrounding rituximab reactions and subsequent rechallenge. methods: we performed a 5-year retrospective review of all rituximab reactions at a large academic outpatient infusion center. patients' demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and management of reactions were reviewed. reaction severity was classified using standard criteria. results: between june 2006 and january 2011, 67 patients (mean age, 58 +/- 13 years, 54% men) with at least 1 rituximab reaction were identified. most reactions occurred during the first exposure to rituximab (63%). most reactions (n = 59 [88%]) were grade 1 or 2. fifty-one patients (n = 51 [88%]) were rechallenged with rituximab on the same day as the initial reaction. most patients with a grade 1 reaction tolerated rechallenge. conversely, all 4 patients with a grade 3 reaction had a reaction during rechallenge. the outcome of same-day rechallenge after an initial grade 2 reaction was varied; most patients (26 of 31 [84%]) tolerated same-day challenge, but 5 patients had a reaction (all grade 1-2 severity). conclusions: consistent with previous data, our observations suggest that patients who experience grade 1 reactions to rituximab can be safely rechallenged the same day. a grade 3 or 4 reaction should prompt referral to an allergy specialist for risk assessment before additional rituximab administration. further research is needed to understand the optimal management of patients with grade 2 reactions.

immunology	objective: phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes is decreased in healthy pregnancy and further decreased in preeclampsia. the cause of the declined function is unknown. decreased phagocyte function can lead to the higher infection rate in healthy pregnancy and may also be responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections and high trophoblast concentration in preeclampsia. the aim of this study is to examine the phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes. methods: monocytes and neutrophil granulocytes were separated from the peripheral circulation of six nonpregnant patients and incubated in plasma samples from six healthy pregnant, six preeclamptic pregnant, and six nonpregnant patients. the cells were marked and evaluated for the phagocytosis index with immunofluorescent microscope after phagocyting the zymosan molecules. results: phagocyte function of neutrophils as well as monocytes from nonpregnant patients were decreased significantly when the cells were incubated in plasma samples from healthy pregnant patients, and further decreased when incubated in plasma samples from preeclamptic pregnant women. conclusion: the decreased phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and that of monocytes in healthy pregnancy and the further decreased phagocyte function in preeclampsia is caused by factor(s) in the maternal circulation.
northern_blotting	organophosphorus ester-induced delayed neurotoxicity (opidn) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia progressing to paralysis with a concomitant central and peripheral distal axonapathy. diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (dfp) produces opidn in the chicken, which results in mild ataxia in 714 days and severe paralysis as the disease progresses with a single dose. white leghorn layer hens were treated with dfp (1.7 mg/kg, sc) after prophylactic treatment with atropine (i mg/kg, sc) in normal saline and eserine ( i mg/kg, so in dimethyl sulfoxide. control groups were treated with vehicle propylene glycol (0.1 ml/kg, sc), atropine in normal saline and eserine in dimethyl sulfoxide. the hens were sacrificed at different time points such as 2, 4, and 8 h, as well as 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 days, and the tissues from cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum brainstem and spinal cord were quickly dissected and frozen for protein (western) and mrna (northern) studies. subcellular fractionation, sds-page and immunoblotting of the nuclear and supernatant fractions using standard protocols from spinal cord and cerebrum showed differential expression of protein levels of pka, creb and phosphorylated creb (p-creb). there was an increase in pka level in spinal cord nuclear fraction after 4 h ( 130 +/- 5%) and 8 h (133 +/- 6%), while cerebrum nuclear fraction showed decrease (77 5%) at 4 h and remained at the same level at 8 h. no change was seen in either spinal cord or cerebrum soluble fraction at any time points. there was an increase in creb level in the spinal cord supernatant (133 +/- 3%) after 5 days, while nuclear and supernatant fraction of the cerebrum did not show any alterations at any time point. p-creb was induced in the spinal cord nuclear fraction at i day (150 3%) and 5 days (173 +/- 7%) of treatment, in contrast to the decreased levels p-creb (72 +/- 4%) at 10 days in cerebrum nuclear fraction. supernatant fraction of spinal cord and cerebrum did not show any changes in pcreb at time points studied. similarly another set of animals were treated with dfp and perfused using standard protocols and immunohistochemistry for p-creb in the brain and spinal cord confirmed the overall protein expression pattern identified by western analysis. expression of beta-tubulin subtypes (1, 2, 3, and 4), studied by northern blotting showed complex and differential pattern, while immunohistochemistry of the anti-beta-tubulin for the entire period of opidn developmental stages showed early induction and persistence even in the disintegrating axonal and non-neuronal structures of the cns. these data thus strongly suggest that early cytoskeletal damage at molecular level mediated by pka/p-creb pathways leads to the culmination of gross (microscopically observable) level cytoskeletal changes in various components of central nervous system (cns), consistent with our earlier findings. thus, the differential protein expression of pka, creb. p-creb and beta-tubulin subtypes appear to contribute to the initiation, progression and development of opidn, probably by recruiting other molecular pathways specific to various components of nervous system.

strength_of_materials	the elevated temperature performances of 2d70 al alloy hot extrusion rods after two-stage homogenization and intensive deformation were studied by measuring the elevated temperature enduring strength and the creep ultimate strength. the fracture morphology of some selected samples after testing at different elevated temperatures was observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results indicate that, as the test temperature increases, the elevated temperature enduring strength of 2d70 al alloy decreases gradually. in a comparison between 150a degrees c and 240a degrees c, the notch enduring strength drops from 375 to 185 mpa and the smooth enduring strength drops from 337 to 130 mpa. enduring strength is not sensitive to the notch. the notch sensitivity ratio (nsr) coefficient is in the range of 1.119 to 1.423 from 150a degrees c to 240a degrees c. the creep test results show that, as the test temperature increases from 150a degrees c to 240a degrees c, the creep ultimate strength of 2d70 al alloy rods drops gradually from 312 to 117 mpa.
enzymology	bacillus and related genera in the bacillales within the firmicutes harbor a variety of secondary metabolite gene clusters encoding polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases responsible for remarkable diverse number of polyketides (pks) and lipopeptides (lps). these compounds may be utilized for medical and agricultural applications. here, we summarize the knowledge on structural diversity and underlying gene clusters of lps and pks in the bacillales. moreover, we evaluate by using published prediction tools the potential metabolic capacity of these bacteria to produce type i pks or lps. the huge sequence repository of bacterial genomes and metagenomes provides the basis for such genome-mining to reveal the potential for novel structurally diverse secondary metabolites. the otherwise cumbersome task to isolate often unstable pks and deduce their structure can be streamlined. using web based prediction tools, we identified here several novel clusters of pks and lps from genomes deposited in the database. our analysis suggests that a substantial fraction of predicted lps and type i pks are uncharacterized, and their functions remain to be studied. known and predicted lps and pks occurred in the majority of the plant associated genera, predominantly in bacillus and paenibacillus. surprisingly, many genera from other environments contain no or few of such compounds indicating the role of these secondary metabolites in plant-associated niches.

enzymology	lipopolysaccharide (lps), which constitutes the lipid portion of the outer leaflet of gram-negative bacteria, is essential for growth. it is also responsible for the variety of biological effects associated with gram-negative sepsis. recent advances have elucidated the exact chemical structure of this highly complex macromolecule and much of the enzymology involved in its biosynthesis. enzymes involved in lps biogenesis are optimal targets for the development of novel therapeutics since they are sufficiently conserved among diverse, clinically-relevant bacteria and no analogue counterpart is present in humans. during the last thirty years a number of inhibitors of lps biosynthesis have been developed: some of these compounds have antibacterial properties, while others show excellent in vitro activity and are undergoing further investigation. the main focus of this review will be the biology of lps in bacteria summarizing the knowledge about structure and enzymatic catalysis, as well as chemical efforts towards the synthesis of inhibitors of the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of kdo, toward the minimal conserve structure kdo(2)-lipa. in addition, very recent advances in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of lps transport to the cell surface, as a new target to develop novel antibacterials, will be reported. future directions and perspectives will also be outlined.
immunology	introduction: the goal of replantation after dental avulsion is to maintain the tooth in its socket. presence of vital periodontal ligament cells on the root surface of the replanted tooth and the immunologic status of the patient are factors that protect against root resorption. it is known that dental constituents play an active role in root resorption by inducing specific and non-specific immune responses; however, little information exists regarding the influence of the acquired immune response on replantation. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the 5-year outcome of replantation in non-atopic and atopic patients. methods: clinical and radiographic examinations were performed in 62 replanted teeth during a 5-year period. the evaluation of atopy was based on the patients' personal and family histories and skin prick test results. the x-2 and the z tests were used to assess the association between atopy and the outcome of the replanted teeth (p < .05). results: there were significant differences between the 1-year and 5-year outcomes of the replanted teeth (p < .05) and atopic and non-atopic patients who had their teeth extracted because of inflammatory or replacement root resorption after 5 years (p < .05). conclusions: being atopic may offer the advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of replacement resorption, whereas being non-atopic may create an advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of inflammatory root resorption during the first 5 years after trauma.
strength_of_materials	shot peening is a surface process widely used to improve the fatigue strength of materials, through compressive residual stresses induced in their surface layers. considering mechanical components for high responsible applications, wear and corrosion control is currently accomplished by the use of coated materials. in the case of chrome plating or hard anodizing, lower fatigue strength in comparison to uncoated parts are associated to high residual tensile stresses and microcracks density. under constant or variable amplitude loading microcracks will propagate and cross the interface coating substrate without impediment. the aim of the present study is to analyze the influence of wc-10ni coating applied by hvof process on the axial fatigue strength of aisi 4340 steel. the shot peening effect on the fatigue performance of coated aisi 4340 steel was also evaluated. the fractured fatigue specimens were investigated using a scanning electron microscope in order to obtain information about the crack initiation points.

materials_engineering	in this paper we derive an approach for the effective utilization of thermodynamic data in phase-field simulations. while the most widely used methodology for multi-component alloys is following the work by eiken et al. (2006), wherein, an extrapolative scheme is utilized in conjunction with the tq interface for deriving the driving force for phase transformation, a corresponding simplistic method based on the formulation of a parabolic free-energy model incorporating all the thermodynamics has been laid out for binary alloys in the work by folch and plapp (2005). in the following, we extend this latter approach for multi-component alloys in the framework of the grand-potential formalism. the coupling is applied for the case of the binary eutectic solidification in the cr-ni alloy and two-phase solidification in the ternary eutectic alloy (al-cr-ni). a thermodynamic justification entails the basis of the formulation and places it in context of the bigger picture of integrated computational materials engineering.

immunology	immunization against human platelet alloantigens (hpas) is associated with a number of clinical complications. the detection and identification of clinically relevant platelet antibodies are important for the diagnosis and management of patients affected with immune-mediated thrombocytopenias. human platelet alloantigen frequencies and the characteristics of antiplatelet antibodies vary widely between ethnic groups. since 2008, the importance of platelet immunology in the field of transfusion medicine has gained greater recognition by clinical laboratories in china. laboratories in china have established and improved methods for platelet antibody detection and hpa genotyping techniques, which are used for the diagnosis of alloimmune platelet disorders in clinic and research environments. research has revealed the frequencies of hpa alleles in different chinese ethnic groups and compared the differences in hpa gene frequencies between the chinese han and other ethnic groups of the world. production of anti-cd36 isoantibodies is an important risk factor for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in the chinese population. advances in research and clinical application of platelet immunology have significantly improved the clinical diagnosis, treatment including transfusion support, and prevention of alloimmune platelet disorders in the chinese population.(c)2017 published by elsevier inc.
cell_biology	a fundamental question in cell biology, under investigation for over six decades, is the structural organization of mitochondrial cristae. long known to harbor electron transport chain proteins, crista membrane integrity is key to establishment of the proton gradient that drives oxidative phosphorylation. visualization of cristae morphology by electron microscopy/tomography has provided evidence that cristae are tube-like extensions of the mitochondria] inner membrane (im) that project into the matrix space. reconciling ultrastructural data with the lipid composition of the im provides support for a continuously curved cylindrical bilayer capped by a dome-shaped tip. strain imposed by the degree of curvature is relieved by an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in monolayer leaflets that comprise cristae membranes. the signature mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin (similar to 18% of im phospholipid mass), and phosphatidylethanolamine (34%) segregate to the negatively curved monolayer leaflet facing the crista lumen while the opposing, positively curved, matrix-facing monolayer leaflet contains predominantly phosphatidylcholine. associated with cristae are numerous proteins that function in distinctive ways to establish and/or maintain their lipid repertoire and structural integrity. by combining unique lipid components with a set of protein modulators, crista membranes adopt and maintain their characteristic morphological and functional properties. once established, cristae ultrastructure has a direct impact on oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, fusion/fission as well as diseases of compromised energy metabolism.

polymerase_chain_reaction	radiation treatment remains one of the major modalities in the treatment of lung cancer. although the majority of patients initially respond to treatment with radiation, resistance inevitably develops and leads to treatment failure. therefore, the identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms of radiation resistance may facilitate the development of novel approaches for overcoming resistance, and enhance the efficacy of treatment with radiation in lung and other types of cancer. in the present study we established three radiation-resistant sub-cell lines derived from the radiation-sensitive lung cancer cell line hcc827. using a polymerase chain reaction microrna (mirna) array, multiple mirnas were identified to be markedly downregulated in radiation-resistant cells, including mirna (mir)-124, mir-191 and mir-205. it was observed that overexpression of mir-124 sensitized the resistant cells to treatment with radiation and that thioredoxin reductase 1 (txnrd1) is a novel target of mir-124. furthermore, it was demonstrated that knockdown of txnrd1 using small interfering rna increased the basal level of reactive oxygen species and sensitized the cells to radiation treatment. the results of the present study demonstrated that multiple mirnas are downregulated in radiation-resistant lung cancer cells and that downregulation of mir-124 mediates radiation resistance through the targeting of txnrd1 mrna expression. the present study revealed a novel molecular mechanism of mirna-mediated radiation resistance and identified mir-124-regulated txnrd1 as a novel therapeutic target for overcoming radiation resistance in the treatment of lung cancer.
manufacturing_engineering	event sequences estimation is an important issue for fault diagnosis of discrete event systems, so far as fault events cannot directly be measured. this paper is about event sequences estimation with petri net models. events are assumed to be represented with transitions, and firing sequences are estimated from measurements of the marking variation. estimation with and without measurement errors are discussed in n-dimensional vector space over alphabet z(3) = {-1, 0, 1}. sufficient conditions and estimation algorithms are provided. performance is evaluated, and the efficiency of the approach is illustrated on two examples from manufacturing engineering.

computer-aided_design	scaling-up capabilities for the design, build, and test of synthetic biology constructs holds great promise for the development of new applications in fuels, chemical production, or cellular-behavior engineering. construct design is an essential component in this process; however, not every designed dna sequence can be readily manufactured, even using state-of-the-art dna synthesis methods. current biological computer-aided design and manufacture tools (biocad/cam) do not adequately consider the limitations of dna synthesis technologies when generating their outputs. designed sequences that violate dna synthesis constraints may require substantial sequence redesign or lead to price-premiums and temporal delays, which adversely impact the efficiency of the dna manufacturing process. we have developed a suite of build-optimization software tools (boost) to streamline the design build transition in synthetic biology engineering workflows. boost incorporates knowledge of dna synthesis success determinants into the design process to output ready-to-build sequences, preempting the need for sequence redesign. the boost web application is available at https://boost.jgi.doe.gov and its application program interfaces (api) enable integration into automated, customized dna design processes. the herein presented results highlight the effectiveness of boost in reducing dna synthesis costs and timelines.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: recent studies have demonstrated that netrin-1 plays a vital role in bone metabolism. previous studies have shown that osteoblasts produce netrin-1 which affects osteoclast differentiation. however, the role of netrin-1 in osteoblast differentiation is not well understood. in this study, we explored the roles of netrin-1 in osteoblasts. materials and methods: quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qpcr), rna interference for netrin receptors, the generation of netrin-1 plasmid, transfection of plasmids, and cell proliferation assay were performed. results: during osteoblast differentiation by ascorbic acid, netrin-1 expression was significantly decreased. gene expression related with osteoblast differentiation was down-regulated by netrin-1 treatment. we also found that osteoblast differentiation by bone morphogenetic protein-4 (bmp-4) was inhibited in the presence of recombinant netrin-1. forced expression of both bmp-4 and netrin-1 significantly decreased alkaline phosphatase expression. on the other hand, unc5b, neogenin, and a2b which belong to netrin receptors were expressed by osteoblasts. moreover, alkaline phosphatase expression was significantly decreased by knockdown for the combination of two receptors among these receptors. conclusion: netrin-1 is involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation.
fluid_mechanics	background three competing theories about the mechanism of mitral coaptation in normal subjects were evaluated by color doppler and vector flow mapping (vfm): (1) beginning of ventricular (lv) ejection, (2) ""breaking of the jet"" of diastolic lv inflow, and (3) returning diastolic vortices impacting the leaflets on their lv surfaces. methods and results we analyzed 80 color doppler frames and 320 vfm measurements. in all 20 normal subjects, coaptation occurred before lv ejection, 78 +/- 16 ms before onset. on color doppler frames the larger anterior, and smaller posterior vortices circle back and, in all cases, strike the ventricular surfaces of the leaflets. on the first closing-begins frame, for the first time, vortex velocity normal to the ventricular surface of the anterior leaflet (aml) is greater than that in the mitral orifice, and the angle of attack of lv vortical flow onto the aml is twice as high as the angle of flow onto the valve in orifice. thus, at the moment coaptation begins, vortical flow strikes the mitral leaflet with higher velocity, and higher angle of attack than orifice flow, and thus with greater force. according to the ""breaking of the jet"" theory, one would expect to see de novo lv flow perpendicular to the leaflets beginning after transmitral flow terminates. instead, the returning continuous lv vortical flow that impacts the valve builds continuously after the p-wave. conclusions late diastolic vortices strike the ventricular surfaces of the mitral leaflets and contribute to valve coaptation, permitted by concomitant decline in transmitral flow.
machine_design	in this work an ultrasound-based measurement method is used for monitoring suspension velocity and build-up of magnetic material inside a wet low-intensity magnetic separator, a process used e.g. in beneficiation of magnetite ores. today the only available option is to monitor material transport between unit operations; i.e. flow rate, solids concentration, and particle size distribution of suspension flow in pipes are measured online using standard equipment. an acoustic backscatter system is fitted to the tank of a separator, and used to monitor the internal flow. a method called ultrasonic velocity profiling is used to capture internal velocity profiles. simultaneously, the backscatter signal intensity is used to get indications about local solids concentration of the flow, and build-up of magnetic material. the methods are evaluated in realistic conditions, where the effect of varying factors relevant to machine performance is investigated. the included factors are; the slurry feed rate, the slurry solids concentration, the magnet assembly angle, and the drum rotational speed. the presented method gives useful information about the internal material flow inside the separator. the velocity measurements capture the, sometimes complex, internal flow patterns, for example the presence and velocity of a recirculating flow in the dewatering zone. additionally, keeping a balanced material loading in the concentrate dewatering zone is important to separator performance. using the signal backscatter intensity it is possible to qualitatively monitor this material loading. generally these direct measurements can aid in improvements to machine design, process optimization, and process control.

northern_blotting	laminin (lm) alpha 4 chain, a constituent of lm-411 and lm-421, is mainly localized to mesenchyme-derived tissues, and is suggested to have a role in formation and function of endothelium, transmigration of inflammatory cells through endothelium, and invasion of certain tumors. in this study, we evaluated the distribution of alpha 4 chain lms in 33 conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinomas (rccs) (31 primary tumors, two metastases), two papillary rccs, and two oncocytomas by immunohistochemistry. in all tumors, immunoreactivity for lm alpha 4 chain was found in vasculature and stroma. basement membranes were detected around tumor cell islets in 34/37 tumors. they showed immunoreactivity for lm alpha 4 chain in 28/34 cases. northern blotting, inhibition of protein secretion with monensin, and immunoprecipitation combined with western blotting showed that caki-2, achn, and caki-1 renal carcinoma cell lines produce alpha 4 chain lms. in cell adhesion assay, recombinant human lm-411 did not promote adhesion of renal carcinoma cells but inhibited adhesion to fibronectin (fn). in cell migration assay, the cells migrated more on lm-411 than on fn. the results suggest that alpha 4 chain lms have a de- adhesive function and could thus play a role in detachment, migration and invasion of renal carcinoma cells in vivo.
enzymology	background: proteins that 'read' the histone code are central elements in epigenetic control and bromodomains, which bind acetyl-lysine motifs, are increasingly recognized as potential mediators of disease states. notably, the first bet bromodomain-based therapies have entered clinical trials and there is a broad interest in dissecting the therapeutic relevance of other bromodomain-containing proteins in human disease. typically, drug development is facilitated and expedited by high-throughput screening, where assays need to be sensitive, robust, cost-effective and scalable. however, for bromodomains, which lack catalytic activity that otherwise can be monitored (using classical enzymology), the development of cell-based, drug-target engagement assays has been challenging. consequently, cell biochemical assays have lagged behind compared to other protein families (e.g., histone deacetylases and methyltransferases). results: here, we present a suite of novel chromatin and histone-binding assays using alphalisa, in situ cell extraction and fluorescence-based, high-content imaging. first, using trim24 as an example, the homogenous, bead-based alphascreen technology was modified from a biochemical peptide-competition assay to measure binding of the trim24 bromodomain to endogenous histone h3 in cells (alphalisa). second, a target agnostic, high-throughput imaging platform was developed to quantify the ability of chemical probes to dissociate endogenous proteins from chromatin/nuclear structures. while overall nuclear morphology is maintained, the procedure extracts soluble, non-chromatin-bound proteins from cells with drug-target displacement visualized by immunofluorescence (if) or microscopy of fluorescent proteins. pharmacological evaluation of these assays cross-validated their utility, sensitivity and robustness. finally, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we dissect domain contribution of trim24, brd4, atad2 and smarca2 to chromatin binding illustrating the versatility/utility of the in situ cell extraction platform. conclusions: in summary, we have developed two novel complementary and cell-based drug-target engagement assays, expanding the repertoire of pharmacodynamic assays for bromodomain tool compound development. these assays have been validated through a successful trim24 bromodomain inhibitor program, where a micromolar lead molecule (iacs-6558) was optimized using cell-based assays to yield the first single-digit nanomolar trim24 inhibitor (iacs-9571). altogether, the assay platforms described herein are poised to accelerate the discovery and development of novel chemical probes to deliver on the promise of epigenetic-based therapies.
genetics	in cms (cytoplasmic male sterility)-based hybrid rye (secale cereale l.) breeding, effective pollen-fertility restoration is an essential prerequisite for achieving maximum grain yield on the one hand and for minimizing ergot (claviceps purpurea) infestation on the other. restorer genes for the cms-inducing 'pampa' cytoplasm derived from landraces collected in iran and argentina are used by breeders for achieving this goal. here, restorer genes from four germplasm sources ('altevogt 14160', 'iran iii', 'trenelense' and 'pico gentario') were analysed by producing three-way cross hybrids between an elite cms single cross and pollinators with and without a given restorer gene. materials were evaluated on large drilled plots for restorer index (ri), grain yield, plant height and other traits in six environments. in experiment 1, a restorer gene from 'altevogt 14160' was used. seven pairs of marker-selected carrier and non-carrier backcross lines served as pollinators. in experiment 2, the pollinators were 17 backcross line pairs from the other three germplasm sources. these lines were grouped as high (ri >67%) and low restorers (ri < 30%), respectively, using testcrosses with a highly diagnostic cms tester. hybrids carrying an exotic restorer gene suffered from a significant grain yield reduction by 4.4% and 9.4% and were 9.3 and 4.8cm taller in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. thousand-kernel weight was reduced, whereas quality traits were only slightly affected. for all traits, significant genetic variance existed among the testcrosses to the presence vs. absence of a given exotic restorer gene. this offers a chance for the breeder to reduce or ultimately overcome the presently observed performance reductions brought about by exotic restorer genes.

immunology	the development of methods for the detection of aflatoxin bi (afb(1)) in foods is a very important practice for ensuring food quality and safety. most tests of afb(1) are still conducted with conventional methods (i.e. antibody-based elisa tests, high performance liquid chromatography hplc); however biosensor methods are being developed to date as screening tools for 'field analysis. compared to immunology/elisa-like tests or chromatography methods, biosensors are able to provide rapid, sensitive, robust and cost effective quantitative methods for on-site testing. in this work we propose a cellular biosensor based on vero cells, membrane engineered with anti-afb1 antibody as the biological recognition element reacting with afbi molecules on gold nanoparticle/screen printed electrodes (spes) (three electrode system). in order to culture the cells on the spes surfaces the working electrodes were coated with poly l-lysine to facilitate cell adhesion. the spes were connected to a potentiostat device through a transducer and chronoamperometric (ca) and cyclic voltammetric (cv) measurements were performed. quantitative results obtained using the cellular biosensor method for afb(1) were compared to those obtained using the hplc method in pistachio samples spiked with afb(1). the method displayed good sensitivity (r(2) = 0.87) and detection limit (0.5 ng/ml).

computer-aided_design	digital technology has been widely used in the field of implant dentistry. from a surgical standpoint, computer-guided surgery can be utilized to enhance primary implant stability and to improve the precision of implant placement. from a prosthetic standpoint, computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (cad/cam) technology has brought about various restorative options, including the fabrication of customized abutments through a virtual design based on computer-guided surgical planning. this case report describes a novel technique combining the use of a three-dimensional (3d) printed surgical template for the immediate placement of an implant, with cad/cam technology to optimize hard and soft tissue healing after bone grafting with the use of a socket sealing abutment.
hydraulics	manning 's empirical formula in conjunction with strickler 's scaling is widely used to predict the hulk velocity v from the hydraulic radius rh, the roughness size r and the slope of the energy grade line s in uniform channel and pipe flows at high bulk reynolds numbers. despite their importance in science and engineering, both manning 's and strickler 's formulations have waited for decades before finding a theoretical explanation. this was provided, for the first time, by gioia & bombardelli (phys. rev. lett., vol. 88, 2002. 014501), labelled as gb02, using phenomenological arguments. perhaps their most remarkable finding was the link between the strickler and the kolmogorov scaling exponents, the latter pertaining to velocity fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the turbulence spectrum and presumed to he universal. in this work, the gb02 analysis is first revisited, showing that gb02 employed several ad hoc scaling assumptions for the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and, although implicitly, for the mean velocity gradient adjacent to the roughness elements. the similarity constants arising from the gb02 scaling assumptions were presumed to he independent of r/r-h, which is inconsistent with well-known flow properties in the near-wall region of turbulent wall flows. because of the dependence of these similarity constants on r/r-h, this existing theory requires the validity of the strickler scaling to cancel the dependence of these constants on rirh so as to arrive at the strickler scaling and manning 's formula. here, the gb02 approach is corroborated using a co-spectral budget (csb) model for the wall shear stress formulated at the cross-over between the roughness sublayer and the log region. assuming a simplified shape for the spectrum of the vertical velocity w, the proposed csb model (subject to another simplifying assumption that production is balanced by pressure velocity interaction) allows manning 's formula to be derived. to substantiate this approach, numerical solutions to the csb over the entire flow depth using different spectral shapes for w are carried out for a wide range of r/r-h. the results from this analysis support the simplifying hypotheses used to derive manning 's equation. the derived equation provides a formulation for n that agrees with reported values in the literature over seven decades of r variations. while none of the investigated spectral shapes allows the recovery of the strickler scaling, the numerical solutions of the csb reproduce the nikuradse data in the fully rough regime, thereby confirming that the strickler scaling represents only an approximate fit for the friction factor for granular roughness.
computer-aided_design	the effect of a triple metal-gate (tmg) on the performance and on the ambipolar current in a tmg vertical tunnel field-effect transistor with triple metal-gate (tmg-tfet) is investigated using technology computer-aided design simulation. the tmg-tfet is designed to tackle the performance as well as the ambipolar current, simultaneously, by modulating the tmg parameters-the work function of the tmg and/or the length of each mg-that have critical impacts on the energy-band diagrams of the channel region. the tempered on-/off-current ratio of 10(8) and the steep average subthreshold slope of 43.5 mv/decade at a power supply voltage of 0.5 v are ascribed to the formation of an energy barrier in the channel by the optimal device parameters. it is found that two main flaws in a conventional (single-material gate) tfet, which are the degraded on-state current and the ambipolar current, can be successfully controlled by adjusting the tmg structure.
genetics	as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) begins to replicate within hosts, immune responses are elicited against it. escape mutations in viral epitopes immunogenic peptide parts presented on the surface of infected cells allow hiv to partially evade these responses, and thus rapidly go to fixation. the faster they go to fixation, i.e., the higher their escape rate, the larger the selective pressure exerted by the immune system is assumed to be. this relation underpins the rationale for using escapes to assess the strength of immune responses. however, escape rate estimates are often obtained by employing an aggregation procedure, where several mutations that affect the same epitope are aggregated into a single, composite epitope mutation. the aggregation procedure thus rests upon the assumption that all within-epitope mutations have indistinguishable effects on immune recognition. in this study, we investigate how violation of this assumption affects escape rate estimates. to this end, we extend a previously developed simulation model of hiv that accounts for mutation, selection, and recombination to include different distributions of fitness effects (dfes) and inter mutational genomic distances. we use this discrete time wright fisher based model to simulate early within-host evolution of hiv for dfes and apply standard estimation methods to infer the escape rates. we then compare true with estimated escape rate values. we also compare escape rate values obtained by applying the aggregation procedure with values estimated without use of that procedure. we find that across the dfes analyzed, the aggregation procedure alters the detectability of escape mutations: large-effect mutations are overrepresented while small-effect mutations are concealed. the effect of the aggregation procedure is similar to extracting the largest-effect mutation appearing within an epitope. furthermore, the more pronounced the over-exponential decay of the dfes, the more severely true escape rates are underestimated. we conclude that the aggregation procedure has two main consequences. on the one hand, it leads to a misrepresentation of the dfe of fixed mutations. on the other hand, it conceals within-epitope interactions that may generate irregularities in mutation frequency trajectories that are thus left unexplained.
internal_combustion_engine	hydrogen is a promising energy carrier, and the port fuel injection (pfi) is a fuel-flexible, durable, and relatively cheap method of energy conversion. however, combustion knock as an abnormal combustion phenomenon does not only limit the brake torque and thermal efficiency, but also breaks the piston or engines. this paper uses a four-stoke cycle, displacement of 2.0 l pfi hydrogen internal combustion engine and a calculated model to study the inducing factors and frequency of combustion knock. results showed that combustion knock occurs at relatively higher engine speed (more than 3000 r/min) than the engine speed occurring knock of gasoline engine. the calculated average temperatures of air fuel mixture at the end of combustion using thermodynamics dual zone model fall in the range of 1000-1100 k for hydrogen engines, which are higher than gasoline ones (about 200 k). knock and the other abnormal combustion phenomena (backfire and pre-ignite) interact with each other. when the backfire generates, the components in the cylinder will be heated. in the next cycle, the components of the cylinder will release heat to the intake, which can increase the initial temperature at ignition. the high initial temperature will lead to the combustion knock. otherwise, because of the combustion knock, the temperatures of cylinder components will increase, which generates hot spots and ultimately causes pre-ignite and backfire. through the figures of fast fourier transform (fft) amplitude, the frequency of hydrogen engines is higher than gasoline ones for every kind of mode. the pressure waves of combustion knock spread with radial direction for light combustion knock and with circumferential direction for heavy combustion knock. these conclusions can be used to explore the working conditions close to combustion knock to achieve higher thermal efficiency and provide a guidance to detect the knock in hydrogen engine.

computer-aided_design	we investigate the electrical characteristics according to changing temperature on trap distribution in the energy gap of grain boundary (gb) and interface trap density (d-it) between polycrystalline-silicon (poly-si) channel and tunnel oxide in vertical nand (vnand) flash cell with poly-si channel. we confirmed that there are two factors changing gb potential barrier height such as trap distribution in gb and dit using technology computer-aided design (tcad) simulation. also, we found that the electrical characteristics according to changing temperature are significantly dependent on height and position of gb potential barrier in vnand flash cell with poly-si channel. we expect that it is required to develop more accurate extraction method for trap distribution in each gb and dit for better understanding temperature dependence of electrical characteristics in vnand flash cell.
molecular_biology	in the early 1980 's, the dispute on the existence of a multiplicity of receptors for neurotransmitter was at its height. several subtypes of serotonin (5-ht) receptors were proposed on the basis of radioligand binding assays. in order to provide further support to the existence of these receptors we performed quantitative autoradiographic mapping of the binding of several ligands for the 5-ht1 receptor labeling the subtypes 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b and 5-ht1c, and characterized pharmacologically these different receptors. the results demonstrated differential localization of the subtypes of 5-ht1 receptors indicating that they were expressed by different cell populations, probably neurons, in the brain and further supporting their reality. shortly afterwards, the cloning of the genes coding for these 5-ht receptors, and many others, ended the dispute by demonstrating that they were different proteins. the advent of molecular biology provided new methodologies for the study of the chemical and molecular anatomy of 5-ht receptors in brain, by visualizing cells expressing their mrna by in situ hybridization and showed that the family of mammalian 5-ht receptors has 14 members, a figure much larger than ever suspected at that time. this article is part of a special issue entitled si:50th anniversary issue.

southern_blotting	t alpha i (thymosin alpha i), an immune booster, plays an important role in the maturation, differentiation and function of t-cells. it can also activate the production of cytokines in dendritic cells. tal is one of two thymosin proteins that have potential future clinical applications. in order to express t alpha i protein in plants, we designed and synthesized the t alpha i gene according to the plant codon usage bias and created a novel 4 x t alpha i concatemer (four copies of the t alpha i gene arranged end-to-end in tandem, designated 4 x t alpha i). subsequently, a plant binary expression vector, pg-prd 12-4 x t alpha i, was constructed and introduced into tomato via agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. through selection, 54 regenerated tomato plants resistant to kanamycin were obtained, and four transgenic tomato plants were further confirmed by pcr and southern blotting. rt-pcr (reverse transcription-pcr) analysis showed that the 4 x t alpha i gene was transcribed specifically in tomato [solanum lycopersicum (formerly lycopersicon esculentum)] fruits. elisa analysis showed that the content of the 4 x tot i protein reached a maximum of 6.098 mu g/g fresh weight in mature tomato fruit. western-blot analysis further confirmed the expression of 4 x t alpha i protein in transgenic tomato fruits. the mtt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide] assay showed the 4 x t alpha i protein derived from transgenic tomatoes exhibited bioactivity that can stimulate the proliferation of mice splenic lymphocytes in vitro, and the specific activity of t alpha i protein from the artificial system was higher than that from the synthetic escherichia coli system. this study is the first to report successful expression of bioactive t alpha i in plants, and also it will provide the basis for furl ther development of the plant system to produce t alpha i.
machine_design	since earlier days, most of the failures encountered by the structures or machines are mainly due to material fatigue. the dynamic behaviour of the beam may change when cracks begin to appear in it. knowledge of these changes in the dynamic individualism is important in crack detection as well as in structure or in machine design. this paper deals with systematic study on the free vibration of euler-bernoulli beam containing open edge transverse cracks. in this study, two springs steel materials (en 8 and en 47) are considered. the effect of the top side cracks and bottom side cracks on the natural frequency of a cantilever beam is discussed. the natural frequency of a cracked case cantilever beam is investigated numerically using fe analysis software ansys. experimental work is done by using dewefrf to investigate the natural frequency of cracked beams for strong validation of the numerical results. the results of this study suggest that the average value of natural frequencies for all top side cracked beams are identical to the average value of natural frequency for all bottom side cracked beams. this is true for both en 47 and en 8. hence, it is clear that the dynamic characteristic (natural frequency) is not changing, when same configuration of cracks is either on top or bottom side of the beam. the natural frequencies for en 8 material are comparatively on higher side than en 47 material for the same crack configurations. in most of the cracked cases, the damping effect of en 47 is greater than en 8. it is also found that as crack location increases at constant crack depth, then natural frequency increases. at the last location, as crack depth increases, natural frequencies almost remain same. it is observed that, the presence of top side crack and bottom side crack of the same configuration in the cantilever beam is not a function of natural frequency, when cantilever beam is of a square cross section.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: obesity is genetically heterogeneous and highly heritable, although polymorphisms explain the phenotype in only a small proportion of obese children. we investigated the presence of copy number variations (cnvs) in ""classical"" genes known to be associated with (monogenic) early-onset obesity in children. methods: in 194 obese caucasian children selected for early-onset and severe obesity from our obesity cohort we screened for deletions and/or duplications by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification reaction (mlpa). as we found one mlpa probe to interfere with a polymorphism in sim1 we investigated its association with obesity and other phenotypic traits in our extended cohort of 2305 children. results: in the selected subset of most severely obese children, we did not find cnv with mlpa in pomc, lep, lepr, mc4r, mc3r or mc2r genes. however, one sim1 probe located at exon 9 gave signals suggestive for sim1 insufficiency in 52 patients. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis identified this as a false positive result due to interference with single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) rs3734354/rs3734355. we, therefore, investigated for associations of this polymorphism with obesity and metabolic traits in our extended cohort. we found rs3734354/rs3734355 to be associated with body mass index-standard deviation score (bmi-sds) (p = 0.003), but not with parameters of insulin metabolism, blood pressure or food intake. conclusions: in our modest sample of severely obese children, we were unable to find cnvs in well-established monogenic obesity genes. nevertheless, we found an association of rs3734354 in sim1 with obesity of earlyonset type in children, although not with obesity-related traits.
hydraulics	whitewater parks (wwps) are increasingly popular recreational amenities, but the effects of wwps on fish habitat and passage are poorly understood. this study investigated the use of a two-dimensional (2-d) model as compared with a three-dimensional (3-d) hydrodynamic model (flow-3d((r))) for assessing effects of wwps on fish habitat. the primary aims of this study were to (1) examine the utility of 3-d modelling versus 2-d modelling in a hydraulically complex wwp and (2) compare modelled habitat quality for resident fishes with actual fish abundance and biomass generated from field sampling surveys. two reaches of a wadeable river in colorado were modelled: a natural reach and a reach containing a wwp. a 2-d habitat suitability analysis for juvenile and adult brown trout, juvenile and adult rainbow trout, longnose dace and longnose sucker predicted the same or higher habitat quality in the wwps than the natural pools for all four species and for all modelled flow rates; however, results from fish sampling found significantly higher fish biomass for all four species in natural pools compared with wwp pools. all hydraulic metrics (depth, depth-averaged velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, 2-d and 3-d vorticity) had higher magnitudes in wwp pools than in natural pools. in the wwp pools, 3-d model results described the spatial distribution of flow characteristics or the magnitude of variables better than 2-d results. this supports the use of 3-d modelling for complex flows found in wwps, but improved understanding of linkages between fish habitat quality and 3-d hydraulic descriptors is needed. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
polymerase_chain_reaction	1. several eel species have undergone extensive declines at both local and global level. the aim of this study was to identify the reasons for the collapse of the european eel (anguilla anguilla) stock in an important area for biodiversity conservation (comacchio lagoon, italy), in order to support the development of eel conservation plans. 2. the records of silver eel catches from comacchio describe the total migratory population and cover the period 1781- 2013. the data are accompanied by information related to habitat loss and other local factors. the role of local factors on the decline of the local stock was investigated, while additional information from the literature was also used to discuss the effects of global factors (including glass eel harvest for aquaculture, climateoceanographic changes, habitat loss, pollution and parasitism) on the three eel species a. anguilla, anguilla japonica and anguilla rostrata. 3. the records from comacchio provided significant information about the effects of local factors on the local eel populations in the past. however, the current population collapse, which started in the 1970s, could not be explained by local factors. 4. the literature on global factors suggests that the three eel species are under combined threat from various factors. the correlations between european aquaculture production data compared with the comacchio yields and published data from other european eel and glass eel fisheries were found to be highly significant. aquaculture, which depends entirely on wild- caught glass eels, seems to play a key role in the decline of natural stocks. 5. conservative estimates using fao data showed that the current numbers of glass eels needed to support aquaculture production in europe and asia exceeds 2 x 109 specimens. this requirement, largely supplied by a. anguilla glass eels, can explain the decline of eel populations since the glass eel trade has been expanded at an international level. copyright # 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
internal_combustion_engine	purpose - this paper aims to present experimental results of gasoline-fuelled engine operation of a crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engine used for unmanned air vehicle (uav)/unmanned air system application and to cross correlate with computational fluid dynamic modelling results. design/methodology/approach - computational modelling of the engine system was conducted using the wave software supported by the experimental research and development via dynamometer testing of a spark ignition uav engine to construct a validated computational model exploring a range of fuel delivery options. findings - experimental test data and computational simulation have allowed an assessment of the potential advantages of applying direct in-cylinder fuel injection. practical implications - the ability to increase system efficiency offers significant advantages in terms of maximising limited resources and extending mission duration capabilities. the computational simulation and validation via experimental test experience provides a means of assessment of possibilities that are costly to explore experimentally and offers added confidence to be able to investigate possibilities for the development of similar future engine designs. originality/value - the software code used has not been applied to such crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engines and provides a valuable facility for further simulation of the twin cylinder horizontally opposed design to offer further system optimisation and exploration of future possibilities.
human_metabolism	development in the rapidly growing urban areas can influence local climate. this micro-climate change may affect the surrounding environment, including schools. however, the study of comfort in teaching and learning environment is very limited, especially for schools. thermal comfort is defined as ""that condition of mind, which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment"" (iso standard 7730 in 1994). thermal comfort is affected by heat, convection heat, radiation and absorption of heat loss (evaporative heat loss) and retained the heat produced by the human metabolism can be removed. this will maintain thermal equilibrium with the environment. any gains or losses outside this range, the heat will cause discomfort. many studies conducted shows thermal comfort can influence occupants in it. several studies have shown lately that the international comfort standards for buildings and the related predictions models report a warmer sensation than the occupants report in the case of naturally ventilated buildings in warm climates. this paper exposes some aspects of the debate in the field of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings located in warm and humid climates. this paper reports on the findings of a preliminary survey conducted to identify and investigate the students' perceptions towards classroom thermal comfort and the schools' surrounding using the teaching and learning classroom thermal comfort inventory (tltci) instrument. the results show that the surveyed students have high level of awareness regarding the climate change and also they find that their teaching and learning classroom thermal comfort is at a comfortable level.

computer-aided_design	this study aims to investigate the influence of different neck structures on implant stress distribution. a computer-aided design (cad) mandibular model based on adult mandibular computed tomography (ct) information was first established, and then used to create a mandibular model and a related mandibular implant model by using solidworks. the implant was then fitted to the mandibular first molar. four neck-type implants, i.e., uniform-threaded implant (ut), wide-neck implant (wn), implant with single-microthreaded neck (smn), and implant with double-microthreaded neck (dmn), received axial 100-n, horizontal 50-n, and oblique 100-n loads, by using the ansys workbench software; the von mises equivalent stress (es) and maximum principal stress (mps) in different implant groups were then compared. axial 100-n load: the maximum es in the cortical bone area (cb-mes, mpa) was 46.58, 35.25, 20.98, and 58.01 in ut, wn, smn, and dmn respectively; the mps at the superior edge of cortical bone (cb-mps, mpa) was 0.97, 0.89, 0.79, and 1.22 in the same four groups respectively. horizontal 50-n load: cb-mes was 53.21, 41.93, 36.95, and 64.18 in ut, wn, smn, and dmn respectively; cb-mps was 41.77, 39.61, 29.67, and 46.99 in the same four groups respectively. oblique 100-n load: cb-mes was 49.37, 47.78, 34.02, and 78.52 in ut, wn, smn, and dmn respectively; cb-mps was 29.35, 21.28, 15.34, and 34.69 in the same four groups respectively. cb-mes and cb-mps of smn were the smallest.
immunology	bacterial biofilms frequently form on fungal surfaces and can be involved in numerous bacterial-fungal interaction processes, such as metabolic cooperation, competition, or predation. the study of biofilms is important in many biological fields, including environmental science, food production, and medicine. however, few studies have focused on such bacterial biofilms, partially due to the difficulty of investigating them. most of the methods for qualitative and quantitative biofilm analyses described in the literature are only suitable for biofilms forming on abiotic surfaces or on homogeneous and thin biotic surfaces, such as a monolayer of epithelial cells. while laser scanning confocal microscopy (lscm) is often used to analyze in situ and in vivo biofilms, this technology becomes very challenging when applied to bacterial biofilms on fungal hyphae, due to the thickness and the three dimensions of the hyphal networks. to overcome this shortcoming, we developed a protocol combining microscopy with a method to limit the accumulation of hyphal layers in fungal colonies. using this method, we were able to investigate the development of bacterial biofilms on fungal hyphae at multiple scales using both lscm and scanning electron microscopy (sem). this report describes the protocol, including microorganism cultures, bacterial biofilm formation conditions, biofilm staining, and lscm and sem visualizations.
cell_biology	objectives/hypothesiscurrent interventions in the management of vocal fold (vf) dysfunction focus on conservative and surgical approaches. however, the complex structure and precise biomechanical properties of the human vf mean that these strategies have their limitations in clinical practice and in some cases offer inadequate levels of success. regenerative medicine is an exciting development in this field and has the potential to further enhance vf recovery beyond conventional treatments. our aim in this review is to discuss advances in the field of regenerative medicine; that is, advances in the process of replacing, engineering, or regenerating the vf through utilization of stem cells, with the intention of restoring normal vf structure and function. data sourcesenglish literature (1946-2015) review. methodswe conducted a systematic review of medline for cases and studies of vf tissue engineering utilizing stem cells. resultsthe three main approaches by which regenerative medicine is currently applied to vf regeneration include cell therapy, scaffold development, and utilization of growth factors. conclusionexciting advances have been made in stem cell biology in recent years, including use of induced pluripotent stem cells. we expect such advances to be translated into the field in the forthcoming years. laryngoscope, 126:1865-1870, 2016
fluid_mechanics	under the design conditions of a research reactor, the siphon phenomenon induced by pipe rupture can cause continuous efflux of water. in order to prevent water efflux, an additional facility is necessary. a siphon breaker is a type of safety facility that can resist the loss of coolant effectively. however, analysis of siphon breaking is complex since it comprises two-phase flow and there are many inputs to be considered. for this reason, in order to facilitate the analysis and design of the siphon breaker, a simulation program based on fluid mechanics was developed using mfc (microsoft foundation class) programming. from bernoulli 's equation, the velocity and quantity as well as undershooting height, water level, pressure, friction coefficient, and factors related to the two-phase flow could be calculated. the chisholm model, which was included in the program to analyze the two-phase flow, can predict the results in a manner similar to those obtained from a real-scale experiment. by modifying the values of the input parameters and analyzing the results with respect to loss of coolant accident (loca) locations, the size of pipe and coefficients could be compared easily. since simulation results are shown in the form of a graph, the user is able to confirm the total breaking situation. furthermore, it is possible to save the entire simulation results. the simulation results were shown to be similar to those obtained from the real-scale experiment and the program functioned correctly. by using the program, the user is easily able to confirm the status of the siphon breaking, and the program is also helpful in the design of the siphon breaker.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the newly discovered citrus leprosis virus cytoplasmic type 2 (cilv-c2) is one of the causal virus of citrus leprosis disease complex; which leads to substantial loss of citrus production in the states of meta and casanare of colombia. specific and sensitive detection methods are needed to monitor the dissemination of cilv-c2 in colombia, and to prevent introduction of cilv-c2 to other citrus growing countries. toward this end, putative coat protein gene (cpg) of cilv-c2 was amplified from cilv-c2 infected citrus tissues. the cpg was cloned, expressed and purified a recombinant coat protein of 31 kda which used to generate monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera. four monoclonal antibodies and two polyclonal antisera were selected as being specific following western blotting. the monoclonal antibody mab e5 and polyclonal antiserum pab uf715 were selected testing with an extract of cilv-c2 infected leaves using triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (tas-elisa). in addition, an immunocapture rt-pcr was standardized using mab e5 for specific and sensitive detection of cilv-c2. the standardized tas-elisa and ic-rt-pcr were able to detect cilv-c2 in the extracts of symptomatic citrus leprosis tissues up to the dilutions of 1:160 and 1:2580, respectively. result demonstrated that cilv-c2 is present in citrus orchards in meta and casanare citrus growing areas of colombia. tas-elisa could be used for routine detection of cilv-c2, epidemiological studies, and for border inspections for quarantine purposes. ic-rt-pcr could be valuable for cilv-c2 validation and viral genome analysis.

manufacturing_engineering	based on the matching theory, the antecedence of partnership formation between buyer and supplier in manufacturing engineering is explored. the results show that strategic level matching and operational level matching are positively associated with partnership formation, and cultural level matching moderates effects of strategic level matching and operational level matching on partnership formation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background context: degenerative disc disease (ddd) remains without an effective therapy and presents a costly burden to society. purpose: based upon prior reports concerning the effects of notochordal cell-conditioned medium (nccm) on disc cells, we performed a proof of principle study to determine whether nccm could reduce cytotoxic stress-induced apoptosis in human disc nucleus pulposus (np) cells. study design/ setting: this is an ""in vitro"" fundamental or basic science study. methods: nucleus pulpous cells derived from 15 patients undergoing spinal surgery were treated with interleukin (il)-1 beta and fas ligand or etoposide in the presence of nccm. we determined proor antiapoptotic events using activated caspase assays and determined genomic regulation of apoptosis using polymerase chain reaction arrays validated usingwestern blotting methods. we interrogated cellular apoptotic regulation using jc-1 dye and flow cytometry and performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to evaluate np inflammatory cytokine secretion. results: notochordal cell-conditioned medium inhibits cytotoxic stress-induced caspase-9 and -3/7 activities and maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential in human npcells, thereby suppressing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. gene expression analysis revealed the x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein as a key player responsible for evading etoposide-induced apoptosis in the presence ofnccm, and we verified these data using western blotting. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results revealed distinct differences in il-6 and il-8 secretions by np cells in response to etoposide in the presence of nccm. conclusions: here we demonstrate for the first time that nccm reduces cytotoxic stressinduced apoptosis in human np cells. soluble factors present in nccm could be harnessed for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of ddd.

enzymology	a cell is a highly organized, dynamic, and intricate biological entity orchestrated by a myriad of proteins and their self-assemblies. because a protein 's actions depend on its coordination in both space and time, our curiosity about protein functions has extended from the test tube into the intracellular space of the cell. accordingly, modern technological developments and advances in enzymology have been geared towards analyzing protein functions within intact single cells. we discuss here how fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been employed to identify subcellular locations of proteins, detect reversible protein-protein interactions, and measure protein activity and kinetics in living cells. considering that fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been only recently recognized as a primary technique in enzymology, its potentials and outcomes in studying intracellular protein functions are projected to be immensely useful and enlightening. we anticipate that this review would inspire many investigators to study their proteins of interest beyond the conventional boundary of specific disciplines. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

human_metabolism	ascorbic acid (aa), dopamine (da), uric acid(ua) and tryptophan(trp) are considered as crucial small biomolecules for physiological processes in human metabolism. abnormal levels of these species will lead to the occurrence of some diseases and disorders. in this paper, polyethyleneimine (pei) covalent functionalized graphene(pei-g) was used to modify glassy carbon electrode and applied for the simultaneous and sensitive determination of the four molecules. the pei-g nanocomposite was characterized by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy(ftir), ultraviolet-visible (uv-vis), x-ray powder diffraction(xrd) and transmission electron microscopy(tem). the electrochemical behaviors of aa, da, ua and trp on pei-g modified electrode were studied in detail. and the optimal experimental conditions for the simultaneous determination of aa, da, ua and trp were explored. the results showed that the oxidation peaks of the four species could be well separated and the peak to peak separations were 298 mv (aa-da), 130 mv (da-ua) and 350 mv(ua-trp), respectively. the linear response ranges for the simultaneous detection of aa, da, ua and trp were 50-5800 mu mol/l, 30-2570 mu mol/l, 0.05-400 mu mol/l and 6-1000 mu mol/l, with the detection limits of 16.67 mu mol/l, 10 mu mol/l, 0.017 mu mol/l and 2 mu mol/l, respectively. the proposed method provides a promising strategy for the simultaneous detection of these species in practical application.
human_metabolism	obesity is associated with skeletal muscle insulin resistance, which is a crucial step in the development of type 2 diabetes. among the mechanisms by which obesity may lead to insulin resistance, lipotoxicity is one of the hypotheses being explored; others include inflammation or the oxidative stress hypotheses. this review focuses on the role of diacylglycerols (dag), a family of lipid metabolites implicated in the pathogenesis of lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. while recent studies report contradictory results in humans with regard to the importance of dag-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, other current literature highlight a potential role for dag as signalling molecules. this review will discuss possible hypotheses explaining these contradictory results and the need to explore further the role of dag in human metabolism.
machine_design	this paper presents a new accessory drive system for hybrid electric vehicles (hevs). this new concept involves a dual winding electric machine with simultaneous motor and generator functions. the electric machine provides power for all accessory loads such as the steering pump, compressors and 12 v loads. when the engine is off, the electric machine starts its motoring action and provides mechanical power to the accessory loads. simultaneously, the generator windings provide power for the 12 v loads. the proposed structure could be a viable choice for fault-tolerant applications because of the concentrated winding type that maintains electrical and magnetic isolation. design considerations of the proposed electric machine are outlined in the paper. the distributed winding topology and concentrated winding topologies are also compared. analytical proof of magnetic decoupling is presented and experimentally verified.
strength_of_materials	strength properties of materials under static and dynamic loading are essential quantities for characterizing mechanical behavior. quantitative measurements of static strengths achieved in the diamond anvil cell can be made using x-ray diffraction in a radial geometry for samples under non-hydrostatic compression. results for several metals up to 68 gpa show that the ratio of yield strength to shear modulus ranges from 0.01-0.03 and increases weakly with compression. trends at lower pressure for re, w, and epsilon-fe are consistent with available data above 1 mbar. strong ceramics such as b6o, c-si3n4, and tib2 achieve yield strengths as large at 10% of the shear modulus at pressures up to similar to 70 gpa. strengths of materials used as pressure media are quantitatively compared and evaluated.
strength_of_materials	the heterogeneous elastoplastic deformation of structural glasses is explored using the framework of the random first-order transition theory of the glass transition along with an extended mode-coupling theory that includes activated events. the theory involves coupling the continuum elastic theory of strain transport with mobility generation and transport as described in the theory of glass aging and rejuvenation. fluctuations that arise from the generation and transport of mobility, fictive temperature, and stress are treated explicitly. we examine the nonlinear flow of a glass under deformation at finite strain rate. the interplay among the fluctuating fields leads to the spatially heterogeneous dislocation of the particles in the glass, i.e., the appearance of shear bands of the type observed in metallic glasses deforming under mechanical stress.
southern_blotting	the obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite eimeria tenella, one of seven species of eimeria that infect chickens, elicits protective cell-mediated immunity against challenge infection. for this reason, recombinant e tenella parasites could be utilised as an effective vaccine vehicle for expressing foreign antigens and inducing immunity against heterologous intracellular microbes. a stable line of e. tenella expressing foreign genes is a prerequisite, and in this work an in vivo stable transfection system has been developed for this parasite using restriction enzyme-mediated integration (remi). two transgenic populations of e. tenella have been obtained that express yfp-yfp constitutively throughout the parasite life cycle. southern blotting and plasmid rescue analyses show that the introduced exogenous dna was integrated at random into the parasite genome. although the life cycle of the transgenic populations was delayed by at least 12 h and the output of oocysts was reduced 4-fold relative to the parental bj strain of e. tenella, the transgenic parasites were sufficiently immunogenic to protect chickens against challenge with either transgenic or parental parasites. these results are encouraging for the development of transgenic e. tenella as a vaccine vector and for more detailed investigation of the biology of i he genus eimeria.

strength_of_materials	the objective of the work is the investigation of the relationship between the mechanisms of the short-term tensile strength and the creep rupture strength at testing temperatures more than 2/3 of the materials' melting temperatures. the fundamental equations relating the materials tensile strength to the creep rupture strength at different temperatures and structural factors are obtained. these equations are derived by the use of the phenomenological and statistical thermodynamics of the crystalline lattice. the derived theoretical equation is used to determine creep on the bases of experimental values of the short-term test. the agreement between experimental and theoretical values of the creep is demonstrated. the presented results can be applied for prediction of the creep strength of new materials, particularly materials with enhanced mechanical properties.

computer-aided_design	background and purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the internal and marginal fit of chrome cobalt (co-cr) crowns were fabricated with laser sintering, computer-aided design (cad) and computer-aided manufacturing, and conventional methods. materials and methods: polyamide master and working models were designed and fabricated. the models were initially designed with a software application for three-dimensional (3d) cad (maya, autodesk inc.). all models were fabricated models were produced by a 3d printer (eosint p380 sls, eos). 128 1-unit co-cr fixed dental prostheses were fabricated with four different techniques: conventional lost wax method, milled wax with lost-wax method (mwlw), direct laser metal sintering (dlms), and milled co-cr (mco-cr). the cement film thickness of the marginal and internal gaps was measured by an observer using a stereomicroscope after taking digital photos in x24. results: best fit rates according to mean and standard deviations of all measurements was in dlms both in premolar (65.84) and molar (58.38) models in mm. a significant difference was found dlms and the rest of fabrication techniques (p 0.05). no significant difference was found between mco-cr and mwlw in all fabrication techniques both in premolar and molar models (p 0.05). conclusion: dmls was best fitting fabrication techniques for single crown based on the results.the best fit was found in marginal; the larger gap was found in occlusal.all groups were within the clinically acceptable misfit range.
hydraulics	this work develops a two-dimensional hydro-morphological model which can be used to simulate river hydraulics and morphology with various vegetation covers. the model system consists of five modules, including a hydrodynamic model, a sediment transport model, a vegetation model, a bank failure model and a bed deformation model. the secondary flow effects are incorporated through additional dispersion terms. the core components of the model system solve the full shallow water equations; this is coupled with a non-equilibrium sediment transport model. the new integrated model system is validated against a number of laboratory-scale test cases and then applied to a natural river. the satisfactory simulation results confirm the model 's capability in reproducing both stream hydraulics and channel morphological changes with vegetation. several hypothetical simulations indicate that the model can be used not only to predict flooding and morphological evolution with vegetation, but also to assess river restoration involving vegetation.

northern_blotting	the discovery and characterization of micrornas (mirnas) and other families of short rnas has led to a rapid expansion of research directed at elucidating their expression patterns and regulatory functions. here, we describe a convenient, sensitive, and straightforward method to detect and quantitate specific mirna levels in unfractionated total rna samples. the method, based on splinted ligation, does not require specialized equipment or any amplification step, and is significantly faster and more sensitive than northern blotting. we demonstrate that the method can be used to detect various classes of small regulatory rnas from different organisms.
genetics	biliary adenofibroma is a rare primary hepatic neoplasm, recognized in the world health organization classification, although only 14 cases have been reported to date. this series includes extended follow-up from 2 of the early case reports and 4 novel cases. clinical history and histology were reviewed in all 6 cases. tumor dna was analyzed for point mutations by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and copy number alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization. the patients included 4 females and 2 males presenting between 46 and 83 years of age, with tumors ranging from 7 to 16 cm in diameter. the tumors had similar morphology, with tubules and cysts lined mainly by bland to mildly atypical cuboidal epithelium embedded in fibrous stroma. multiplex polymerase chain reaction did not identify mutations in 4 tumors tested. three tumors tested by array comparative genomic hybridization showed chromosomal copy number alterations, including 1 with amplifications of ccnd1 and erbb2. three patients underwent resection with no recurrence at 21, 20, and 3 years of follow-up. one patient is alive after 14 months with no resection. two patients with margin-positive resections had local recurrence at 1 and 6 years after surgery. no patient had distant metastasis. the distinct morphology and multiple clonal cytogenetic alterations in biliary adenofibromas indicate that the lesions are neoplastic. amplifications of ccnd1 and erbb2 are not typical of benign neoplasms, and suggest that these tumors may have the ability to behave aggressively. however, the clinical outcomes in these patients suggest the neoplasms are only slowly progressive.

southern_blotting	background: human endogenous retroviruses (hervs) are suspected to play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis (ms). this suspicion has in part been based on increased expression of viral rna or proteins or antibodies targeting retroviral products in ms patients. recently, our group provided genetic evidence for association between the endogenous retrovirus herv-fc1 and ms, suggesting that herv-fc1 plays a role in this multifactorial disease. we have found increased expression of herv-fc1 in ms patients suffering from recent attack, but the underlying mechanism for association is still unknown. findings: evidence from animal models indicates that erv implication in the pathogenesis of diseases can be a result of extra copies of the virus in the germ line. therefore, we investigated the genome of 81 individuals, 74 patients with ms and 7 healthy controls, by means of southern blotting, for presence of extra herv-fc1 copies. the known insertion at the xq21.33 position was readily detectable, but no additional insertions in other genomic contexts could be identified in any studied individuals. this substantiates our previous copy-number pcr findings of a 2:1 ratio of herv-fc1 dna between women and men, as expected from the x-chromosome location; there was no difference between patient and control individuals. conclusions: no additional germ line copies of herv-fc1 could be identified, precluding such copies to underlie the association between this provirus and multiples sclerosis.
southern_blotting	objectives: the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) per-1 initially disseminated among pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in turkey. despite reports from other european countries, such strains have not been detected in greece until now. we describe the first bla(per-1)-positive p. aeruginosa isolates from greece and their genetic environment. methods: from january 2008 to december 2009, 287 consecutive non-duplicate p. aeruginosa isolates with reduced susceptibility or resistance to ceftazidime (mic >8 mg/l) were screened for esbl production with a modified boronic acid-based double-disc synergy test. phenotypically esbl-positive isolates were subjected to agar dilution, pfge and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). broad-spectrum bla genes were identified by pcr and sequencing. plasmid analysis and conjugation experiments were performed. the location of the bla(per-1) gene was detected by southern blotting and its genetic environment was characterized using inverse pcr. results: five isolates were phenotypically positive for esbl production, exhibited resistance to cefepime, ceftazidime, aztreonam and meropenem, and carried the bla(per-1) gene. mlst showed that they belonged to sequence type (st) 235, which belongs to the international clonal complex 11. four isolates had the same pfge pattern. southern blotting revealed the chromosomal location of the bla(per-1) gene. analysis of the bla(per-1) flanking regions showed identity to transposon tn1213 downstream and 1406 bp upstream of blaper-1. further upstream, an orfa gene and ispa12 were identified; both were truncated by the insertion of is6100. conclusions: this study confirmed the presence of per-1-producing p. aeruginosa strains in greece. the chromosomal location of bla(per-1), as part of a truncated transposon, suggests clonal expansion rather than horizontal gene transfer.
northern_blotting	frmd7 mutations are associated with x-linked idiopathic congenital nystagmus (icn); however, the underlying mechanisms whereby mutations of frmd7 lead to icn remain unclear. in a previous study, the first frmd7 splice variant (frmd7-s) was cloned and identified, and frmd7-s was hypothesized to play a significant role in neuronal differentiation and development. the present study investigated a novel multiple exon-skipping mrna splice variant of frmd7, termed frmd7_sv2, which was detected in nt2 cells using northern blotting. the mrna expression levels of frmd7_sv2 in the developing human fetal brain were examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (pcr), while the expression levels in nt2 cells treated with retinoid acid (ra) or bone morphogenetic protein-2 were investigated using quantitative pcr. the results revealed that the expression of frmd7_sv2 was spatially and temporally restricted in human fetal brain development, and was upregulated upon ra-induced neuronal differentiation of the nt2 cells. these results indicated that as a novel splice variant of frmd7, frmd7_sv2 may play a role in neuronal development.
hydraulics	nature-based approaches to flood risk management are increasing in popularity. evidence for the effectiveness at the catchment scale of such spatially distributed upstream measures is inconclusive. however, it also remains an open question whether, under certain conditions, the individual impacts of a collection of flood mitigation interventions could combine to produce a detrimental effect on runoff response. a modelling framework is presented for evaluation of the impacts of hillslope and in-channel natural flood management interventions. it couples an existing semidistributed hydrological model with a new, spatially explicit, hydraulic channel network routing model. the model is applied to assess a potential flood mitigation scheme in an agricultural catchment in north yorkshire, united kingdom, comprising various configurations of a single variety of in-channel feature. the hydrological model is used to generate subsurface and surface fluxes for a flood event in 2012. the network routing model is then applied to evaluate the response to the addition of up to 59 features. additional channel and floodplain storage of approximately 70,000m(3) is seen with a reduction of around 11% in peak discharge. although this might be sufficient to reduce flooding in moderate events, it is inadequate to prevent flooding in the double-peaked storm of the magnitude that caused damage within the catchment in 2012. some strategies using features specific to this catchment are suggested in order to improve the attenuation that could be achieved by applying a nature-based approach.
immunology	aim: this study aimed to evaluate the benefits of arnica montana on post-operative blood loss and seroma production in women undergoing unilateral total mastectomy by administering arnica montana 1000 korsakovian dilution (1000 k). materials and methods: from 2012 to 2014, 53 women were randomly assigned to a. montana or placebo and were followed up for 5 days. the main end point was the reduction in blood and serum volumes collected in drainages. secondary end points were duration of drainage, a self-evaluation of pain, and the presence of bruising or hematomas. results: the per-protocol analysis revealed a lower mean volume of blood and serum collected in drainages with a. montana (-94.40 ml; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 22.48-211.28; p = 0.11). a regression model including treatment, volume collected in the drainage on the day of surgery, and patient weight showed a statistically significant difference in favor of a. montana (-106.28 ml; 95% ci: 9.45-203.11; p = 0.03). volumes collected on the day of surgery and the following days were significantly lower with a. montana at days 2 (p = 0.033) and 3 (p = 0.0223). secondary end points have not revealed significant differences. conclusions: a. montana 1000 k could reduce post-operative blood and seroma collection in women undergoing unilateral total mastectomy. larger studies are needed with different dilutions of a. montana to further validate these data.
immunology	alpha-glucans are present in virtually all domains of life, and these glucose chains linked by alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-linked branches form the most important storage carbohydrates in cells. it is likely for this reason that alpha-glucans are not generally considered as bioactive molecules as beta-glucans are. nevertheless, it is known that depending on their source, many alpha-glucans play important roles as modulators of immune response. recent efforts have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms through which alpha-glucans exert their immunostimulant effects; however, the main challenge is the accurate identification of the receptors of immune cells involved in their recognition. here, we review the adjuvant properties reported for some polysaccharides and ultimately focus on alpha-glucans and how their structural characteristics, such as molecular weight, solubility and derivatization, influence their immunostimulatory properties. as a final point, we discuss the potential and associated challenges of using these polysaccharides as adjuvants, particularly in mucosal vaccination.

computer-aided_design	the physical conception of the memristor by the hewlett-packard labs has opened the possibility of combining this new fundamental circuit element with traditional devices in order to carried out novel applications. an important step for incorporating the memristor into the computer-aided design tools is to find an expression that represents the behavior of the device. in this paper, a novel modeling methodology for memristive systems using homotopy perturbation methods is introduced. this methodology is capable of generating a semi-symbolical expression that represents the memristive behavior of the device. the new memristor model is characterized in order to determinate the impact of the variables on the memristive behavior and establishes the range of compliance using the principal fingerprints of the memristor. besides, the novel memristor model is depicted by two cases of study. finally, the advantages of the memristor model are presented and discussed.
southern_blotting	a 79-year-old female diagnosed with t cell/histiocyte-rich large b cell lymphoma in complete remission after six cycles of rituximab-combined chemotherapy developed severe anemia, reticulocytopenia, and bone marrow erythroid hypoplasia. she was diagnosed with pure red cell aplasia (prca) accompanied by coombs-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia evidenced by a lack of glycophorin-a-positive cells in the bone marrow, haptoglobin under the detection level, and a high titer of rbc-bound igg. anti-erythropoietin receptor (epor) antibody was detected in the serum, and oligoclonal alpha/beta and gamma/delta t cells were also detected in her peripheral blood by southern blotting analysis. parvovirus b19 dna was not detected by pcr. although the treatment with rituximab had limited efficacy (specifically, only for hemolysis), subsequent cyclosporine therapy led to prompt recovery of erythropoiesis with the disappearance of anti-epor antibody and oligoclonal t cells. this is the first case report of anti-epor antibody-associated prca in a patient with malignant lymphoma treated successfully with cyclosporine.
molecular_biology	cardiac allograft vasculopathy (cav) is a transplant pathology, limiting graft survival after heart transplantation. cav arteries are surrounded by ectopic lymphoid structures (els) containing b cells and plasma cells. the aim of this study was to characterize the antigenic targets of antibodies produced in els. coronary arteries and surrounding epicardial tissue from 56 transplant recipients were collected during autopsy. immunofluorescence was used to identify antibody-producing plasma cells. immunoglobulin levels in tissue lysates were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and analyzed for donor-specific hla antibodies by luminex assay. cytokine and receptor expression levels were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. plasma cells in els were polyclonal and produced igg and/or igm antibodies. in epicardial tissue, igg (p < 0.05) and igm levels were higher in transplant patients with larger els than smaller els. in 4 of 21 (19%) patients with els, donor-specific hla type ii antibodies were detected locally. cytokine and receptor expression (cxcr3, interferon and tgf-) was higher in large els in the epicardial tissue than in other vessel wall layers, suggesting active recruitment and proliferation of t and b lymphocytes. els exhibited active plasma cells producing locally manufactured antibodies that, in some cases, were directed against the donor hla, potentially mediating rejection with major consequences for the graft. ectopic lymphoid structures surrounding coronary arteries with allograft vasculopathy contain high levels of antibodies directed, in part, toward donor hla class ii.
computer-aided_design	a 3-d electron-beam-induced current (ebic) model was implemented in technology computer aided design simulations. the model uses a carefully designed charge carrier generation profile that describes how an electron beam induces charge carriers in a semiconducting device and then drift-diffusion equations are solved to determine the resulting current. the simulation provides a map of the ebic signal, which can be compared with experimental 2-d profiles. this comparison can be used to fit parameters such as the surface recombination rate which is otherwise difficult to fit in completed devices. additional experimental data for these fits are obtained by performing the experiments at different electron beam energies and thereby generating carriers at different depths in the sample. the experiments were performed on cross sections of silicon photodiodes with varying surface preparations. a strong influence of the surface preparation method on the charge carrier diffusion was observed.
immunology	mounting evidence has shown that naturally occurring cd8+cd122+ t cells are regulatory t cells (tregs) that suppress both autoimmunity and alloimmunity. we have previously shown that cd8+cd122+pd-1+ tregs not only suppress allograft rejection, but also are more potent in suppression than conventional cd4+cd25+ tregs. however, the mechanisms underlying their suppression of alloimmunity are not well understood. in an adoptive t-cell transfer model of mice lacking lymphocytes, we found that suppression of skin allograft rejection by cd8+cd122+pd-1+ tregs was mostly dependent on their expression of fas ligand as either lacking fas ligand or blocking it with antibodies largely abolished their suppression of allograft rejection mediated by transferred t cells. their suppression was also mostly reversed when effector t cells lacked fas receptor. indeed, these fasl+tregs induced t cell apoptosis in vitro in a fas/fasl-dependent manner. however, their suppression of t cell proliferation in vitro was dependent on il-10, but not fasl expression. furthermore, adoptive transfer of cd8+cd122+pd-1+ tregs significantly extended allograft survival even in wild-type mice if tregs lacked fas receptor or if recipients received recombinant il-15, as these two measures synergistically expanded adoptively-transferred tregs in recipients. thus, this study may have important implications for treg therapies in clinical transplantation.
immunology	introduction: the recent approval of adalimumab (trade name humira, abbvie inc.) by the fda for the treatment of noninfectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis marks the first on label' non-corticosteroid drug available to ophthalmologists. immunomodulatory (imt) and biologic agents have long been shown to be effective in inducing remission of chronic uveitis but have remained as orphan drugs due to lack of financial incentive and perceived need. areas covered: here we provide detail into the background and use of adalimumab for uveitic patients. topics include pharmacology, therapeutic indications and usage, dosage, drug safety, physician monitoring, side effects and adverse events. expert opinion: we see the approval of adalimumab for uveitis as an important milestone improving upon the accepted standards of care for patients with this severe, sight threatening disease. we implore medical professionals to consider the use of imt and biologic treatments for patients with recurrent non-infectious uveitis, referring to ocular immunology and uveitis specialists when necessary.
southern_blotting	the feasibility of cyclo-(d-trp-tyr) peptide nanotubes (pnts) as oral gene delivery carriers was investigated in nude mice with eight 40 mu g doses of pcmv-lacz in 2 days at 3 h intervals. the association between dna and pnts, the dnase i stability of pnts-associated dna, and in vitro permeability of dna were estimated. the results showed that the cyclo-(d-trp-tyr) pnts self-associated at concentrations above 0.01 mg/ml. plasmid dna associated with pnts with a binding constant of 3.2 x 10(8)m(-1) calculated by a fluorescence quenching assay. pnts were able to protect dna from dnase i, acid, and bile digestion for 50 min, 60 min, and 180 min, respectively. the in vitro duodenal apparent permeability coefficient of pcmv-lacz calculated from a steady state flux was increased from 49.2 +/- 21.6 x 10(-10) cm/s of naked dna to 395.6 +/- 142.2 x 10(-10) cm/s of pcmv-lacz/pnt formulation. the permeation of pcmv-lacz formulated with pnts was found in an energy-dependent process. furthermore, beta-galatosidase (beta-gal) activity in tissues was quantitatively assessed using chlorophenol red-beta-d-galactopyranoside (cprg) and was significantly increased by 41% in the kidneys at 48 h and by 49, 63, and 46% in the stomach, duodenum, and liver, respectively, at 72 h after the first dose of oral delivery of pcmv-lacz/pnt formulation. the organs with beta-gal activity were confirmed for the presence of pcmv-lacz dna with southern blotting analysis and intracellular tracing the tm-rhodamine-labeled dna and the presence of mrna by reverse transcription-real time quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr). another plasmid (pcmv-hrluc) encoding renilla reniformis luciferase was used to confirm the results. an increased hrluc mrna and luciferase in stomach, duodenum, liver, and kidney were detected by rt-qpcr, ex vivo bioluminescence imaging, luciferase activity quantification, and immunostaining, respectively.
strength_of_materials	flexural vibration analysis of beams made of functionally graded materials (fgms) with various boundary conditions is considered in this paper. due to technical problems during fgm fabrication, porosities and micro-voids can be created inside fgm samples which may lead to the reduction in density and strength of materials. in this investigation, the fgm beams are assumed to have even and uneven distributions of porosities over the beam cross-section. the modified rule of mixture is used to approximate material properties of the fgm beams including the porosity volume fraction. in order to cover the effects of shear deformation, axial and rotary inertia, the timoshenko beam theory is used to form the coupled equations of motion for describing dynamic behavior of the beams. to solve such a problem, chebyshev collocation method is employed to find natural frequencies of the beams supported by different end conditions. based on numerical results, it is revealed that fgm beams with even distribution of porosities have more significant impact on natural frequencies than fgm beams with uneven porosity distribution.
cell_biology	with advances in dna sequencing technology, it is increasingly common and tractable to informatically look for genes of interest in the genomic databases of parasitic organisms and infer cellular states. assignment of a putative gene function based on homology to functionally characterized genes in other organisms, though powerful, relies on the implicit assumption of functional homology, i.e. that orthology indicates conserved function. eukaryotes reveal a dazzling array of cellular features and structural organization, suggesting a concomitant diversity in their underlying molecular machinery. significantly, examples of novel functions for pre-existing or new paralogues are not uncommon. do these examples undermine the basic assumption of functional homology, especially in parasitic protists, which are often highly derived? here we examine the extent to which functional homology exists between organisms spanning the eukaryotic lineage. by comparing membrane trafficking proteins between parasitic protists and traditional model organisms, where direct functional evidence is available, we find that function is indeed largely conserved between orthologues, albeit with significant adaptation arising from the unique biological features within each lineage.

genetics	objective: the etiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is assumed to involve interactions between genetically determined vulnerability factors and significant environmental features. here, we aim to investigate how the personality trait harm avoidance and the experience of childhood adversities contribute to ocd. method: a total of 169 patients with ocd, 157 healthy comparison subjects, and 57 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with ocd participated in the study. harm avoidance was assessed using the temperament and character inventory, and the severity of childhood adversities was measured with the childhood trauma questionnaire. results: both patients with ocd and relatives showed elevated levels of harm avoidance compared to controls. furthermore, patients exhibited significantly higher scores than relatives. this linear pattern was observed throughout all subscales of harm avoidance, and remained stable after controlling for the severity of depressive and obsessivecompulsive symptoms. with regard to childhood adversities, patients with ocd reported higher levels than relatives and controls. conclusion: our results provide further evidence for a diathesis-stress model of ocd. while patients and unaffected relatives share elevated levels of harm avoidance, supporting the role of harm avoidance as an endophenotype of ocd, a heightened severity of childhood adversity was only observed in patients. the assumed biological underpinnings of these findings are discussed.
computer-aided_design	a feasibility study was performed in order to demonstrate the benefits of designing and manufacturing a customized foot orthosis by means of digital technologies, such as reverse engineering (re), generative design (gd) and additive manufacturing (am). the aim of this work was to define the complete design-manufacturing process, starting from the 3d scanning of the human foot anatomy to the direct fabricating of the customized foot orthosis. moreover, this first methodological study tries to combine a user-friendly semi-automatic modelling approach with the use of low-cost devices for the 3d laser scanning and the 3d printing processes. finally, the result of this approach, based on digital technologies, was also compared with that achieved by means of conventional manual techniques.
internal_combustion_engine	this article presents a fuel consumption model, sefum (semi empirical fuel use modeling), and its comparison with three models from the literature on a 600 km experimental database. this model is easy to calibrate with only a few required parameters that are provided by car manufacturers. the test database has been built from 21 drivers who drove in two conditions (normal and ecodriving) on a 15 km trip. for the model evaluation, three indicators have been selected: instantaneous fuel use root mean square error, cumulated error and computation time in order to evaluate the accuracy both in cumulated and instantaneous fuel use and to estimate computation time of each model. results tend to prove that the model is able to compute rapidly (maximum of 1500 simulated kilometers under matlab) in comparison to all other models while ensuring a high accuracy and precision for cumulated and instantaneous fuel use.

internal_combustion_engine	this brief investigates the cycle-to-cycle transient behavior of the residual gas fraction (rgf) in terms of systems theory and proposes a multivalued logic-based optimal control strategy for the attenuation of rgf fluctuation. first, an incylinder pressure-based method for measuring rgf is provided, and the stochastic properties of the rgf are examined based on statistical data obtained by conducting experiments on a full-scale internal combustion engine test bench. based on the observation of the experiment, a stochastic logical transient model is proposed to represent the cycle-to-cycle transient behavior of the rgf. then, an optimal feedback control law, which targets the rejection of the rgf fluctuation, is derived using the policy iteration algorithm. finally, the experimental result is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal control law.
genetics	the care and prevention of congenital disorders (cds) is an emerging but unprioritised health need in south africa (sa). inadequate empirical data and underreporting conceal the true burden of cds while medical genetic services to confront the problem have regressed. positive epidemiological transition in the country now demands these services are improved to significantly further reduce child mortality. current sector capacity in sa is inadequate and required personnel targets will not be reached quickly enough to meet the growing health need even if relevant posts are designated. historically, genetic-trained nurses played a defined role in primary healthcare (phc) by recognising and diagnosing common cds and counselling patients and their families, while referring complex matters to the limited tertiary medical genetic services available. policy changes to redress past inequalities and other healthcare priorities resulted in genetic services being incorporated into phc, with few genetic nurses retaining their genetic services role. while the medium- to long-term aim for sa would be to develop medical genetic services with appropriate capacity at all levels of healthcare, there is an urgent short-term need to provide basic medical genetic services in phc. central to achieving this is the upgrading and re-implementation of the previously successful medical genetics education programme (mgep). this post-graduate distance learning, education programme is implemented with the congenital disorders course book, a distance education tool promoting independent, home-based learning. together, these tools offer an approach to swiftly build up a nursing work-force with improved knowledge and skills in medical genetics.
cell_biology	aim to assess the rate of matrix gla-protein carboxylation in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and to decipher its association with subclinical atherosclerosis. methods patients with suspected sibo who presented with a low risk for cardiovascular disease and showed no evidence of atherosclerotic plaques were included in the study. a glucose breath test was performed in order to confirm the diagnosis of sibo and vascular assessment was carried out by ultrasound examination. plasma levels of the inactive form of mgp (dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix gla-protein) were quantified by elisa and vitamin k2 intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire. results thirty-nine patients were included in the study. sibo was confirmed in 12/39 (30.8%) patients who also presented with a higher concentration of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix gla-protein (9.5 mu g/l vs 4.2 mu g/l; p = 0.004). arterial stiffness was elevated in the sibo group (pulse-wave velocity 10.25 m/s vs 7.68 m/s; p = 0.002) and this phenomenon was observed to correlate linearly with the levels of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix gla-protein (beta = 0.220, r-2 = 0.366, p = 0.03). carotid intima-media thickness and arterial calcifications were not observed to be significantly elevated as compared to controls. conclusion sibo is associated with reduced matrix gla-protein activation as well as arterial stiffening. both these observations are regarded as important indicators of subclinical atherosclerosis. hence, screening for sibo, intestinal decontamination and supplementation with vitamin k2 has the potential to be incorporated into clinical practice as additional preventive measures.
internal_combustion_engine	turbocompounding is an important technique to recover waste heat from engine exhaust and reduce co2 emission. this paper presents a parametric study of turbocompound diesel engine based on analytical model. an analytical model was developed to investigate the influence of system parameters on the engine fuel consumption. the model is based on thermodynamics knowledge and empirical models, which can consider the impacts of each parameter independently. the effects of turbine efficiency, back pressure, exhaust temperature, pressure ratio and engine speed on the recovery energy, pumping loss and engine fuel reductions were studied. results show that turbine efficiency, exhaust temperature and back pressure has great influence on the fuel reduction and optimal power turbine (pt) expansion ratio. however, engine operation speed has little impact on the fuel savings obtained by turbocompounding. the interaction mechanism between the pt recovery power and engine pumping loss is presented in the paper. due to the nonlinear characteristic of turbine power, there is an optimum value of pt expansion ratio to achieve largest power gain. at the end, the fuel saving potential of high performance turbocompound engine and the requirements for it are proposed in the paper.

immunology	invertebrate immune priming is a growing field in immunology. this phenomenon refers to the ability of invertebrates to generate a more vigorous immune response to a second encounter with a specific pathogen and can occur within and across generations. although the precise mechanism has not been elucidated, it has been suggested that methylation of dna is a cornerstone for this phenomenon. here, using a novel method of analytical chemistry (a reversed-phase liquid chromatography procedure) and the beetle tenebrio molitor as a model system, we did not find evidence to support this hypothesis taking into account the percentage of methylated cytosine entities in dna (5mdc) within or across generations. however, we found a lower percentage of methylated cytosine entities in rna (5mc) within but not across generations in immune priming experiments with adults against the bacteria micrococcus lysodeikticus and larvae against the fungus metarhizium anisopliae. to our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting a role of differential methylation on rna during immune priming within generations.
immunology	the lungs are constantly exposed to the external environment, which in addition to harmless particles, also contains pathogens, allergens, and toxins. in order to maintain tolerance or to induce an immune response, the immune system must appropriately handle inhaled antigens. lung dendritic cells (dcs) are essential in maintaining a delicate balance to initiate immunity when required without causing collateral damage to the lungs due to an exaggerated inflammatory response. while there is a detailed understanding of the phenotype and function of immune cells such as dcs in human blood, the knowledge of these cells in less accessible tissues, such as the lungs, is much more limited, since studies of human lung tissue samples, especially from healthy individuals, are scarce. this work presents a strategy to generate detailed spatial and phenotypic characterization of lung tissue resident dcs in healthy humans that undergo a bronchoscopy for the sampling of endobronchial biopsies. several small biopsies can be collected from each individual and can be subsequently embedded for ultrafine sectioning or enzymatically digested for advanced flow cytometric analysis. the outlined protocols have been optimized to yield maximum information from small tissue samples that, under steady-state conditions, contain only a low frequency of dcs. while the present work focuses on dcs, the methods described can directly be expanded to include other (immune) cells of interest found in mucosal lung tissue. furthermore, the protocols are also directly applicable to samples obtained from patients suffering from pulmonary diseases where bronchoscopy is part of establishing the diagnosis, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), sarcoidosis, or lung cancer.
hydraulics	hydroinformatics emerged in 1991 when numerical modelling of water expanded its range from one that was restricted to the modelling of flows to a much wider ranging sociotechnical discipline that supports stakeholders in addressing their water-related problems. however, despite numerous advances in hydroinformatics, the current practical and research effort is still very much technocratic (or techno-centric) which in turn may restrict the potential of hydroinformatics in its scope and its reach. this special issue, through the compilation of thirteen papers, illustrates some of the developments and applications in the field of hydroinformatics and marks the twenty-five years of its existence. we hope that this will help to further raise the awareness of the subject and its developments and applications. in the editorial of this special issue, we briefly discuss the origin of hydroinformatics and we introduce the papers that are featuring in this special issue. we also give a way forward for future research and application.
enzymology	complex carbohydrates are ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. as major components of the plant cell wall they constitute both a rich renewable carbon source for biotechnological transformation into fuels, chemicals and materials, and also form an important energy source as part of a healthy human diet. in both contexts, there has been significant, sustained interest in understanding how microbes transform these substrates. classical perspectives of microbial polysaccharide degradation are currently being augmented by recent advances in the discovery of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (lpmos) and polysaccharide utilization loci (puls). fundamental discoveries in carbohydrate enzymology are both advancing biological understanding, as well as informing applications in industrial biomass conversion and modulation of the human gut microbiota to mediate health benefits.
northern_blotting	the dogfish ortholog of aquaporin 4 (aqp4) was amplified from cdna using degenerate pcr followed by cloning and sequencing. the complete coding region was then obtained using 5' and 3' race techniques. alignment of the sequence with aqp4 amino acid sequences from other species showed that dogfish aqp4 has high levels (up to 65.3%) of homology with higher vertebrate sequences but lower levels of homology to agnathan (38.2%) or teleost (57.5%) fish sequences. northern blotting indicated that the dogfish mrna was approximately 3.2 kb and was highly expressed in the rectal gland (a shark fluid secretory organ). semi-quantitative pcr further indicates that aqp4 is ubiquitous, being expressed in all tissues measured but at low levels in certain tissues, where the level in liver >gill >intestine. manipulation of the external environmental salinity of groups of dogfish showed that when fish were acclimated in stages to 120% seawater (sw) or 75% sw, there was no change in aqp4 mrna expression in either rectal gland, kidney, or esophagus/cardiac stomach. whereas quantitative pcr experiments using the rna samples from the same experiment, showed a significant 63.1% lower abundance of gill aqp4 mrna expression in 120% sw-acclimated dogfish. the function of dogfish aqp4 was also determined by measuring the effect of the aqp4 expression in xenopus laevis oocytes. dogfish aqp4 expressing-oocytes, exhibited significantly increased osmotic water permeability (p-f) compared to controls, and this was invariant with ph. permeability was not significantly reduced by treatment of oocytes with mercury chloride, as is also the case with aqp4 in other species. similarly aqp4 expressing-oocytes did not exhibit enhanced urea or glycerol permeability, which is also consistent with the water-selective property of aqp4 in other species.
fluid_mechanics	a methodology for predicting scaling in membrane distillation (md), which considers thermodynamics, kinetics, and fluid mechanics, is developed and experimentally validated with calcium sulfate. the theory predicts the incidence of scaling as a function of temperature, concentration, and flow conditions by comparing the nucleation induction time to the residence time and applying an experimental correction factor. the relevant residence time is identified by considering a volume of solution near the membrane surface that contains enough ions to form a nucleus of critical size. the theory is validated with fouling experiments using calcium sulfate as a model sealant over a range of temperatures (40-70 degrees c) saturation indices, and flow rates. although the model is validated with a bench-scale md system, it is hoped to be compatible with large-scale systems that may have significant changes in concentration, temperature, and flow rate along the flow direction. at lower temperatures, the saturation index can be as high as 0.4-0.5 without scaling, but the safe concentration limit decreases with increasing temperature. increasing the feed flow rate reduces concentration polarization and fluid residence time, both of which decrease the likelihood of fouling. the model is translated into easily readable maps outlining safe operating regimes for md. the theory and maps can be used to choose safe operating conditions in md over a wide range of conditions and system geometries.
southern_blotting	to generate transgenic lily plants with no selectable marker and improved tolerance to abiotic stress, two vectors were co-transformed into the lilium oriental hybrid sorbonne by particle bombardment. the pksb vector included the cre/loxp-mediated site-specific cdna excision system under control of the inducible promoter rd29a, and the pbpc-p5cs-f129a vector carried the p5cs gene, which we hypothesized would improve resistance to drought and salt stresses in transgenic lily plantlets. the presence of the two genes was simultaneously detected by pcr and southern blotting in two resistant plantlets. the co-transformation rate was 0.16%. subsequently, inducer expression was tested under varying conditions to optimize the deletion of marker gene. results from molecular detection assays revealed that maintaining bases of bulblet scales at 4 degrees c for 12 h resulted in an increase in the excision rate, reaching 60%. expression of p5cs improved resistance to salt stress in transgenic lily plantlets. these results demonstrated the feasibility of using the cre/loxp-based marker elimination system to generate marker-free transgenic plantlets with improved stress tolerance.
human_metabolism	introduction: sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (sglt2) inhibitors inhibit glucose re-absorption in the proximal renal tubules. these drugs also affect many anthropometric and metabolic parameters with various mechanisms of action.areas covered: we present the available evidence regarding these effects. sglt2 inhibitors can decrease body weight mainly due to a reduction of total fat mass. sglt2 inhibitors can decrease blood pressure levels and serum uric acid levels and may also reduce the degree of diabetes-related albuminuria. these effects may have contributed in the beneficial cardiovascular effects seen in the empa-reg outcome trial. on the other hand, the sglt2 inhibition-induced natriuresis and osmotic diuresis could lead to a decrease of extracellular volume. a small increase in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol has been observed with sglt2 inhibitors. a small increase in serum phosphate concentration has been reported with these drugs due to increased phosphate reabsorption, which combined with an increase in serum parathormone may adversely affect bone homeostasis. in rare cases, sglt2 inhibitors administration may be followed by euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.expert opinion: sglt2 inhibitors improve many aspects of human metabolism and may be beneficial in diabetic patients if certain precautions are followed by clinicians during the administration of these drugs.
genetics	the intense focus on studying human height has done more than any other genetic analysis to advance our understanding of the heritability of highly complex phenotypes. here, we describe in detail the properties of a previously unexplored trait in drosophila melanogaster that shares many salient properties with human height. the total length of the pupal case varies between 2.8 and 3.9mm among natural variants, and we report that it is among the most heritable traits reported in this species. we have developed a simple semiautomatic phenotyping system with which a single operator can reliably score >5000 individuals in a day. the precision of the automated system is 0.042mm (+/- 0.030sd). all phenotyped individuals are available to be mated in subsequent generations or uniquely archived for future molecular work. we report both broad sense and narrow sense heritability estimates for two biologically distinct data sets. narrow sense heritability (h(2)) ranged from 0.44 to 0.50, and broad sense heritability (h-2) ranged from 0.58 to 0.61. we present results for mapping the trait in 195 recombinant inbred lines, which suggests that there are no loci with >10% effect size in this panel. we propose that pupal size genetics in drosophila could represent a model complex trait amenable to deep genetic dissection using the automated system described.
fluid_mechanics	in this study, an in vitro device that mimics the oral phase of swallowing is calibrated using in vivo measurements. the oral flow behavior of different newtonian and non-newtonian solutions is then investigated in vitro, revealing that shear-thinning thickeners used in the treatment of dysphagia behave very similar to low-viscosity newtonian liquids during active swallowing, but provide better control of the bolus before the swallow is initiated. a theoretical model is used to interpret the experimental results and enables the identification of two dynamical regimes for the flow of the bolus: first, an inertial regime of constant acceleration dependent on the applied force and system inertia, possibly followed by a viscous regime in which the viscosity governs the constant velocity of the bolus. this mechanistic understanding provides a plausible explanation for similarities and differences in swallowing performance of shear-thinning and newtonian liquids. finally, the physiological implications of the model and experimental results are discussed. in vitro and theoretical results suggest that individuals with poor tongue strength are more sensitive to overly thickened boluses. the model also suggests that while the effects of system inertia are significant, the density of the bolus itself plays a negligible role in its dynamics. this is confirmed by experiments on a high density contrast agent used for videofluoroscopy, revealing that theologically matched contrast agents and thickener solutions flow very similarly. in vitro experiments and theoretical insights can help designing novel thickener formulations before clinical evaluations.

genetics	cardiac development in vertebrates is a finely tuned process regulated by a set of conserved signaling pathways. perturbations of these processes are often associated with congenital cardiac malformations. platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (pdgfr alpha) is a highly conserved tyrosine kinase receptor, which is essential for development and organogenesis. disruption of pdgfr alpha function in murine models is embryonic lethal due to severe cardiovascular defects, suggesting a role in cardiac development, thus necessitating the use of alternative models to explore its precise function. in this study, we generated a zebrafish pdgfra mutant line by gene trapping, in which the pdgfra protein is truncated and fused with mrfp (pdgfra-mrfp). our results demonstrate that pdgfra mutants have defects in cardiac morphology as a result of abnormal fusion of myocardial precursors. expression analysis of the developing heart at later stages suggested that pdgfra-mrfp is expressed in the endocardium. further examination of the endocardium in pdgfra mutants revealed defective endocardial migration to the midline, where cardiac fusion eventually occurs. together, our data suggests that pdgfra is required for proper medial migration of both endocardial and myocardial precursors, an essential step required for cardiac assembly and development.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose. the purpose of this study was to determine the endogenous regulation pattern of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (timp-2) in the tree shrew sclera during myopia development and investigate the capacity of exogenous timp-2 to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp-2) in vitro and both scleral collagen degradation and myopia development in vivo. methods. timp-2 expression in the sclera during myopia development was assessed using polymerase chain reaction. in vitro timp-2 inhibition of mmp-2 was investigated using a gelatinase activity plate assay and zymography. tree shrews were injected with a collagen precursor before undergoing monocular form deprivation and concurrent daily subconjunctival injections of either timp-2 or vehicle to the form-deprived eye. in vivo ocular biometry changes were monitored, and scleral tissue was collected after 12 days and assayed for collagen degradation. results. the development of myopia was associated with a mean reduction in timp-2 mrna expression after 5 days of form deprivation (p < 0.01). both activation and activity of mmp-2 were inhibited by timp-2 with an ic50 of 10 to 20 and 2 nm, respectively. in vivo exogenous addition of timp-2 significantly reduced myopia development (p < 0.01), due to reduced vitreous chamber elongation (p < 0.01). in vivo timp-2 treatment also significantly inhibited posterior scleral collagen degradation relative to vehicle-treated eyes (p < 0.01), with levels similar to those in control eyes. conclusions. myopia development in mammals is associated with reduced expression of timp-2, which contributes to increased degradative activity in the sclera. it follows that replenishment of this timp-2 significantly reduced the rate of both scleral collagen degradation and myopia development.
polymerase_chain_reaction	nervous necrosis virus (nnv), one of the most prevalent fish pathogens, has caused fatal disease of viral nervous necrosis (vnn) in many marine and freshwater fishes, and resulted in heavy economic losses in aquaculture industry worldwide. however, the morecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of nnv remain elusive. in this study, the expression profiles of microrna (mirna) were investigated in grouper fin (gf-1) cells infected with red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (rgnnv) via deep sequencing technique. the results showed that a total of 220 mirnas were identified by aligning the small rna sequences with the mirna database of zebrafish, and 18 novel mirnas were predicted using mirdeep2 software. compared with the non-infected groups, 51 and 16 differentially expressed mirnas (de-mirnas) were identified in the samples infected with rgnnv at 3 and 24 h, respectively. six demirnas were randomly selected to validate their expressions using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr), the results showed that their expression profiles were consistent with those obtained by deep sequencing. the target genes of the de-mirnas covered a wide range of functions, such as regulation of transcription, oxidation-reduction process, proteolysis, regulation of apoptotic process, and immune response. in addition, the effects of four de-mirnas including mir-1, mir-30b, mir-150, and mir-184 on rgnnv replication were evaluated, and the results showed that over-expression of each of the four mirnas promoted the replication of rgnnv. these data provide insight into the molecular mechanism of rgnnv infection, and will benefit for the development of effective strategies to control rgnnv infection.

polymerase_chain_reaction	backgroundthe incidence of cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial (ntm) infection has increased in recent decades because of widespread use of immunosuppressive therapy and better detection methods. the histopathology of cutaneous ntm infection is not pathognomic and the organisms are slow and difficult to culture, making diagnosis challenging. methodswe reviewed the clinical and histopathological features of 13 cases of cutaneous ntm infection, and performed panmycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) on the paraffin blocks. resultsthe immunocompetent patients presented with localized lesions on the extremities, whereas the immunocompromised patients presented with disseminated cutaneous lesions. the histopathology in immunocompetent patients was characterized by pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia, intraepithelial abscesses, transepidermal elimination and dermal granulomatous inflammation accompanied by necrosis and suppuration. the immunocompromised patients showed suppurative inflammation with little granuloma formation and numerous acid-fast bacilli. paraffin block pcr was positive in 4 of 13 cases (31%), whereas culture was positive in 11 of 13 cases (85%). conclusionthe aforementioned histological features should help in diagnosing cutaneous ntm infection when combined with clinical and microbiological correlation. in our study, we did not find paraffin block pcr to be superior to conventional culture in detecting cutaneous ntm infection.
machine_design	this paper presents the design of a novel electronic voting machine using microcontroller. voter 's information facility has also been incorporated in the machine design. the information about the number of voters present at the polling place is stored in a register, which is later used to do various analyses. infrared sensors have been used for determining the voter 's information. the design proposed here has a special option of vote rejection which is not present in the conventional systems. the simulation of the system is done on proteus professional software v8.0. multiple vote casting has been avoided by using software coding techniques. the design presented in this paper is appropriate and the simulation is working properly under normal conditions.
molecular_biology	the significant contribution of microbial corrosion to material degradation in industrial environments has been widely investigated, especially in recent years. however, the process remains largely underestimated and, more than ever today, its control is proved to be difficult. indeed, some recent environmental issues and regulatory led to the reduction of the biocides and anticorrosive treatments, often without an appropriate revision of procedures and without a careful monitoring, thus affecting the effectiveness of the treatments. a multitude of bacterial species lives within the ""corrosive"" biofilm, where organisms interacts in synergistically or competitive way adapting themselves to external agents, even in extreme conditions. combining modern electrochemical techniques and molecular biology it is possible today to monitor the biocorrosion risk and to highlight the complexity of the phenomenon. the relevant involvement of specific bacterial strains, including the sulphate reducers and other bacteria of the sulfur cycle, as well as the role of enzymes of the oxidative metabolism has been confirmed by these techniques. these enzymes can be expressed by a vast number of microorganisms, both aerobic and anaerobic, as function of environmental conditions.
enzymology	phospholipase d (pld) is a useful enzyme for its transphosphatidylation activity, which enables the enzymatic synthesis of various phospholipids (pls). many reports exist on plo-mediated synthesis of natural and tailor-made pls with functional head groups, from easily available lecithin or phosphatidylcholine. early studies on plo-mediated synthesis mainly employed enzymes of plant origin, which were later supplanted by ones from microorganisms, especially actinomycetes. many plds are members of the pld superfamily, having one or two copies of a signature sequence, hxkxxxxd or hkd motif, in the primary structures. plo superfamily members share a common core structure, and thereby, a common catalytic mechanism. the catalysis proceeds via two-step reaction with the formation of phosphatidyl-enzyme intermediate. both of the two catalytic his residues are critical in the reaction course, where one acts as a nucleophile, while the other functions as a general acid/base. pld is being engineered to improve its activity and stability, alter head group specificity and further identify catalytically important residues. since the knowledge on pld enzymology is constantly expanding, this review focuses on recent advances in the field, regarding pld-catalyzed synthesis of bioactive pls, deeper understanding of substrate recognition and binding mechanism, altering substrate specificity, and improving thermostability. we introduced some of our recent results in combination with existing facts to further deepen the story on the nature of this useful enzyme.

enzymology	in this article, we discuss methods of soil enzymatic analysis (pedo-enzymes) used in all specialized laboratories in recent years to determine the potential of various biochemical processes to asess and track soil fertility. initially, general biochemical methods were used for this purpose such as the methods of rogers (1942) for measuring phosphatase activity; kuprevici (1951) for assesing urease activity and the method of hofmann and seegerer (1951) for quantifying sucrase activity; these methods relied on introducing a specific enzyme substrate in the mixture such as: beta-glycerophosphate, urea or sucrose and determining quantitative enzyme products such as phosphate ions, glucose or ammonium ions, respectively. in biochemistry, results of enzyme tests are expressed in international units of enzyme found in the sample of analyzed material. from the agricultural point of view, such measurement of naturally-occuring enzyme substrates are not useful, with pedo-enzymology being more focused on assessing at what level the hydrolase processes unfold, thus providing nutrients for plants. consequently, stefanic.

(1965; 1998), irimescu and stefanic (1998) and stefanic and gheorghita (2008) recommended new methods of analysis for determining the level of total phosphatasic activity and total amidasic activity as markers of soil fertility status.
cell_biology	lipids are a crucial and diverse class of biomolecules. their structural heterogeneity in plants is staggering, and many aspects of plant life are manifested and mediated by lipids. recent advances in metabolomic and lipidomic technologies and analysis have immensely increased our knowledge of the plant lipidome, its biosynthesis, regulation, adaptation, remodeling, functions, roles, and interactions. here we review the recent literature and trends in lipidomics, and discuss specific issues pertaining to lipidomic research in plants, and how lipidomics has helped elucidate key issues in plant cell biology, immunity, response to stress, evolution, crop enhancement-to name but a few.

fluid_mechanics	data-driven low-order modelling has been enjoying rapid advances in fluid mechanics. arguably, sirovich (q. appl. maths, vol. xlv, 1987, pp. 561-571) started these developments with snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition, a particularly simple method. the resulting reduced-order models provide valuable insights into flow physics, allow inexpensive explorations of dynamics and operating conditions, and enable model-based control design. a winning argument for proper orthogonal decomposition (pod) is the optimality property, i.e. the guarantee of the least residual for a given number of modes. the price is unpleasant frequency mixing in the modes which complicates their physical interpretation. in contrast, temporal fourier modes and dynamic mode decomposition (dmd) provide pure frequency dynamics but lose the orthonormality and optimality property of pod. sieber et al. (j. fluid mech., vol. 792, 2016, pp. 798-828) bridge the least residual and pure frequency behaviour with an ingenious interpolation, called spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (spod). this article puts the achievement of the tu berlin authors in perspective, illustrating the potential of spod and the challenges ahead.
immunology	dendritic cells (dcs) recognize foreign structures of different pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, via a variety of pattern recognition receptors (prrs) expressed on their cell surface and thereby activate and regulate immunity. the major function of dcs is the induction of adaptive immunity in the lymph nodes by presenting antigens via mhc i and mhc ii molecules to naive t lymphocytes. therefore, dcs have to migrate from the periphery to the lymph nodes after the recognition of pathogens at the sites of infection. for in vitro experiments or dc vaccination strategies, monocyte-derived dcs are routinely used. these cells show similarities in physiology, morphology, and function to conventional myeloid dendritic cells. they are generated by interleukin 4 (il-4) and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) stimulation of monocytes isolated from healthy donors. here, we demonstrate how monocytes are isolated and stimulated from anti-coagulated human blood after peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) enrichment by density gradient centrifugation. human monocytes are differentiated into immature dcs and are ready for experimental procedures in a non-clinical setting after 5 days of incubation.
thermodynamics	fluctuation conductivity is experimentally studied in the genuine critical region near the superconducting transition of yba2cu3o7-delta, yba2cu2.985fe o-0.015(7-delta) and y0.95ca0.05ba2cu3o7-delta single crystal samples. two fluctuation regimes where the electrical conductivity diverges as a power-law of the reduced temperature were systematically observed. in the first regime, farther from the critical temperature t-c, the transition behaves as predicted by the thermodynamics of the three dimensional-xy (3d-xy) universality class characteristic of a second-order phase transition. in the asymptotic regime closer to tc a power-law regime characterized by a much smaller exponent is observed. the smallest value ever reported for the fluctuation conductivity exponent in the high-t-c superconductors is obtained for the fe- and ca-doped systems. we suggest that the regime beyond 3d-xy is a crossover towards a weakly first-order transition induced by internal magnetic excitations.

molecular_biology	regulation of eukaryotic transcription in vivo occurs at distinct stages. previous research has identified many active or repressive transcription factors (tfs) and core transcription components and studied their functions in vitro and in vivo. nonetheless, how individual tfs act in concert to regulate mrna gene expression in a single cell remains poorly understood. direct observation of tf assembly and disassembly and various biochemical reactions during transcription of a single-copy gene in vivo is the ideal approach to study this problem. research in this area requires developing novel techniques for single-cell transcription imaging and integrating imaging studies into understanding the molecular biology of transcription. in the past decade, advanced cell imaging has enabled unprecedented capabilities to visualize individual tf molecules, to track single transcription sites, and to detect individual mrna in fixed and living cells. these studies have raised several novel insights on transcriptional regulation such as the ""hit-and-run"" model and transcription bursting that could not be obtained by in vitro biochemistry analysis. at this point, the key question is how to achieve deeper understandings or discover novel mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation by imaging transcription in single cells. meanwhile, further technical advancements are likely required for visualizing distinct kinetic steps of transcription on a single-copy gene in vivo. this review article summarizes recent progress in the field and describes the challenges and opportunities ahead.

immunology	a growing body of evidence indicates that lysozyme plays a significant role as an indicator for many diseases and a drug for treatment of infections, ulcers and to study the spatial conformation, enzyme kinetics, and molecular immunology. therefore, highly sensitive determination of lysozyme is necessary and vital in a wide variety of fields. in this work, we put forward a simple but effective strategy for colorimetric visualization of lysozyme based on iodide-responsive cu@au nanoparticles (cu@au nps) as well as the iodide-catalyzed h2o2-tmb (3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine) reaction system. colorimetric detection is applied because of its simplicity, fast response for analysis, high detection limit, low costs and practicality. in our strategy, iodide is applied for the reason that it can induce an obvious color change of the cu@au nanoparticles solution from gray to red, along with the change of morphologies of the cu@au nanoparticles from irregular to spherical. consequently, this phenomenon results in colorimetric signal variation of the iodide-catalytic h2o2-tmb system. what 's more, by quite simple biomolecule modification on the cu@au nanoparticles surface, an all-purpose colorimetric platform is established for the accurate detection of lysozyme, which could lead to the change of cu@au np concentration through molecular recognition. the results show that modified cu-au nps successfully achieved a simple, selective, visualized, and ultrasensitive detection of lysozyme with a linear range from 10(-7) to 10(-3) m and a detection limit of 60 nm.
northern_blotting	an improved method for southern dna and northem rna blotting using the mupide (r)-2 mini-gel system is described. we get sharp and clear bands in southern and northern blotting after only 30 min short gel electrophoresis instead of the several hours large gel electrophoresis of conventional methods. the high electrical voltage with a pulse-like current of the mupid (r)-2 mini-gel system also allows reduction of the amount of formaldehyde, a harmful reagent, from the gel running buffer in rna blotting. this minor modification of dna and rna blotting technique enables us to perform the complete experimental procedure more quickly economically in less space, than conventional southern and northern blotting, as well as using an extremely small amount of formaldehyde in rna blotting.

immunology	major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic t cells. during an adaptive immune response, mhc molecules are regulated by several mechanisms including lipopolysaccharide (lps) and interferon gamma (ifn-g). however, it is unclear whether the serine protease cathepsin g (catg), which is generally secreted by neutrophils at the site of inflammation, might regulate mhc i molecules. we identified catg, and to a higher extend catg and lactoferrin (lf), as an exogenous regulator of cell surface mhc i expression of immune cells and glioblastoma stem cells. in addition, levels of mhc i molecules are reduced on dendritic cells from catg deficient mice compared to their wild type counterparts. furthermore, cell surface catg on immune cells, including t cells, b cells, and nk cells triggers mhc i on thp-1 monocytes suggesting a novel mechanism for catg to facilitate intercellular communication between infiltrating cells and the respective target cell. subsequently, our findings highlight the pivotal role of catg as a checkpoint protease which might force target cells to display their intracellular mhc i: antigen repertoire.
southern_blotting	arthrobacter simplex 156 is a microorganism that is used for steroid drug biotransformation of cortisone acetate (ca) to prednisone acetate (pa). the enzyme 3-ketosteroid-a-(31)-dehydrogenase encoded by the ksdd gene plays an important role in the bioconversion process. to further improve the biotransformation efficiencies of the industrial strain, a genetic manipulation system for a. simplex 156 was developed. additional copies of the ksdd gene under the control of the cat promoter (from pxmj19) were transferred into the strain a. simplex 156 and integrated into the 16s rdna sites, yielding a series of recombinant strains. one of these recombinant strains, designated a. simplex m158, exhibited superior properties for ca biotransformation. at the substrate concentration of 83.6 g/l, the highest pa production of the recombinant strain reached 66.7 g/l, which is approximately 32.9 % higher than that of wild-type strains, and the incubation time for ca to pa bioconversion was reduced by 20 h. southern blotting analysis of the recombinant strain indicated two copies of deregulated ksdd genes were integrated into the 16s rdna sites, which means two of five 16s rrna operons were insertionally disrupted in the recombinant strain. however, the disruption of the two 16s rrna operons did not affect the growth rate of the recombinant strain, which survived and thrived under desired conditions. in addition, the new strain was genetically stable for more than 100 generations without the use of antibiotics for selection. these superior characteristics make the new strain more suitable than the wild-type strain for pa production.
immunology	modern microsurgical techniques have made possible a broad spectrum of novel means for the reconstruction of complex bone and soft tissue defects. these techniques, in combination with developments in transplant immunology, have led to successful hand and facial allotransplantation and achievement of the highest rung in the reconstructive ladder - truly replacing like with like. the utilization of contemporary microsurgical technique in the context of vascularized composite allotransplantation (vca) (1) permits successful technical execution and feasibility of vca, (2) facilitates the study of immunologic tolerance in vca preclinical models, and (3) optimizes functional vca outcomes.
internal_combustion_engine	electrified powertrains/propulsion systems have gained a significant interest in transport industry to develop energy-efficient vehicular systems. in these powertrains, rechargeable energy storage systems (such as high energy batteries, electrochemical double-layer capacitors or high power batteries), electric motors, energy management strategies and advanced power electronics converters play an important role in the development of new generations of clean vehicles. therefore, this paper proposes new drivetrain architectures for straddle truck carriers, as one of off-highway vehicles, which are used in harbors to move containers, in order to improve the straddle truck carriers drivetrain efficiency and to reduce the greenhouse emissions as well as the energy bills. the proposed drivetrains are: (1) series hybrid straddle truck carrier based on a small rechargeable energy storage system (option a), (2) series hybrid based on a reduced internal combustion engine (option b), (3) full electric drivetrain, and (4) new full electric drivetrain based on dynamic wireless-power transfer system. in this paper, an accurate quasi-static model of the conventional straddle truck carrier drivetrain is developed and described in detail. then, the proposed drivetrain architectures are designed and modeled using matlab/simulink. this article also presents the optimal design of rechargeable energy storage systems that can be utilized in those drivetrains. based on the rechargeable energy storage system type, a thorough comparative study of new straddle truck carrier drivetrains is described in detail. finally, the developed model and simulation results have been validated with real measurements of the drivetrain.

cell_biology	mitochondria have many different functions, the most important one of which is oxidative phosphorylation. they originated from an endosymbiotic event between a bacterium and an archaeal host cell. it was the evolution of a protein import system that marked the boundary between the endosymbiotic ancestor of the mitochondrion and a true organelle that is under the control of the nucleus. in present day mitochondria more than 95% of all proteins are imported from the cytosol in a proces mediated by hetero-oligomeric protein complexes in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. in this review we compare mitochondrial protein import in the best studied model system yeast and the parasitic protozoan trypanosoma brucei. the 2 organisms are phylogenetically only remotely related. despite the fact that mitochondrial protein import has the same function in both species, only very few subunits of their import machineries are conserved. moreover, while yeast has 2 inner membrane protein translocases, one specialized for presequence-containing and one for mitochondrial carrier proteins, t. brucei has a single inner membrane translocase only, that mediates import of both types of substrates. the evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed.
strength_of_materials	a closed-form solution for upper and lower bounds ( 'dual bounds') to a slow indentation of rigid ball (under increasing normal load) into rigid plastic solids are presented. the solutions enlarge the theoretical background to the familiar brinell hardness tests used in assessing strength of materials and add few new features. the new features are mainly: (i) constructing a lower-bound solution to ball indentation, (ii) a closed-form estimation of the dual bounds with any prescribed frictional shear along the indenter/solid contact, (iii) providing dual bounds to two different situations of the material response: (a) the removed material is falling off from the bulk (akin to indentation into brittle-like materials) and (b) the removed material is piled up along the indenter face (akin to indentation into ductile-like materials). the dual bound solutions of the indenting mean ball pressure for both material cases seem to capture properly well the material constrain to local plastic indentation and the effect of the interfacial friction. having both bounds simultaneously, despite their unavoidable deviation, provide much more informative results than a single bound. comparisons between the suggested bounding analysis and experiments (taken from tabor [tabor d. hardness of metals. oxford: clarendon press; 1951], johnson [johnson kl. contact mechanics. cambridge: cambridge university press; 1985 (new edition, 2001)] and others), numerical fem solutions (mesarovic and fleck [mesarovic sdj, fleck n. spherical indentation of elastic-plastic solids. proceedings of royal society of london 1999; a455: 2707-28] and others) and some self-made measurements are all favorable.

northern_blotting	the cdna encoding a protease of perinereis aibuhitensis grube (ppa) was cloned. the deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that the protein had 49% identity to the c-terminal amino acid 169-246 of serine protease of heterodera glycines. northern blotting analysis indicated that the cdna could hybridize with mrna of approximately 260 bases isolated from the marine earthworm. the cdna was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pmal-p2 to construct expression vector pmal-ppa. pmal-ppa was introduced into escherichia coli bl21(de3) and overexpression of ppa fused with maltose binding protein was achieved by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin column and ion-exchange chromatography on a diethylaminoethyl-sepharose 4b column. rabbits were immunized with the purified protein and antiserum was prepared. the antibody could react with a protein of approximately 9 kda extracted from the marine earthworm as shown by western blotting analysis. the activity analysis of the recombinant ppa suggested that it was probably a plasminogen activator.
molecular_biology	surface topography of titanium (ti) dental implants strongly influences osseointegration. in the present work, we have analyzed the influence of two ti implant surfaces characterized by similar microtopography but different nanotopography and chemistry on the osteoblastic phenotype of dental pulp stem cells (dpscs). the effect on osteogenic differentiation, extracellular matrix (ecm) and cell adhesion molecules production have been evaluated by means of molecular biology analyses. the morphology of the cells grown onto these surfaces has been analyzed with sem and immunofluorescence (if), and the safety of the surfaces has been tested by using karyotype analysis, ames test and hemocompatibility assay. results showed that starting from 15 days of dpscs culture, a substantial expression of osteoblast specific markers and a strong increase of cell adhesion molecules can be detected. in particular, when dpscs are seeded on the ti implants expression of microrna (mirna)-196a, which is involved in osteoblastic commitment of stem cells, and of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (vcam1), a factor involved in angiogenesis, is strongly enhanced.
molecular_biology	plant oil biosynthesis involves a complex metabolic network with multiple subcellular compartments, parallel pathways, cycles, and pathways that have a dual function to produce essential membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. modern molecular biology techniques provide tools to alter plant oil compositions through bioengineering, however with few exceptions the final composition of triacylglycerol cannot be predicted. one reason for limited success in oilseed bioengineering is the inadequate understanding of how to control the flux of fatty acids through various fatty acid modification, and triacylglycerol assembly pathways of the lipid metabolic network. this review focuses on the mechanisms of acyl flux through the lipid metabolic network, and highlights where uncertainty resides in our understanding of seed oil biosynthesis. this article is part of a special issue entitled: plant lipid biology edited by kent d. chapman and ivo feussner.

southern_blotting	cytogenetic and molecular investigations on the holocentric chromosomes of the aphid macrosiphum euphorbiae (thomas, 1878) have been carried out using silver staining and c-banding (followed by chromomycin a(3) and dapi staining) in order to improve our knowledge about the structure of aphid chromosomes. the c-banding pattern is peculiar since only the two x chromosomes and a single pair of autosomes presented heterochromatic bands. silver staining and fish with the 28s rdna probe localized the rdna genes on one telomere of each x chromosome that were also brightly fluorescent after chromomycin a(3) staining of c-banded chromosomes, whereas all other heterochromatic bands were dapi positive. interestingly, a remarkable nucleolar organizing region (nor) heteromorphism was present making the two x chromosomes easily distinguishable. southern blotting and fish assessed the presence of the (ttagg)(n) repeat at the ends of all the m euphorbiae chromosomes. karyotype analysis showed that all males possessed the x chromosome with the larger amount of rdna suggesting a non-mendelian inheritance of the two x chromosomes.
molecular_biology	in recent years, there have been particular emphases worldwide on the development and optimization of bioprocesses for the utilization of biomass. an essential component of the biomass processing conduit has been the need for robust biocatalysts as high-performance tools for both the depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass and synthesis of new high-value bio-based chemical entities. through functional screening of the metagenome of the hindgut bacterial symbionts of a termite, trinervitermes trinervoides, we discovered open reading frames for 25 cellulases and hemicellulases. these were classified into 14 different glycoside hydrolase (gh) families: eight gh family 5; four gh9, two gh13, and one each in gh2, gh10, gh11, gh26, gh29, gh43, gh44, gh45, gh67, and gh94 families. of these, eight were overexpressed and partially characterized to be shown to be endocellulases (gh5c, gh5e, gh5f, and gh5g), an exocellulase (gh5d), endoxylanases (gh5h and gh11), and an alpha-fucosidase (gh29). the gh11 (xyl1) was of particular interest as it was discovered to be a multimodular beta-1,4-xylanase, consisting of a catalytic domain and two carbohydrate-binding modules (cbms). the cbm functions to selectively bind insoluble xylan and increases the rate of hydrolysis. the primary structure of gh11 showed a classical catalytic dyad of glutamic acid residues that generally forms part of the active site in gh11 enzyme family. this endoxylanase was optimal at ph 6 and 50 degrees c, and generated xylobiose and xylotriose from various xylan sources, including beechwood, birchwood, and wheat arabinoxylan. the catalytic ability of gh11 against natural substrate (e.g., wheat arabinoxylan) renders gh11 as a potential useful biocatalyst in the effective dismantling of complex plant biomass architecture.

genetics	sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (sunds) is a perplexing disorder to both forensic pathologists and clinic physicians. clinical features of sunds survivors suggested that sunds is similar to brugada syndrome (brs). leucine-rich repeat containing 10 (lrrc10) gene was a newly identified gene linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease associated with sudden cardiac death. to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of genetic variants of lrrc10 gene in sunds and brs, the coding regions of lrrc10 were genetically screened in 113 sporadic sunds victims (from january 2005 to december 2015, 30.7 +/- 7.5 years) and ten brs patients (during january 2010 to december 2014, 38.7 +/- 10.3 years) using direct sanger sequencing. afterwards, lrrc10 missense variant carriers were screened for a panel of 80 genes known to be associated with inherited cardiac arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy using target-captured next-generation sequencing. in this study, an in silico-predicted malignant lrrc10 mutation p.e129k was detected in one sunds victim without pathogenic rare variant in a panel of 80 arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy-related genes. we also provided evidence to show that rare variant p.p69l might contribute to the genetic cause for one sunds victim and two brs family members. this is the first report of genetic screening of lrrc10 in chinese sunds victims and brs patients. lrrc10 may be a new susceptible gene for sunds, and lrrc10 variant was initially and genetically linked to brs-associated arrhythmia.
human_metabolism	adipose tissue is functionally composed of brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. the unique thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue results from expression of uncoupling protein 1 in the mitochondrial inner membrane. on the basis of recent findings that adult humans have functionally active brown adipose tissue, it is now recognized as playing a much more important role in human metabolism than was previously thought. more importantly, brown-like adipocytes can be recruited in white adipose tissue upon environmental stimulation and pharmacologic treatment, and this change is associated with increased energy expenditure, contributing to a lean and healthy phenotype. thus, the promotion of brown-like adipocyte development in white adipose tissue offers novel possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat obesity and related metabolic diseases. in this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the recruitment of brown-like adipocyte in white adipose tissue. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
molecular_biology	purpose of review the ebb and flow of genetic influence relative to the understanding of craniofacial and dental disorders has evolved into a tacit acceptance of the current genetic paradigm. this review explores the science behind craniofacial and dental disorders through the lens of recent past and current findings and using tooth agenesis as a model of advances in craniofacial genetics. recent findings contemporary studies of craniofacial biology takes advantage of the technological resources stemming from the genomic and post-genomic eras. emerging data highlights the role of key genes and the epigenetic landscape controlling these genes, in causing dentofacial abnormalities. we also report here a novel glu78fs msx1 mutation in one family segregating an autosomal dominant form of severe tooth agenesis as an illustration of an evolving theme, i.e., different mutations in the same gene can result in a spectrum of dentofacial phenotypic severity. summary the future of clinical therapeutics will benefit from advances in genetics and molecular biology that refine the genotype-phenotype correlation. indeed, the past century suggests a continued convergence of genetic science in the practice of clinical dentistry.
molecular_biology	the brown planthopper (bph), nilaparvata lugens (stal), is one of the major pests of rice throughout asia. extensive use of insecticides for suppressing n. lugens has resulted in the development of insecticide resistance leading to frequent control failures in the field. the aim of the present study was to evaluate resistance in the field populations of n. lugens from major rice growing states of south india to various insecticides. we also determined the activity of detoxifying enzymes (esterases [ests], glutathione s-transferases [gsts], and mixed-function oxidases [mfos]). moderate levels of resistance were detected in the field populations to acephate, thiamethoxam and buprofezin (resistance factors 1.05-20.92 fold, 4.52-14.99 fold, and 1.00-18.09 fold, respectively) as compared with susceptible strain while there were low levels of resistance to imidacloprid (resistance factor 1.23-6.70 fold) and complete sensitivity to etofenoprox (resistance factor 1.05-1.66 fold). est activities in the field populations were 1.06 to 3.09 times higher than the susceptible strain while for gst and mfo the ratios varied from 1.29 to 3.41 and 1.03 to 1.76, respectively. the est activity was found to be correlated to acephate resistance (r = 0.999, p 0.001). the high selection pressure of organophosphate, neonicotinoid, and insect growth regulator (igr) in the field is likely to be contributing for resistance in bph to multiple insecticides, leading to control failures. the results obtained will be beneficial to ipm recommendations for the use of effective insecticides against bph.
human_metabolism	purpose of review the purpose of this review is to highlight recent methodological advances that have helped us to understand the role of intramuscular triglycerides in human health as well as prevention and treatment of disease. in addition to both invasive (muscle biopsy) and noninvasive methods, techniques to assess other lipids within muscle will be reviewed. recent findings in addition to intramuscular triglycerides, other lipids contained within skeletal muscle such as diacylglycerol and ceramides may have an important role in human metabolic disease. both ex-vivo and in-vivo methods to obtain serial measurements of these muscle lipids as a result of experimental perturbation have recently provided unique insight into their respective roles in human metabolism. summary triglyceride accumulation within skeletal muscle has received considerable interest due to its potential role in insulin resistance and fatty acid metabolism of obesity, aging and type 2 diabetes. observations that triglycerides themselves may be used as a fuel source for exercising muscle, and thus may not be detrimental in all circumstances, has in part prompted the development and implementation of analytical methods to quantify the fatty acid composition of muscle triglycerides as well as other lipid species within muscle, e.g. diacylglycerol and ceramides. in addition, noninvasive computed tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging methods have been applied to examine the serial effects of intervention on muscle triglycerides.
southern_blotting	the rainbow trout gastroenteritis (rtge) syndrome is affecting progressively more sites in various european countries causing significant economical losses for the rainbow trout industries. as candidatus arthromitus, a not yet culturable bacteria, is the microorganism responsible for the rtge, molecular methods have been identified as an important tool for the identification of this microorganism. an early, fast and specific detection of c. arthromitus using specific primers and probes, are important goals for the aquaculture sector. in the present study were used: a polymerase chain reaction (pcr), using universal primers annealing the 16s rrna gene, to obtain amplification products representatives of the microbiota present in the intestinal content of trouts, including c. arthromitus when present; a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to produce dna finger printings corresponding to the microbiota present in the intestinal contents of each trout analysed; a specific dna probe designed within the 16s rdna that was used both in dot blot and southern blot techniques to detect the unculturable bacterium c. arthromitus. dot blot applied directly onto dna extracted from the intestinal contents allowed a fast identification of the samples containing c arthromitus. southern blotting allowed the identification of the specific dna band corresponding to c. arthromitus among the various dna bands obtained by the utilisation of the universal primers and run in dgce. molecular methods such as dot blot and southern blot are useful methods for a fast identification of the unculturable c. arthromitus.

northern_blotting	pcd (programmed cell death) is important mechanism for development, homeostasis and disease. to analyze the gene expression pattern in brain cells undergoing pcd in response to serum deprivation, we analyzed the cdna microarray consisting of 2,300 genes and 7 housekeeping genes of cortical cells derived from mouse embryonic brain. cortical cells were induced apoptosis by serum deprivation.for 8 hours. we identified 69 up-regulated genes and 21 down-regulated genes in apoptotic cells. based on the cdna microarray data four genes were selected and analyzed by rt-pcr and northern blotting. to characterize the role of unc-51-like kinase (ulk2) gene in pcd, we investigated cell death effect by ulk2. and we examined expression of several genes that related with pcd. especially gapdh was increased by ulk2. theses findings indicated that ulk2 is involved in apoptosis through p53 pathway.
enzymology	as with natural nucleic acids, pairing between artificial nucleotides can be influenced by tautomerism, with different placements of protons on the heterocyclic nucleobase changing patterns of hydrogen bonding that determine replication fidelity. for example, the major tautomer of isoguanine presents a hydrogen bonding donor donor acceptor pattern complementary to the acceptor acceptor donor pattern of 5-methylisocytosine. however, in its minor tautomer, isoguanine presents a hydrogen bond donor acceptor donor pattern complementary to thymine. calculations, crystallography, and physical organic experiments suggest that this tautomeric ambiguity might be ""fixed"" by replacing the n-7 nitrogen of isoguanine by a ch unit. to test this hypothesis, we prepared the triphosphate of 2'-deoxy-7-deazaiso-guanosine and used it in pcr to estimate an effective tautomeric ratio ""seen"" by taq dna polymerase. with 7-deazaisoguanine, fidelity-per-round was similar to 92%. the analogous pcr with isoguanine gave a lower fidelity-per-round of similar to 86%. these results confirm the hypothesis with polymerases, and deepen our understanding of the role of minor groove hydrogen bonding and proton tautomerism in both natural and expanded genetic ""alphabets"", major targets in synthetic biology.
manufacturing_engineering	this paper presents a methodology to generate manufacturing routes and operations using rules of precedence to provide logical approach in their dimensioning and chaining. the rules of precedence order and prioritize the knowledge of various manufacturing processes, taking into account the theories of machining, forging, assembly, and heat treatments; also, utilizes the theories of accumulation of tolerance and process capability, between others. the proposed methodology requires development of manufacturing data bases of manufacturing process, tolerances and capabilities, deviations of the machine tool - cutting tool - fixture device and work piece. the rules of precedence make viable the generation of manufacturing routings and operations, through the usage of structured knowledge, instead of tacit one. this approach allows the structured development of manufacturing routes, which can be deployed to engineers working in the areas of manufacturing engineering.
internal_combustion_engine	the main design criteria for the modern sustainable development of vehicle powertrains are the high energy efficiency of the conversion system, the competitive cost and the lowest possible environmental impacts. the need for efficiency improvement of the vehicle energy system induces the search for an innovative methodology during the design process. in this article the energy services for mobility and comfort are integrated. the energy integration of the mobility and the comfort service is applied through an innovative methodology combining process integration techniques. the methodology is applied on the energy integration study of a hybrid electric vehicle powertrain with the vehicle cabin. the energy balance of the internal combustion engine is done and discussed, according to the operating points. the energy requirement for comfort in the cabin is also determined, according to the seasonal requirement for heating or cooling. work cycles for heat recovery are described and investigated. the minimum energy requirement is determined for different mobility and comfort situations. the energy recovery potential of a single stage rankine cycle for a diesel engine in combination with a hybrid electric powertrain is assessed. the rankine cycle circuit and equipment are simultaneously presided.
internal_combustion_engine	organic rankine cycles (orc) using toluene and hexamethyldisiloxane (mm) are put forward as a means of improving the efficiency of automotive heavy duty engines, and provide a reference for comparison in this study. despite an efficiency improvement potential of 4-4.7%, the current orc approach is not reaching the required fuel savings within the expected costs. as such, innovative pathways to improve the orc performance and cost-effectiveness are of great importance to the research community. this paper presents a partial solution by means of a conceptual overview and simulation results for orcs especially tailored for high-temperature applications. a fundamental revision of the heat transfer and expansion characteristics is presented, without increasing the system integration complexity. these characteristics are attributed to the use of formulated organic blends with toluene and mm as a significant blend component. the developed 22 criteria blend screening methodology is presented. simulation results show that for an equivalent expansion volume flow ratio, and product of heat transfer coefficient and area, the blends offer a 22-24% improvement in the net power. this resulted in a 15-18% cost savings compared to the reference orc. the simulations were conducted in aspen hysys v8 using the peng-robinson and wilson fluid property packages.

machine_design	the main objective of this paper is to develop a new technique for detecting turn-to-turn short-circuit faults in one or two stator phases of an induction motor. hence, modeling a turn-to-turn short-circuit fault in more than one phase and a phase-to-ground fault is the first novelty of this paper for calculating phase currents under faulty conditions. this strategy uses the extracted features from the corresponding three-phase current pattern in 3-d space. identification of faulty phases and of the severity of the fault is the outcome of this technique. this technique is also capable of detecting a phase-to-ground fault. this method just requires current sensors that are available in most drive systems to provide good controllability, and details of the machine design are not necessary. experimental results are included to show the ability of the proposed strategy for detecting and locating phase/phases under different faults and load conditions.
internal_combustion_engine	this chapter deals with the numerical simulation of the exhaust of an engine, passing through a pipe of 100 mm long and 30 mm diameter. the velocity and temperature profiles along with the concentration of exhaust gases are plotted along the axial length of the pipe. further, a coaxial surface junction thermocouple (10 mm long and 3.25 mm diameter) is placed at an appropriate location of the pipe and the flow field is reinvestigated. in both the cases, the lateral variation of temperature and velocity, are found to be negligible. but, the composition of exhaust gas changes beyond an axial length of 20 mm which may be possibly due to chemical reaction of exhaust gases with ambient air. one of the important objectives of this simulation is to estimate a desired axial location of the thermocouple for a proposed experiment. based on the simulated results, it found that the thermocouple can be mounted at any axial location between 0-20 mm from the inlet of exhaust pipe.
internal_combustion_engine	big-end bearing knock faults in ic engines can be considered as a real industrial case of a slider-crank mechanism including a joint with clearance and lubrication. in this paper, an artificial neural network (ann) based system was used to solve the problem of intelligent big-end bearing knock fault diagnosis in internal combustion (ic) engine. but when the ann is used in machine condition monitoring, it is either unlikely or uneconomical to experience all different real faults to generate sufficient training data. therefore, model based method should be a viable way to generate adequate data to train the networks for the intelligent big-end bearing fault diagnosis in ic engines. in order to evaluate and update the simulation model, experiments with normal bearing clearance and with different oversize bearing clearances were first carried out on the engine test rig. it was found that the relevant diagnostic information lies in the squared envelope of the vibration signals. therefore, we only need build a proper simulation model to simulate the correct envelope signals rather than the raw vibration signals. as the important inputs of the simulation model, the inertia properties of the simulated engine components were also measured and studied. next, we built an ann-based bearing knock diagnosis system which consists of three phases: fault detection phase, fault localization phase and fault severity identification phase. particularly, a saturating linear function is selected as the transfer function of the fault severity identification stage, so the networks can linearly classify the fault levels and the output is more in agreement with the reality in industry. following the feature extraction and selection from the processed squared envelope signals, the networks were purely trained by the simulated data with normal bearing clearance and with different oversize bearing clearances. finally the networks was tested by the real experimental data and it was demonstrated that the networks can successfully detect different bearing knock faults in real tests, and also classify the faults' location and severity levels.

immunology	the evolutionarily conserved protein kinase p38 mediates innate resistance to environmental stress and microbial infection. four p38 isoforms exist in mammals and may have been co-opted for new roles in adaptive immunity. murine t cells deficient in p38, the ubiquitously expressed p38 isoform, showed no readily apparent cell-autonomous defects while expressing elevated amounts of another isoform, p38. mice with t cells simultaneously lacking p38 and p38 displayed lymphoid atrophy and elevated foxp3(+) regulatory t cell frequencies. double deficiency of p38 and p38 in naive cd4(+) t cells resulted in an attenuation of mapk-activated protein kinase (mk)-dependent mtor signaling after t cell receptor engagement, and enhanced their differentiation into regulatory t cells under appropriate inducing conditions. pharmacological inhibition of the p38-mk-mtor signaling module produced similar effects, revealing potential for therapeutic applications.
machine_design	ultra-precision manufacturing (upm) machines are used to fabricate and measure complex parts having micrometer-level features and nanometer-level tolerances/surface finishes. therefore, random vibration of the machine due to ground excitations and residual vibration stemming from onboard disturbances must be mitigated using vibration isolation systems. a long-standing rule of thumb in vibration isolation system design is to locate the isolators in such a way that the vibration modes of the isolated machine are decoupled. however, prior work by the authors has demonstrated that coupling vibration modes of passively-isolated upm machines could provide conditions for drastic reduction of residual vibrations compared to decoupling. the authors' analysis was based on the restrictive assumption that the isolated machine was modally damped. the key contribution of this paper is in investigating the effect of mode coupling on the residual vibrations of upm machines with non-proportional (np) damping which is more realistic than modal damping. it also analyzes the effects of mode coupling on the reduction of ground vibrations (i.e., transmissibility). the analyses reveal that, even though np damping changes the vibration behavior of the machine compared to modal damping, mode coupling still provides ample opportunities to reduce residual vibration and transmissibility. guidelines for properly designing a upm machine to best exploit mode coupling for vibration reduction are provided and validated through simulations and experiments. up to 40% reduction in residual vibration and 50% reduction in transmissibility are demonstrated.

molecular_biology	tripterygium wilfordii hook. f. is one of the most valuable medicinal plants because it contains a large variety of active terpenoid compounds, including triptolide, celastrol, and wilforlide. all of the pharmacologically active secondary metabolites are synthesized from the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate and mevalonate pathway in the isoprenoid biosynthetic system. the key step in this pathway is the isomerization of dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate, which is catalyzed by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (ipi). in the present study, a full-length cdna encoding ipi (designate as twipi, genbank accession no. kt279355) was cloned from a suspension of cultured cells from t. wilfordii. the full-length cdna of twipi was 1,564 bp and encoded a polypeptide of 288 amino acids. the bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced twipi sequence contained the tntccshpl and wgeheldy motif. the transcription level of the twipi in the suspension cells increased almost fivefold after treatment with methyl jasmonate as an elicitor. a functional color assay in escherichia coli indicated that twipi could promote the accumulation of lycopene and encoded a functional protein.

cell_biology	neural progenitor cells have a central role in the development and evolution of the vertebrate brain. during early brain development, neural progenitors first expand their numbers through repeated proliferative divisions and then begin to exhibit neurogenic divisions. the transparent and experimentally accessible optic tectum of xenopus laevis is an excellent model system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis, but the precise spatial and temporal relationship between proliferative and neurogenic progenitors has not been explored in this system. here we construct a spatial map of proliferative and neurogenic divisions through lineage tracing of individual progenitors and their progeny. we find a clear spatial separation of proliferative and neurogenic progenitors along the anterior-posterior axis of the optic tectum, with proliferative progenitors located more posteriorly and neurogenic progenitors located more anteriorly. since individual progenitors are repositioned toward more anterior locations as they mature, this spatial separation likely reflects an increasing restriction in the proliferative potential of individual progenitors. we then examined whether the transition from proliferative to neurogenic behavior correlates with cellular properties that have previously been implicated in regulating neurogenesis onset. our data reveal that the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis is associated with a small change in cleavage plane orientation and a more pronounced change in cell cycle kinetics in a manner reminiscent of observations from mammalian systems. our findings highlight the potential to use the optic tectum of xenopus laevis as an accessible system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis.

machine_design	the aim of this paper is to discuss electrical machines building and computation while taking into account the change of reluctance network (rn) topology required in an optimization process. indeed, as electrical machine rn changes during an electrical period, this model has to consider several rotor positions to analyze harmonic influence on machine performance (e.g., its torque and losses). such a requirement can also be important in applications where machine geometry changes shortly during sizing process by optimization. these two cases are addressed in this paper. using established independent meshes of the initial rn, this paper proposes an algorithm to deal with all topologies necessary for an optimization process. this aims to reduce the computation time, increase the model, and improve the solving stability. an output selectivity approach is also applied on the rn modeling to improve the computation time of the optimization process. the simulation results are compared to finite-element methods and the optimization performance is presented.
southern_blotting	we describe a method for synchronization of the cell cycle in the bacterium escherichia coli. treatment of asynchronous cultures with the amino acid analog, dl-serine hydroxamate, induces the stringent response, with concomitant arrest of dna replication at initiation. following release of the stringent response, cells initiate dna replication in synchrony, as determined by flow cytometry for dna content, southern blotting and microscopy. this method has the advantage that it can be used in fully wild-type cells, at different growth rates, and may be applicable to other bacterial species with replication control by the stringent response. we also elaborate other methods useful for establishing cell cycle parameters in bacterial populations. we describe flow cytometric methods for analyzing bacterial populations for dna content using the dna-specific dye picogreen, readily detected by most commercial flow cytometers. we also present an method for incorporation of the nucleotide ethynyl-deoxyuridine, edu, followed by ""click"" labeling with fluorescent dyes, which allows us to measure and visualize newly replicated dna in fixed e. coli k-12 cells under non-denaturing conditions.

thermodynamics	adsorption is a widely used technique for the removal of dyes from wastewaters by variety of adsorbents. in this work, the main focus is on the potential assessment of anion exchange membrane for the removal of different dyes using batch system and investigation of experimental data by applying various kinetic and thermodynamic models. the removal of anionic dyes i.e., eosin-b, eriochrome black-t and congo red by anion exchange membrane bii from aqueous solution was carried out and effect of various parameters such as contact time, membrane dosage, temperature and ionic strength on the percentage removal of anionic dyes was studied. the experimental data was assessed by kinetic models namely pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, elovich liquid film diffusion, bangham and the modified freundlich models equation have been used to analyze the experimental data. these results indicate that the adsorption of these anionic dyes on bii follows pseudo-second-order kinetics with maximum values of regression coefficient (0.992-0.998) for all the systems. the adsorption of dyes was more suitable to be controlled by a liquid film diffusion mechanism. the adsorptive removal of dye eosin-b and eriochrome black-t were decreased with temperature and thermodynamic parameters such as free energy (delta g degrees), enthalpy (delta h degrees) and entropy (delta s degrees) for adsorption of dyes on membrane bii were calculated at 298 k, 308 k and 318 k. the values of enthalpy and entropy were negative for eb and ebt representing that the adsorption of these dyes on bii is physiosorptive and exothermic in nature. whereas the positive values of enthalpy and entropy for cr adsorption on bii, indicating that its adsorption is endothermic and spontaneous in nature. it is evident from this study that anion exchange membrane has shown good potential for the removal of dyes from aqueous solution and it can be used as adsorbent for dues removal on commercial levels.
southern_blotting	in this study, we cloned and sequenced a 938-base pair polymorphic band, phs27, in the tightly linked random amplified polymorphic dna marker opu10 and converted it into a sequence-characterized amplified region (scar) marker referred to as rhs141, which was specific for the ns genome of psathyrostachys huashanica. a genbank basic local alignment search tool search showed that the sequence of phs27 had no primary sequence homology with known sequences, and southern blotting confirmed this result. this scar marker was used to detect ns genome chromatin in wheat, and it was successfully amplified in p. huashanica itself, a complete set of wheat-p. huashanica disomic addition lines (1ns-7ns), and undetermined homoeologous group addition lines. this scar marker will be a powerful tool for the marker-assisted selection of p. huashanica chromosome(s) in a wheat background, and it should also allow wheat breeders to screen for the excellent traits found in p. huashanica chromatin.
enzymology	protein phosphorylation is one of the major pathways used by eukaryotic cells to propagate signals to the final effectors, regulating multiple aspects of the living cell, such as metabolism, growth, differentiation, adhesion, motility, genome stability and death. in this context, tyrosine kinases (tks) play a central role in signal transduction and their overexpression or disregulated activity has been implicated in tumor onset and malignancy progression. to date, eight tks inhibitors have been approved by fda for the treatment of specific tumors. in spite of their efficacy, insurgence of resistance is a common feature after prolonged administration. the selective pressure by these drugs, in fact, induces clonal expansion of subsets of cancer cells harboring tks mutations, leading to decreased inhibition potency. alternatively, resistance to tk inhibitors can be acquired through the activation of others, often unrelated, tks. for this reason, while stringent target selectivity of tks inhibitors has been always considered a desirable feature in order to limit toxicity, molecules targeting different tks have been recently shown to be promising anti-cancer agents as well. understanding the molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to tk inhibitors, through a combination of enzymatic, structural and cellular studies, is essential in the development of second generation inhibitors active also towards drug resistant tumors.
molecular_biology	the disciplinary structure of research on complex problems related to human activities is supported by the fundaments of the social, life, and hard sciences. in this work, we looked at the development of scientific research in the field of biofuels, as a sustainable source of energy, searching for references regarding its scientific roots and social relevance. scientific communications on biofuels published between 1998 and 2007 were analyzed using a combination of bibliometric methods and text mining techniques. this field of research was characterized as interdisciplinary, with marked social relevance. our bibliometric analysis shows that, in this research subject, 132 different, interacting fields of knowledge overlap, with dominance of chemistry, engineering and agricultural sciences. through the use of text mining techniques, this field was configured into three groups of disciplinary dimensions. the first and most influential group includes the agricultural sciences, social sciences, and environmental sciences. the second group, which gives the field its technological basis, includes chemistry, engineering, and microbiology. the third group includes disciplines with emerging involvement in the field of biofuels: biology and biochemistry, animal and plant sciences, molecular biology and genetics, economics, material sciences, nanosciences and nanotechnology, geosciences, physics, humanities, multidisciplinary sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences. this study suggests that the first group of disciplinary dimensions conforms to the elements that socially validate the progress of research in the field of biofuels. this study also proposes a metric that can be used to measure the interdisciplinarity and the social framing of any other research field.
polymerase_chain_reaction	xp11 translocation renal cell carcinomas (rcc) are characterized by several different translocations involving the tfe3 gene. tumors with different specific gene fusions may have different clinicopathologic manifestations. only 3 rbm10tfe3 rccs have been reported to date. here, we added 4 cases of this rare type of tumors with clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, molecular, and ultrastructural analyses. most tumors had similar patterns with mixed architectures as follows: acinar, tubular and papillary patterns of epithelioid cells combined with sheets of small cells with ""pseudorosettelike"" architectures, mimicking the typical morphology of t(6;11) rcc. cytoplasmic vacuolization, nuclear groove, and psammoma bodies were observed in most cases. immunohistochemically, all 4 cases demonstrated moderate to strong immunoreactivity for tfe3, cathepsin k, cd10, ksp-cadherin, e-cadherin, p504s, rcc marker, pax8 and vimentin, whereas negativity for tfeb, hmb45, and ck7. ckpan and melan-a were at least focally expressed. the antibody to ki-67 showed labeling of 3% to 8% (mean, 5%) of tumor cell nuclei. ;of interest, several immunostainings demonstrated expression discrepancy in different histology patterns. rbm10-tfe3 fusion transcripts were identified in all cases by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. by fluorescence in situ hybridization, all 4 cases showed unusual split signals with a distance <1 signal diameter (co-localized or subtle split signals) and usually had false-negative results. we also observed ultrastructures, including melanin pigment, nuclear groove, numerous glycogens, mitochondrion with areas of high electron density material, basement membrane material, and cell junctions with poor development. all 4 patients were alive with no evidence of recurrent disease. our report adds to the known data regarding rbm10-tfe3 rcc.
southern_blotting	the object of the current work was to study low energy ar+ ion beam interactions with silkworm eggs and thus provide further understanding of the mechanisms involved in ion bombardment-induced direct gene transfer into silkworm eggs. in this paper, using low-energy ar+ ion beam bombardment combined with piggybac transposon, we developed a novel method to induce gene transfer in silkworm. using bombardment conditions optimized for egg-incubation (25 key with ion fluences of 800 x 2.6 x 10(15) ions/cm(2) in dry state under vacuum), vector pbac{3 x p3-egfpaf} and helper plasmid pha3pig were successfully transferred into the silkworm eggs. our results obtained from by pcr assay and genomic southern blotting analysis of the g1 generations provide evidence that low-energy ion beam can generate some craters that play a role in acting as pathways of exogenous dna molecules into silkworm eggs.

northern_blotting	lanzhou lily (lilium davidii var. unicolor) with symptoms of severe fasciation or dwarfing was observed in the central region of gansu province, and the disease caused a serious loss in production of the bulb edible crop. in order to determine possible virus infections involved in the described disease, a set of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoelectron microscopy had been performed to test the naturally infected plants. a mixed infection which includes lily symptomless virus (lsv: flexiviridae, carlavirus), cucumber mosaic virus (cmv: bromoviridae, cucumovirus) and lily mottle virus (lmov: potyviridae; potyvirus) has been confirmed by serologic and morphologic evidences. the subsequent thin sectioning observation with a transmission electron microscope on different tissues from infected samples showed that cytopathologic damages happened. total rna extracted from different tissues of infected plants was used in the northern-blotting assays with probes of coat protein gene of each virus, then hybridization data showed a symptomatic infection of related virus. thus, the study gives reliable serologic, morphologic, cytopathologic and molecular evidences for the diagnosis of the systemic infections. this study is hoped to be useful in prevention of certain viral diseases and to increase the quality and production of this crop in the future.
northern_blotting	caffeine biosynthesis involves sequential methylation of the purine ring by the transfer of methyl group from the methyl donor s-adenosyl methionine. genes that code for the individual methyl transferase have a high degree of sequence homology. to achieve decaffeination by genetic engineering of coffee, the effect and efficiency of different post-transcriptional gene silencing (ptgs) constructs were evaluated. sense, antisense and invert repeat constructs were developed using a 339 bp fragment from the conserved region of the coffee n-methyltransferase genes involved in caffeine biosynthesis. the silencing constructs were mobilized into agrobacterium tumefaciens (eha101). sonication assisted agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the somatic embryos of c. canephora was performed, followed by regeneration of the transformants. molecular analysis and identification of flanking regions confirmed the stable integration of the transgenes in the transformants and their integration in non coding regions of the genome, respectively. effectiveness of the silencing constructs was evaluated by transcript analysis of the targeted genes by rt-pcr and northern blotting. the silencing efficiency was further evaluated by estimation of the purine alkaloid content in the transgenic lines using hplc. the three constructs differed in their silencing efficiencies and specificity. though the constructs were not specific to a single n-methyltransferase, transformants obtained were mainly affected in one of the n-methyltransferases. results show that the use of homologous coding sequence in the ptgs constructs results in a much higher efficiency in silencing the caffeine biosynthetic pathway. further, the lowering of caffeine content should be the preferred over complete decaffeination due to extremely low survival rate of transgenic plants with extremely low levels of caffeine.
fluid_mechanics	the california sea lion (zalophus californianus), is an agile and powerful swimmer. unlike many successful swimmers (dolphins, tuna), they generate most of their thrust with their large foreflippers. this protocol describes a robotic platform designed to study the hydrodynamic performance of the swimming california sea lion (zalophus californianus). the robot is a model of the animal 's foreflipper that is actuated by motors to replicate the motion of its propulsive stroke (the 'clap'). the kinematics of the sea lion 's propulsive stroke are extracted from video data of unmarked, non-research sea lions at the smithsonian zoological park (snz). those data form the basis of the actuation motion of the robotic flipper presented here. the geometry of the robotic flipper is based a on high-resolution laser scan of a foreflipper of an adult female sea lion, scaled to about 60% of the full-scale flipper. the articulated model has three joints, mimicking the elbow, wrist and knuckle joint of the sea lion foreflipper. the robotic platform matches dynamics properties-reynolds number and tip speed-of the animal when accelerating from rest. the robotic flipper can be used to determine the performance (forces and torques) and resulting flowfields.
machine_design	the purpose of the work is innovative rhombus briquetting mechanism model development. mechanism model simulation is a tool for the transition from the prototype to the real machine design. for simulation working model 2d software was used. the working model 2d software is capable of modelling the motion of rigid bodies that may be connected by a variety of joints and constraints. for simulation result evaluation energy consumption for pressing cycles was determined as 2.6 kj for laboratory experiment and 2.5 kj for simulation. difference in the energy consumption results is 4 % for 6.5 grams briquette pressing.
northern_blotting	phytoene synthase (psy), as a key regulatory enzyme for carotene biosynthesis, plays an important role in regulating color formation in many species. in the present study, a protocol was developed for the transformation of narcissus tazzeta var chinensis using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba4404 harboring a binary vector pcambia1301 plasmid which contained an antisense phytoene synthase gene, a reporter beta-glucuronidase gene and a selectable marker hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. effects of some factors on efficiency of transformation and regeneration were examined. preculture of the explants for 6 days before inoculation enhanced the transient gus expression. the addition of acetosyringone (as) at 100 mu mol l(-1) stop for inoculation and a period of 3 days co-cultivation yielded efficient transient gus expression. transformants were obtained through selection on ms medium containing 5 mg l(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine(ba), 0.1 mg l(-1) alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (naa) and 40 mg l(-1) hygromycin (.) under bar the transformation frequency was 1.24% based on pcr analysis of gus gene. one or two copies of transgene were demonstrated in different transformations by southern blotting analyses. northern blotting results confirmed that the transcription of the endogenous psy gene in transgenic plants was inhibited or silenced. the method reported here provides new opportunities for improvement of quality traits of narcissus tazzeta via genetic transformation.
computer-aided_design	a compact model of amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide thin-film transistors, suitable for cad simulators, is proposed. the model is simple, symmetric, and accurately accounts for the subthreshold, linear, and saturation regimes via a unique formulation. it accounts for both trapped and free charges by means of multiple-trapping-and-release and percolation in the conduction band. aim of the paper is to work out the analytic expression of the current and of the terminal charges, along with the surface potential and the electric field as a function of position in the channel. the availability of the surface potential and of the electric field is the key to model advanced physical effects as, for example, the carrier injection from the electrodes into the channel.
thermodynamics	cellulose and chitosan have intrinsic sorption properties for nd(iii); however, their efficiency for metal recovery can be easily improved by a relatively simple chemical modification. the grating of aspartic acid via an intermediary chlorination step of the polysaccharides allows increasing sorption capacities due to the specific reactivity of carboxylate groups. the grafting process is confirmed by elemental analysis, ftir spectrometry, while the physical properties of the derivatives are characterized by xrd (crystallinity) and tga (thermogravimetric analysis). the sorption properties are carried out by investigating the effect of the ph, studying the uptake kinetics and evaluating the thermodynamics (sorption isotherms). the sorption properties of modified sorbents are systematically compared to the performance of raw materials. sorption capacity is doubled after grafting aspartic acid onto biopolymer backbone. sorption isotherms are described by the freundlich and the langmuir equation and maximum sorption capacities reach up to 77-80 mg nd g(-1) at ph 5. the uptake kinetics are described by the pseudo-first order reaction rate and under selected experimental conditions the equilibrium is reached within 3 h of contact. the sorption is spontaneous, endothermic. metal desorption can be successfully performed with 0.5 m nitric acid and the sorbents can be recycled for at least 4 sorption/desorption cycles without significant loss in sorption/desorption performances.

thermodynamics	the electrochemical properties of sn-m (m = cu, mg and fe) bi-alloy nanoparticles prepared by dc arc-discharge method have been studied when these nanoparticles serve as the anode materials in li-ion batteries (libs). among all the alloy electrodes, the sn-fe electrode has the best initial specific capacity that maintains at about 227.3 mah g(-1) within 20 cycles. the intermetallic compounds in the nanoparticles have been characterized and thermodynamics analysis is introduced to elucidate the energy balance of their formation mechanism. as the electrochemical behaviours of the various alloy nanoparticles are different, we conclude that the present intermetallic compounds eventually determine the lithium-ion storage ability as well as the cyclic stability during the lithiation/delithiation process.

hydraulics	nuclear thermal rocket (ntr) propulsion is a viable and meritorious option for human exploration into deep-space because of its high thrust, improved specific impulse, well established technology, bimodal capability, and enhanced mission safety and reliability. the ntr technology has already been investigated and tested by the united states of america and russia and the former soviet union. the representative nuclear engine for rocket vehicle applications (nerva) type reactors traditionally used highly enriched uranium (heu) fuels, shaped in hexagonal fuel element geometries because of the importance of making a high power reactor with a minimum size. although the heu-ntr designs are the best choice in terms of rocket performance and technical maturity, they inevitably provoke nuclear proliferation obstacles not only for all research and development activities by civilians and non-nuclear weapon states but also for potential commercialization. to overcome the security issues due to heu, the non proliferative, small-size ntr engine with low thrust levels of 41 kn-53 kn (9.2 klb(f) similar to 11.9 klb(f)), korea advanced nuclear thermal engine rocket utilizing a low-enriched uranium fuel (kanuter-leu), is being designed for future generations. its design goals are to make use of an leu fuel for its fairly compact core, but to minimize the rocket performance sacrifice relative to the traditional heu-ntrs. to achieve these goals, a new space propulsion reactor is conceptually designed with the key concepts of a high uranium density fuel with resistance against high heating and h-2 corrosion, a thermal neutron spectrum core, and a compact and integrated fuel element core design with protective cooling capability. in addition, a preliminary design study of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics was performed to explore the design space of the new leu-ntr reactor concept. the result indicates that the innovative reactor concept has great potential, both to implement the use of an leu fuel and to create comparable rocket performance, compared to the existing heu-ntr designs.

enzymology	in recent decades, a number of hypotheses on the autotrophic origin of life have been presented. these proposals invoke the emergence of reaction networks leading from co or co2 to the organic molecules required for life. it has also been suggested that the last (universal) common ancestor (lca or luca) of all extant cell lineages was a chemolitho-autotrophic thermophilic anaerobe. the antiquity of some carbon fixation pathways, the phylogenetic basal distribution of some autotrophic organisms, and the catalytic properties of iron-sulfur minerals have been advanced in support of these ideas. here we critically examine the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of enzymes that are essential for two of the most ancient autotrophic means of metabolism: the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rtca) cycle and the reductive acetyl-coa pathway. phylogenetic analysis of citryl-coa synthetase and of citryl-coa lyase, key enzymatic components of the rtca cycle, and of co dehydrogenase/acetyl-coa synthase, a key enzyme in the reductive acetyl-coa pathway, revealed that all three enzymes have undergone major lateral transfer events and therefore cannot be used as proof of the lca 's metabolic abilities nor as evidence of an autotrophic origin of life.
immunology	rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and multiple inflammatory cytokines are involved in ra pathogenesis. interleukin (il)-18, in particular, has a significant positive correlation with ra. in this study, we investigated the effect of erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (erdr1), which is negatively regulated by il-18, in an animal model of inflammatory arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (cia) in dba/1j mice. treatment of mice with recombinant (r) erdr1 significantly suppressed the severity of arthritis, histologic features of arthritic tissue, and serum levels of anti-collagen autoantibodies (igg, igg1, igg2a and igm) in cia. in addition, il-18 expression was reduced in the affected synovium of rerdr1-treated mice. interestingly, erdr1 treatment suppressed migration in contrast to the pro-migratory effect of il-18, indicating the therapeutic effects of erdr1 on cia through inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration. in addition, erdr1 inhibited activation of erk1/2, a key signaling pathway in migration of various cell types. taken together, these data show that rerdr1 exerts therapeutic effects on ra by inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration, suggesting that rerdr1 treatment might be an effective therapeutic approach for ra.
polymerase_chain_reaction	canine brucellosis caused by brucella canis is a neglected zoonosis worldwide and is a leading cause of reproductive failure in dogs, often causing substantial economic losses in breeding kennels. this study aimed to investigate the occurrence of b.canis infection in dogs of commercial breeding kennels located in sao paulo state, brazil. a total of 753 dogs (183 males and 570 females) from 38 commercial kennels were clinically examined, and blood samples were collected for brucellosis diagnosis through blood culture. the association between clinical manifestations suggestive of brucellosis and positive results through blood culture was determined. of the 753 dogs tested, 166 (22.0%) had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis and 158 (20.9%) had positive blood cultures. seventy-two dogs had positive blood culture and had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis, while 91 dogs showed at least one clinical manifestation suggestive of brucellosis although blood culture was negative. of the 38 kennels, 16 (42.1%) had at least one positive dog. the prevalence of infection in each kennel varied from 3.8% to 62.6%. abortion/stillbirth, failure to conceive and enlargement of lymph nodes were significantly associated with brucellosis in female. no association of clinical signs and positive results in blood culture was observed in males. none of the kennels has been carrying out programmes to control brucellosis, and the sale of infected dogs was considered a common practice yielding risks to the public health, in view of the zoonotic potential of the infection.
human_metabolism	this paper presents an analysis of the implications of some recent studies performed to characterize uranium products from modern uranium recovery facilities important for worker protection. assumptions about the solubility (related to the molecular species being produced) of these materials in humans are critical to properly assess radiation dose from intakes, understand chemotoxic implications, and establish protective exposure standards (airborne concentrations, limits on intake, etc.). recent studies, as well as information in the historical professional literature, were reviewed that address the issue of solubility and related characteristics. these data are important for the design of programs for assessment of both chemical and radiological aspects of worker exposure to the products of modern uranium recovery plants (conventional uranium mills and in situ recovery plants; i.e., isrs). the data suggest strongly that the oxide form produced by these facilities (and therefore, product solubility) is related to precipitation chemistry and thermal exposure (dryer temperature). given the peroxide precipitation and low temperature drying methods being used at many modern uranium recovery facilities in the u. s. today, very soluble products are being produced. the dosimetric impacts of these products to the pulmonary system (except perhaps in case of an extreme acute insult) would be small, and any residual pulmonary retention beyond a month or two would most likely be too small to measure by traditional urinalysis sampling or the current state-of-the-art of natural uranium in vivo lung counting techniques. uranium recovery plants should revisit the adequacy of current bioassay programs in the context of their process and product specifics. workers potentially exposed to these very soluble yellowcake concentrates should have urine specimens submitted for uranium analysis on an approximately weekly basis, including analysis for the biomarkers associated with potential renal injury [e.g., glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and protein albumen]. additionally, implications for compliance with current u. s. nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) regulations (e.g., 10 cfr20) are discussed. nrc, the applicable agreement state agencies, and licensees need to recognize the importance of the uranium chemotoxicity versus dose relationship in the interest of worker protection.
genetics	we have analyzed 24 loci including autosomal and y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (strs), y-indel, and sex-determining marker in a sample of 267 unrelated individuals from the mongolian population using the globalfiler (tm) pcr amplification kit to provide an expanded and more reliable forensic database. khalkh among 15 mongolian minor-groups accounts for about 80% of the entire mongolian population. a total of 267 different dna profiles were found in this work. the highest gene diversity was observed in the se33 (0.9376) locus, and the lowest value was found in the tpox (0.6142) locus. although individual power of discrimination estimates varied at the studied loci, combined probability of match from the 21 str loci was estimated to be 1.139 x 10(-24), which is highly informative. based on the results of pair-wise f-st genetic distances and multi-dimensional scaling plot showed that mongolians were clustered into europeans and asians, although mongolia is geographically located in northeastern asia. thus, the present survey of the mongolian population may help establish a comprehensive reference database for forensic and population genetic analyses.
computer-aided_design	background and objective: antibacterial peptides (abps) are essential components of host defense against microbial infections present in all domains of life. the amps incorporating unnatural amino acids (uabps) exhibit several advantages over naturally occurring amps based on factors such as bioavailability, metabolic stability and overall toxicity. methods: computer-aided modeling and in vitro susceptibility test were combined to rationally design short uabps with potent antimicrobial activity. in the procedure, peptide characterization and machine learning modeling were used to develop statistical regression predictors, which were then employed to guide the molecular design and structural optimization of uabps, to which a number of commercially available unnatural amino acids were introduced. results: an improved uabp population was obtained, from which several promising candidates were successfully prepared and their antibacterial potencies against three bacterial strains staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli were measured using broth microdilution assay. consequently, four uabps with hybrid structure property were determined to have high potency against the tested strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of <50 mu g/ml. conclusions: molecular dynamics (md) simulations revealed that the designed uabps are amphipathic helix in solution but they would largely unfold when spontaneously embedding into an artificial lipid bilayer that mimics microbial membrane.

enzymology	introduction: the role of drug transporters as one of the determinants of cellular drug permeability has become increasingly evident. despite the lipophilicity of a drug molecule as rate-limiting factor for passive diffusion across biological membranes, carrier-mediated and active transport have gained attention over the years. a better understanding of the effects and roles of these influx transporters towards transmembrane permeability of a drug molecule need to be delineated for drug development and delivery. areas covered: this review focuses on findings relative to role of transporters in drug absorption and bioavailability. particularly the areas demanding further research have been emphasized. this review will also highlight various transporters expressed on vital organs and their effects on drug pharmacokinetics. expert opinion: significant efforts have been devoted to understand the role of transporters, their iterative interplay with metabolizing enzymes through molecular enzymology, binding and structure-activity relationship studies. a few assays such as parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (pampa) have been developed to analyze drug transport across phospholipid membranes. although large web-accessible databases on tissue selective expression profiles at transcriptomic as well as proteomic are available, there is a need to collocate the scattered literature on the role of transporters in drug development and delivery.
machine_design	an open-source musculoskeletal model for predictions of lumbar muscle forces is presented in this paper. the model is based on a previously published anatomically detailed lumbar spine model, with upper extremity, lower extremity and head-neck models incorporated. it is implemented in opensim, an open-source musculoskeletal modeling platform. the features of this model include the ability to predict joint reactions, lumbar muscle forces and lumbar muscle activation patterns. to validate the ability of the model to predict lumbar loading, the loads acting on the vertebral bodies under several conditions were determined and compared with loads measured in vivo using instrumented vertebral body replacements and pressure transducers in the intervertebral discs. model-predicted loads were strongly correlated with measured loads (r = 0.934); thus, the model successfully predicts variations in loading between different conditions. the model introduced here should ultimately aid in the ergonomics of machine design, since current machines are still mainly designed without knowing reasonable lumbar loads.
strength_of_materials	in the most recent years, structural applications of bonded joints have increased remarkably owing to their several advantages relative to other joining methods. as a consequence, the development of improved models to provide design efficiency and, at the same time, increase the confidence of designers acquires special relevancy. recent developments considering cohesive and continuum mixed-mode damage models have demonstrated that these methods are able to deal with several details inherent to mechanical behaviour of bonded joints. both methods allow simulation of damage initiation and propagation by combining classical strength of materials approaches with fracture mechanics concepts. in this work, several different mixed-mode cohesive laws adapted to different types of adhesives mechanical behaviour are presented and discussed. effectively, while mechanical behaviour of brittle or moderately ductile adhesives is well simulated by means of the simple bilinear cohesive law, adhesives with pronounced ductile behaviour require more sophisticated cohesive laws. the aspects regarding determination of some cohesive parameters are also given special attention in the present paper. a continuum mixed-mode damage model is also presented using the bilinear softening cohesive law. this model is advantageous since properties degradation takes place inside solid elements used to simulate the adhesive, which allows the evaluation of specific issues like the influence of asymmetric propagation on joint mechanical behaviour in a more realistic manner. important conclusions about advantages and drawbacks of both methodologies are drawn.
enzymology	phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pcya) catalyzes the proton-coupled four-electron reduction of biliverdin ix alpha 's two vinyl groups to produce phycocyanobilin, an essential chromophore for phytochromes, cyanobacteriochromes and phycobiliproteins. previous site directed mutagenesis studies indicated that the fully conserved residue his74 plays a critical role in the h-bonding network that permits proton transfer. here, we exploit x-ray crystallography, enzymology and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the functional role of this invariant histidine. the structures of the h74a, h74e and h74q variants of pcya reveal that a ""conserved"" buried water molecule that bridges his74 and catalytically essential his88 is not required for activity. despite distinct conformations of glu74 and gln74 in the h74e and h74q variants, both retain reasonable activity while the h74a variant is inactive, suggesting smaller residues may generate cavities that increase flexibility, thereby reducing enzymatic activity. molecular dynamic simulations further reveal that the crucial active site residue asp105 is more dynamic in h74a compared to wild-type pcya and the two other his74 variants, supporting the conclusion that the ala74 mutation has increased the flexibility of the active site.

manufacturing_engineering	evolution of manufacturing technology has been a definitive indicator of human society 's development. from the wheels that started the spree to the world of machines that have revolutionized the manufacturing processes, manufacturing tools have been indicative of eras of development. in this paper, we have focused on the branch of engineering that deals with manufacturing - specifically its structure in india. in this study we investigate some premier government institutes with respect to manufacturing engineering education. we have also included the technical education model at different education level.
polymerase_chain_reaction	fusarium head blight is a major disease of wheat and an important contributor to the reduced cultivation of wheat in south africa, where the crop often is grown under irrigation. we collected fusarium isolates from 860 fusarium head blight-infected wheat heads in seven irrigated wheat-growing areas of south africa. six fusarium species, i.e., f. chlamydosporum, f. crookwellense, f. culmorum, f. equiseti, f. graminearum and f. semitectum were recovered, three of which, i.e., f. chlamydosporum, f. equiseti and f. semitectum, were not previously associated with fusarium head blight in south africa. fusarium graminearum occurred at high frequencies at all seven locations. based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays of diagnostic sequences, more isolates were predicted to produce deoxynivalenol than nivalenol. fusarium graminearum (sensu lato) appears to be the primary causal agent of fusarium head blight in irrigated wheat in south africa, which may not be the case for wheat cultivated under rain-fed conditions. rotations of irrigated wheat with other graminaceous crops and maize could increase fungal inoculum and disease pressure. the establishment of fusarium head blight in the irrigated wheat region of the country means that resistant lines and alternative agronomic practices are needed to limit disease severity, yield losses and mycotoxin contamination.
molecular_biology	the dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddntps) terminate the bio-polymerization of dna and become essential chemical component of dna sequencing technology which is now basic tool for molecular biology research. in this method the radiolabeled or fluorescent dye labeled ddntp analogues are being used for dna sequencing by detection of the terminated dna fragment after single labeled ddntp incorporation into dna under pcr conditions. this report describes the syntheses of rationally designed novel amino-functionalized ddntp analogue such as pyrrolidine nucleoside triphosphates (prntps), and their polymerase activities with dna polymerase by lc-ms and gel-electrophoretic techniques. the mass and page analyses strongly support the incorporation of prntps into dna oligonucleotide with therminator dna polymerase as like control substrate ddntp. as resultant the dna oligonucleotide are functionalized as amine group by prntp incorporation with polymerase. hence prntps provide opportunities to prepare demandable conjugated dna with other biomolecules/dyes/fluorescence molecule without modifying nucleobase structure.

human_metabolism	this text proposes that time is essentially related to one 's visual metabolic rate. metabolic rate is regulated by the speed of the intake of energy, the rate of the production of adenosine triphosphate (atp) to the visual areas. the author 's working hypothesis is that the visual area of the brain known as human v5, the region involved in motion detection, may be the region most responsible for time perception. our time sense from all the senses is, thus, compiled in the visual region, the speed of the human perception of reality. time is the relationship of the human perception of reality and the rate that the reality itself is taking place (given by light waves in the environment). hence, vision (and the visual cortex area v5) may be the vitally important aspects in answering the question: what is time? when we are not looking at a clock, time may be governed by our rate of metabolism; rate of the production of atp by the mitochondria in v5. for example, when general human metabolism (and v5) is fast, time runs slow. when metabolic rate is relatively slow, time runs relatively faster. many factors enter into the speed of metabolism such as age, sex, drug effects, velocity compared to speed c, states of boredom or excitement, darkness or light and mental states such as sleep. the relationship between time and space is discussed with the metabolic rate of v5 in mind. because the uncertainty principle and the quantum picture of reality are adopted, this model qualitatively quantizes space and time, showing why they must forever be connected i.e. space-time. this idea is discussed in relation to zeno 's paradox, which suggests that space and time are indeed quantized events, instants and entropy are defined reality can be understood in terms of the speed of the processing of instants. the arrow of time is pictured as caused by long-term potentiation of synaptic neurons within the brain. minkowski-einstein space-time is analyzed and compared with the visual metabolic rate. the probable consequences of this model are proposed.
computer-aided_design	laser sintered technology has been introduced for clinical use and can be utilized more widely, accompanied by the digitalization of dentistry and the development of direct oral scanning devices. this study was performed with the aim of comparing the marginal accuracy and internal fit of co-cr alloy copings fabricated by casting, cad/cam (computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture) milled, and 3-d laser sintered techniques. a total of 36 co-cr alloy crown-copings were fabricated from an implant abutment. the marginal and internal fit were evaluated by measuring the weight of the silicone material, the vertical marginal discrepancy using a microscope, and the internal gap in the sectioned specimens. the data were statistically analyzed by one-way anova (analysis of variance), a scheffe 's test, and pearson 's correlation at the significance level of p = 0.05, using statistics software. the silicone weight was significantly low in the casting group. the 3-d laser sintered group showed the highest vertical discrepancy, and marginal-, occlusal-, and average-internal gaps (p < 0.05). the cad/cam milled group revealed a significantly high axial internal gap. there are moderate correlations between the vertical marginal discrepancy and the internal gap variables (r = 0.654), except for the silicone weight. in this study, the 3-d laser sintered group achieved clinically acceptable marginal accuracy and internal fit.
molecular_biology	introduction: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (pdac) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. recently, two chemotherapy regimens have proven to improve median overall survival in comparison with gemcitabine. based on better understanding of tumor molecular biology and of the role of tumor microenvironment, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) could be an interesting and new type of targeted treatment of pdac. areas covered: preclinical and clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of several mabs in pancreatic cancer treatment. this review will underline the most important targeted pathways by mabs involved in this disease, including egfr, her-2, igf-1 r, vegf/vegfr, notch, wnt and immune checkpoints. expert opinion: despite the promising results of preclinical and phase i trials, the addition of mabs to standard chemotherapy or in association with other target agents seems not to confirm these results in the following phase ii and iii trials in pancreatic cancer patients. however, an improved patient selection before treatment based on molecular characteristics in association with reliable predictive biomarkers can identified more efficacious treatment approaches, minimizing toxicity profile of these drugs.
southern_blotting	while epstein barr virus (ebv) is associated with about 10% of gastric carcinomas worldwide, the role of the virus in the tumorigenesis of ebv-associated gastric carcinoma (ebvagc) is unclear. previously, we reported that a gastric cancer cell line, snu-719, that is naturally infected with ebv closely resembles ebvagc. here, we attempted to eliminate the ebv genome from snu-719 cells to ascertain the influence of ebv in ebvagc. southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) showed that ebv genomes were maintained as episomes in snu-719 cells. to remove ebv episomes, snu-719 cells were first cultured in a hydroxyurea (hu)-containing medium for up to 6 months. real-time polymerase chain reaction and fish results revealed no evidence of hu-mediated ebv genome reduction, although cell growth was reduced by acute hu treatment in dose- and time-dependent manners. two small interfering rnas against epstein barr nuclear antigen 1 (ebna1) abrogated over 90% of the ectopic ebna1 expression in hela cells, but only 40% of endogenous ebna1 expression in snu-719 cells. together, our data suggest that maintenance of latent ebv infection is essential for the viability of ebvagc cells, avoiding elimination of ebv episomes from the cells.
enzymology	although there is much knowledge of the enzymology (and genes coding the proteins) of lipid biosynthesis in higher plants, relatively little attention has been paid to regulation. we have demonstrated the important role for cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase in the biosynthesis of the major extra-plastidic membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine. we followed this work by applying control analysis to light-induced fatty acid synthesis. this was the first such application to lipid synthesis in any organism. the data showed that acetyl-coa carboxylase was very important, exerting about half of the total control. we then applied metabolic control analysis to lipid accumulation in important oil crops - oilpalm, olive, and rapeseed. recent data with soybean show that the block of fatty acid biosynthesis reactions exerts somewhat more control (63%) than lipid assembly although both are clearly very important. these results suggest that gene stacks, targeting both parts of the overall lipid synthesis pathway will be needed to increase significantly oil yields in soybean. this article is part of a special issue entitled: membrane structure and function: relevance in the cell 's physiology, pathology and therapy.

hydraulics	hydraulic jump is a phenomenon which usually occurs in rivers and in correspondence with hydraulic structures. it is characterized by a rapid transition from a super- to sub-critical flow conditions, involving a huge energy dissipation. for its characteristics and its relevance in hydraulics, it has been studied since the early years of the last century. nevertheless, many features still require a further investigation, e.g., scale effects, air entrainment process, effect of bed ""roughness on conjugate depths, etc. in particular, in the last few decades, the analysis of the main geometric parameters has been further developed. nevertheless, no studies dealing with d-jump occurring on a rough sloping channel are present in literature. therefore, the present paper reports the results of experimental investigations, which allowed to develop a semi-theoretical approach in order to evaluate the d-jump conjugate depth in a wide range of channel bed geometric and boundary configurations.

molecular_biology	bioinformatics field has now solidly settled itself as a control in molecular biology and incorporates an extensive variety of branches of knowledge from structural biology, genomics to gene expression studies. bioinformatics is the application of computer technology to the management of biological information. genomic signal processing (gsp) techniques have been connected most all around in bioinformatics and will keep on assuming an essential part in the investigation of biomedical issues. gsp refers to using the digital signal processing (dsp) methods for genomic data (e.g. dna sequences) analysis. recently, applications of gsp in bioinformatics have obtained great consideration such as identification of dna protein coding regions, identification of reading frames, cancer detection and others. cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases that the world faces and has raised the death rate in recent years, it is known medically as malignant neoplasm, so detection of it at the early stage can yield a promising approach to determine and take actions to treat with this risk. gsp is a method which can be used to detect the cancerous cells that are often caused due to genetic abnormality. this systematic review discusses some of the gsp applications in bioinformatics generally. the gsp techniques, used for cancer detection especially, are presented to collect the recent results and what has been reached at this point to be a new subject of research.
human_metabolism	creatine (cr) is recommended as a dietary supplement especially for athletes but its therapeutic potential is also discussed. it is assumed that human body uses cr for the formation of phosphocreatine, which is necessary for muscular work as a source of energy. production of cr in a body is closely connected to methionine cycle where guanidinoacetate (gaa) is in a final step methylated from s-adenosylmethionine (sam). increased availability of sam for phosphatidylcholine (pc) and sarcosine synthesis can potentially stimulate endogenous production of betaine a thus methylation of homocysteine (hcy) to form methionine. our subject who was methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) 677tt homozygote lowered plasma hcy from 33.3 mu mol/l to 17.1 mu mol/l following one-month cr supplementation (5 g/day) opposite to 677cc and ct genotypes whose hcy levels tended to increase (but still in normal ranges). we suppose that cr supplementation stimulates pathways leading to production of sarcosine which can serve to regenerate tetrahydrofolate (thf) to form 5,10-methylene-thf. this could potentially increase mthfr enzyme activity which may later result in increased hcy methylation. cr supplementation significantly effects metabolism of one carbon unit and potentially lower body 's demands for methyl groups. this could be beneficial as in the case of reduced enzyme activity such as mthfr 677c/t polymorphism.
strength_of_materials	the performance of industrial waste incineration bottom ash in controlled low-strength material (clsm) was investigated in this paper, as the quarry dust was added. clsm mixtures were made from the industrial waste incineration bottom ash, quarry dust, and cement. tests for fresh density, bleeding, compressive strength, shear strength, hydraulic conductivity, and excavatability were carried out. the compressive strength ranges from 60 kpa to 6790 kpa, the friction angle varies from 5a degrees to 19a degrees, and the cohesion is from 4 to 604 kpa. most of the mixtures are found to be non-excavatable. it is indicated that the quarry dust addition increases the compressive strength and shear parameters, decreases bleeding, and increases the removability modulus.
genetics	species of the drosophila melanogaster species subgroup, including the species d. simulans, d. mauritiana, d. yakuba, and d. santomea, have long served as model systems for studying evolution. however, studies in these species have been limited by a paucity of genetic and transgenic reagents. here, we describe a collection of transgenic and genetic strains generated to facilitate genetic studies within and between these species. we have generated many strains of each species containing mapped piggybac transposons including an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eyfp) gene expressed in the eyes and a phi c31 attp site-specific integration site. we have tested a subset of these lines for integration efficiency and reporter gene expression levels. we have also generated a smaller collection of other lines expressing other genetically encoded fluorescent molecules in the eyes and a number of other transgenic reagents that will be useful for functional studies in these species. in addition, we have mapped the insertion locations of 58 transposable elements in d. virilis that will be useful for genetic mapping studies.
cell_biology	studies on the caenorhabditis elegans nucleus have provided fascinating insight to the organization and activities of eukaryotic cells. being the organelle that holds the genetic blueprint of the cell, the nucleus is critical for basically every aspect of cell biology. the stereotypical development of c. elegans from a one cell-stage embryo to a fertile hermaphrodite with 959 somatic nuclei has allowed the identification of mutants with specific alterations in gene expression programs, nuclear morphology, or nuclear positioning. moreover, the early c. elegans embryo is an excellent model to dissect the mitotic processes of nuclear disassembly and reformation with high spatiotemporal resolution. we review here several features of the c. elegans nucleus, including its composition, structure, and dynamics. we also discuss the spatial organization of chromatin and regulation of gene expression and how this depends on tight control of nucleocytoplasmic transport. finally, the extensive connections of the nucleus with the cytoskeleton and their implications during development are described. most processes of the c. elegans nucleus are evolutionarily conserved, highlighting the relevance of this powerful and versatile model organism to human biology.
genetics	real-time imaging of regulated exocytosis in secreting organs can provide unprecedented temporal and spatial detail. here, we highlight recent advances in 3d time-lapse imaging in drosophila salivary glands at single-granule resolution. using fluorescently labeled proteins expressed in the fly, it is now possible to image the dynamics of vesicle biogenesis and the cytoskeletal factors involved in secretion. 3d imaging over time allows one to visualize and define the temporal sequence of events, including clearance of cortical actin, fusion pore formation, mixing of the vesicular and plasma membranes and recruitment of components of the cytoskeleton. we will also discuss the genetic tools available in the fly that allow one to interrogate the essential factors involved in secretory vesicle formation, cargo secretion and the ultimate integration of the vesicular and plasma membranes. we argue that the combination of high-resolution real-time imaging and powerful genetics provides a platform to investigate the role of any factor in regulated secretion.
hydraulics	an overview is given on the work of the laboratory of nuclear energy systems at eth, zurich (ethz) and of the laboratory of thermal hydraulics at paul scherrer institute (psi), switzerland on tight-lattice bundles. two-phase flow in subchannels of a tight triangular lattice was studied experimentally and by computational fluid dynamics simulations. two adiabatic facilities were used: (1) a vertical channel modeling a pair of neighboring sub channels; and (2) an arrangement of four subchannels with one subchannel in the center. the first geometry was equipped with two electrical film sensors placed on opposing rod surfaces forming the subchannel gap. they recorded 2d liquid film thickness distributions on a domain of 16 x 64 measuring points each, with a time resolution of 10 khz. in the bubbly and slug flow regime, information on the bubble size, shape, and velocity and the residual liquid film thickness underneath the bubbles were obtained. the second channel was investigated using cold neutron tomography, which allowed the measurement of average liquid film profiles showing the effect of spacer grids with vanes. the results were reproduced by large eddy simulation + volume of fluid. in the outlook, a novel nonadiabatic subchannel experiment is introduced that can be driven to steady-state dryout. a refrigerant is heated by a heavy water circuit, which allows the application of cold neutron tomography. copyright (c) 2016, published by elsevier korea llc on behalf of korean nuclear society.
immunology	the large majority of classified primary immune deficiency (pid) diseases present in childhood. yet, most patients with pid are adults, with a large proportion experiencing onset of symptoms beyond their childhood years. most of these are diagnosed predominantly with antibody defects, but cellular and other disorders are increasingly being identified in older patients as well. moreover, advances in clinical immunology are allowing pediatric patients, even those with severe disease, to reach adulthood. because of differences in the physiology and pathophysiology of children and adults, the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a complex chronic disease could differ significantly between these patient populations and therefore require modifications in approach.

manufacturing_engineering	investigation on surface roughness of thin films is an important issue in manufacturing engineering because the performance of a coated film is significantly affected by the surface roughness of thin films. a fast and flexible optical measurement system to measure surface roughness of hard coatings deposited by cathodic arc evaporation is developed in this work. the objective of this work is to examine the repeatability and reproducibility (r&r) of an optical measurement system. percentage of equipment variation, appraiser variation and r&r is 7.25%, 1.42% and 7.39%. thin film optical measurement system developed is acceptable according to the measurement systems analysis and the r&r technique.

hydraulics	this study numerically investigated the laminar mixed-convection heat transfer of different water copper nanofluids inside a microtube with curvature angle of 90 degrees using a finite volume method. the reynolds number of modeling was 10, nanoparticles volume fractions were chosen from 0.0% to 6.0% and richardson numbers varied from 0.1 to 10. the findings were depicted for dimensionless axial velocity, coefficient of friction and nusselt number profiles as well as dimensionless temperature contours. the validity of model was excellent compared to former numerical and experimental studies. the results showed that the heat transfer and hydraulics behavior of nanofluids in curved geometries is to some extent different with other geometries and flat surfaces due to presence of buoyancy and centrifugal forces at the same time. especially, in the regions near and after 45 degrees curvature angle, the behavior of heat transfer and nanofluid flow is unpredictable. in this region, increasing the nanoparticles volume concentration or transition from forced convection regime to free convection state, cause a decrease in nusselt number and friction factor. that 's while for the entrance region of microtube, the results are completely opposite; increasing the richardson number or nanoparticle concentration enhances the heat transfer as well as friction factor. also, the velocity profile variations in the vertical and horizontal diameter of microtube is significant in areas of 60 degrees (pi/3) and the heterogeneity of this profile increases by rising rayleigh number and volume fraction of solid particles.

polymerase_chain_reaction	kin17 dna and rna binding protein (kin17) is a highly conserved protein that participates in dna replication, dna repair and cell cycle progression. recently, the tumor-promoting function of kin17 has been demonstrated and increasingly studied. in the present study, the role of kin17 in the invasion and metastasis of non-small cells lung cancer (nsclc) was investigated. elevated kin17 mrna and protein expression was identified in a total of 97 nsclc and benign lung lesion tissue specimens. kin17 overexpression was significantly correlated with high tumor grade and lymph node metastasis, indicating poor patient prognosis. scratch and transwell assays demonstrated that the knockdown of kin17 inhibited the ability of nsclc cells to migrate and invade. furthermore, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses confirmed that knockdown of kin17 decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7, epidermal growth factor receptor and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog. the results of the present study indicate that kin17 is markedly overexpressed in nsclc tissues compared with benign lung lesion and peritumoral tissue. the upregulation of kin17 may serve an important role in the metastasis of nsclc cells. these results indicate that kin17 is a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of nsclc, in addition to being a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with nsclc.
manufacturing_engineering	the paper analyzes the difference between useful signal and noise signal in dissemination characteristic inside wavelet space in manufacturing engineering, and then puts forward a search algorithm based on wavelet decorrelation white noise testing and involved with the parameters in a parametric equation. the algorithm can select wavelet transform to realize the best noise reduction effect in a self-adaptive way according to the characteristic of signal containing noise and signal to noise ratio. at last, simulation experiment and engineering application are made, and their results are compared with the decomposition result of daubechies wavelet. it 's concluded that self-adaptive wavelet basis can more adequately separate useful information from signal.
manufacturing_engineering	earlier association rule data mining was mainly used for analysis of market basket data but now the scope has widened. it is experimented in various areas where extraction of interesting correlations can help like healthcare, education systems, manufacturing engineering, network management, intelligence etc. as android is a new technology which came into use from 2008 only, very few researchers have touched the area of applying association rule mining on android applications. here an implementation of association rule fp-growth algorithm on similar android applications (clones) is done, which is a novel area itself. paper describes a framework which mines association rules from android application clones. the analysis of the rules and dependencies proved fruitful and gave useful results. interesting relations are extracted between codes, which can help the developers in performing future operations like modification of the code easily.
human_metabolism	alpha-linolenic acid (alpha lna; 18 : 3n-3) is essential in the human diet, probably because it is the substrate for the synthesis of longer-chain, more unsaturated n-3 fatty acids, principally epa (20 : 5n-3) and dha (22 : 6n-3), which confer important biophysical properties on cell membranes and so are required for tissue function. the extent to which this molecular transformation occurs in man is controversial. the present paper reviews the recent literature on the metabolism of alpha lna in man, including the use of dietary alpha lna in beta-oxidation, recycling of carbon by fatty acid synthesis de novo and conversion to longer-chain pufa. sex differences in alpha lna metabolism and the possible biological consequences are discussed. increased consumption of epa and dha in fish oil has a number of well-characterised beneficial effects on health. the present paper also reviews the efficacy of increased alpha lna consumption in increasing the concentrations of epa and dha in blood and cell lipid pools, and the extent to which such dietary interventions might be protective against cvd and inflammation. although the effects on cvd risk factors and inflammatory markers are variable, where beneficial effects have been reported these are weaker than have been achieved from increasing consumption of epa+dha or linoleic acid. overall, the limited capacity for conversion to longer-chain n-3 fatty acids, and the lack of efficacy in ameliorating cvd risk factors and inflammatory markers in man suggests that increased consumption of alpha lna may be of little benefit in altering epa+dha status or in improving health outcomes compared with other dietary interventions.
enzymology	ten years after the initial identification of human renalase the first genuinely catalytic substrates have been identified. throughout the prior decade a consensus belief that renalase is produced predominantly by the kidney and catalytically oxidizes catecholamines in order to lower blood pressure and slow the heart has prevailed. this belief was, however, based on fundamentally flawed scientific observations that did not include control reactions to account for the well-known autoxidation of catecholamines in oxygenated solutions. nonetheless, the initial claims have served as the kernel for a rapidly expanding body of research largely predicated on the belief that catecholamines are substrates for this enzyme. the proliferation of scientific studies pertaining to renalase as a hormone has proceeded unabated despite well-reasoned expressions of dissent that have indicated the deficiencies of the initial observations and other inconsistencies. our group has very recently identified isomeric forms of beta-nad(p)h as substrates for renalase. these substrates arise from non-specific reduction of beta-nad(p)(+) that forms beta-4-dihydronad(p) (beta-nad(p)h), beta-2-dihydronad(p) and beta-6-dihydronad(p); the latter two being substrates for renalase. renalase oxidizes these substrates with rate constants that are up to 10(4)-fold faster than any claimed for catecholamines. the electrons harvested are delivered to dioxygen via the enzyme 's fad cofactor forming both h2o2 and beta-nad(p)(+) as products. it would appear that the metabolic purpose of this chemistry is to alleviate the inhibitory effect of beta-2-dihydronad(p) and beta-6-dihydronad(p) on primary metabolism dehydrogenase enzymes. the identification of this genuinely catalytic activity for renalase calls for re-evaluation of much of the research of this enzyme, in which definitive links between renalase catecholamine consumption and physiological responses were reported. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

northern_blotting	degradation of rna as an intermediate message between genes and corresponding proteins is important for rapid attenuation of gene expression and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. this process is controlled by ribonucleases that have different target specificities. in the bacterial pathogen helicobacter pylori, an exo- and endoribonuclease rnase j is essential for growth. to explore the role of rnase j in h. pylori, we identified its putative targets at a global scale using next generation rna sequencing. we found that strong depletion for rnase j led to a massive increase in the steady-state levels of non-rrnas. mrnas and rnas antisense to open reading frames were most affected with over 80% increased more than 2-fold. non-coding rnas expressed in the intergenic regions were much less affected by rnase j depletion. northern blotting of selected messenger and non-coding rnas validated these results. globally, our data suggest that rnase j of h. pylori is a major rnase involved in degradation of most cellular rnas.
materials_engineering	creating an environment to enable the seamless integration of experiment, computation, and data within a laboratory environment is essential to enabling the practice of integrated computational materials engineering. such an environment depends on the connection of experimental equipment and high performance computing resources to a collaborative software environment that supports research teams through simulation tool sharing and archival data management in a secure manner. key functions of such a system include project management, workflow management, tool staging, data provenance tracking, and user authentication. an overview will be provided on efforts to establish such an integrated collaborative environment in a research laboratory involved in material and process discovery and development in both structural and functional materials.
machine_design	this paper deals with rare-earth-free permanent magnet traction machine design for c-segment electric vehicle (ev). four different ferrite permanent magnet synchronous machine topologies having different magnets arrangement and pole-pair number, selected for their high potential, are presented and compared thanks to a computationally efficient finite-element based analysis tool that was developed purposely. it was found that flux focusing machine having 12 poles and 72 slots outperforms in terms of torque-speed requirement fulfillment, efficiency and power to weight ratio. influence of the magnet grade on the resilience against demagnetization under symmetrical short-circuit condition of the selected machine was then investigated. it is shown that the machine is subject to complete demagnetization if low grade hard ferrite (ceramic 8) is adopted, thereby fostering research of new and abundantly available magnet grades is key for penetration of new and cost effective electrical machines into ev powertrain market.
thermodynamics	we prepared srcuo2 thin film by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering on glass substrate and have investigated its post-annealing effects on structure and thermal conductivity. the as-sputtered film belongs to two-dimensional spin system srcuo2, namely, layer-type srcuo2, which has a possibility of exhibiting high, anisotropic thermal conductivity by magnetic excitation of the spins. it was found that the as-sputtered film has (001)-orientation in which the spin layers are parallel to the surface of substrate and that post-annealing results in enhancement of crystallinity of the film such as disappearance of grain boundaries, which can cause an increase in thermal conductivity.

polymerase_chain_reaction	maturation of cumulus-oocyte complexes (cocs) is crucial for further successful monospermic fertilization, embryo growth, and implantation. all these events are accompanied by proliferation and differentiation of cumulus cells. the migration of cocs to the oviduct after ovulation and the interaction between female gametes and/or embryos with maternal tissues are still poorly recognized on the molecular level. this study was aimed to first demonstrate themrnaexpression profile of cell migration markers during different stages of porcine oocytes maturation and developmental capability in vitro. the cocs were collected from a total of 45 pubertal crossbred landrace gilts, brilliant cresyl blue (bcb) stained, and analyzed before (n = 150) or after (n = 150) in vitro maturation (ivm). using the affymetrix((r)) porcine gene 1.1 st array, the expression profile of 12,258 porcine transcripts was examined. we found nine genes involved in cell migration mechanisms, that is, pld1, kit, lama2, map3k1, vegfa, tgfbr3, insr, tpm1, and rtn4. these genes were upregulated in porcine oocytes before ivm as compared with post-ivm expression analysis. moreover, important mechanisms of biological interaction between vegfa-kit and vegfa-insr were also observed. the upregulation and/or downregulation of selected mrnas expression after microarray assays was checked and approved by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we suggest that several genes, including lama2 or tpm1, encode proteins participating in the formation of the oocyte 's protein architecture such as microtubules and kinetochore reorganization. as the expression of all `` migration regulatory genes'' investigated in this study was significantly upregulated in oocytes before ivm, we conclude that they may contribute to the maturational capability of porcine oocytes. however, migration potency of cocs is not accompanied by achievement of the mii stage by porcine oocytes in vitro. the investigated genes such as pld1, kit, lama2, map3k1, vegfa, tgfbr3, insr, tpm1, and rtn4 may be recognized as a new marker of porcine oocytes maturational competence during in vitro culture.
internal_combustion_engine	homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) engines are a promising alternative to traditional spark-and compression-ignition engines, due to their potential to achieve a high thermal efficiency and near-zero emissions of nox and soot. in this work, the heat transfer from the bulk gas to the cylinder wall is measured during motored and hcci operation in a single cylinder (cfr) engine fueled with n-heptane. heat flux measurements in the cylinder wall and head show small spatial variation of the heat flux in the combustion chamber. design of experiments methods are applied to study the effect of the engine settings on the heat transfer. it is found that the inlet air temperature does not affect the heat flux under motored operation. under fired operation, all engine settings affect the heat transfer, but none of their interactions are significant. the compression ratio and inlet air temperature have a quadratic effect on the peak heat flux and peak convection coefficient, whereas the mass fuel rate has a linear effect. for the total heat released, the compression ratio and inlet air temperature have a linear effect and the mass fuel rate has a quadratic effect on it. all engine settings affect the instantaneous heat flux.

strength_of_materials	strength of materials or the mechanics of deformable bodies is the part of mechanics which deals with the study of and the relationship between internal forces and deformations arising in real bodies and their changes in shape and size in relation to loads acting on them, their linkages and the physical properties of the material they are made of. in general, resistance of materials engineering provides the foundation that will allow us to, together with the conditions of stability and balance, calculate and project work or elements of machines, determining their size or verifying that they are well designed and are suitable for their proposed objectives. this is why we can distinguish two perspectives in the scope of this subject; firstly the problem of sizing and secondly, checking. the study of scientific-technological areas must have the characteristic of providing practical results, so it gives students the opportunity to test the usefulness of the course in solving everyday problems in the practice of engineering. it is important that the teacher uses this to obtain maximum attention and interest of students [2]. the study of the strength of materials can not be done in isolation, but must rely on knowledge of mechanics and be related to the study of elasticity. the difference between the theory of elasticity and strength of materials is primarily focusing on the problem, as the theory of elasticity is based on more accurate approaches which means we can dispense with some simplified assumptions adopted by strength of materials. the subject of elasticity and strength of materials (erm) is usually given during the middle years of the degree. it is a compulsory subject in most engineering degrees, as well as in architecture, agronomy, etc. the vastness of the subject, the assumptions that simplify every problem and sometimes the lack of practical experiments that support the accuracy of the theoretical analysis, provoke insecurity, lack of student motivation and lack of critical thinking, which are essential for an engineer [4]. to remedy this lack of motivation, insecurity and critical spirit, we propose the creation of a working group. the work is to analyze the stress state of a real piece comparing the results of three methods of analysis. the first method would be theoretical analysis, the second and third experimental analysis and numerical analysis. the variation in results obtained by each method will promote discussion and analysis of the reasons for these results. the choice of the piece is important because a very complex piece would be beyond the bounds of the subject, and a very simple piece would not produce a significant variation in results. the teaching experiment was performed with the participation of four teams or groups of student volunteers [8]. to test whether the introduction of this work in the subject generates a positive educational outcome, we have conducted a student survey, focusing on three aspects: the acquisition of knowledge, increased motivation and the importance of the course for a future engineer. this survey provided very different results between students who have participated in the project and those who have not. the students who took part in the 3-part analysis felt able to discuss any real part of the subject and the others have much less understanding of the subject. students in the surveys on the teaching of the real life problems give the impression that they have not achieved the main objectives.
enzymology	as described in enzymology, ""induced fit"" and ""lock and key"" models are used to explain the enzymic specificity of substrate. previously, authors have studied the substrate specificity of eisenia fetida protease i (ffp-i), showing that the interaction between this protease and its substrates underwent an ""induced fit"" followed by ""lock and key"" model. it needs further investigating whether this model is suitable for other enzymes. here, the reactions of substrate-induced eisenia fetida protease ii (efp-ii), subtilisin (sub) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) with their substrates were shown. efp-ii and sub could not recognize chromozym u (cu) (p < 0.05) after incubated with chromozym th (cth) although the two proteases are natively able to react with both cth and cu. the reaction followed an ""induced fit-lock and key"" pattern. in contrast, the two proteases were still able to react with cth even though they have been incubated with cu. but neither earthworm protease nor subtilisin could recognize cu after cu and cth treatment in turn, still suggesting that the reactions followed an ""induced fit and then lock and key"" procedure. furthermore, the activity of ldh with lactate significantly decreased (p<0.05) after the enzyme had been incubated with pyruvate. the activity on the conversion of pyruvate into lactate was not significantly affected by a prior incubation with lactate. this suggests that the pyruvate-induced complementary conformation of ldh is more stable than lactate-induced conformation.
strength_of_materials	this paper examines the use of a continuum damage model to predict strength and size effects in notched carbon-epoxy laminates. the effects of size and the development of a fracture process zone before final failure are identified in an experimental program. the continuum damage model is described and the resulting predictions of size effects are compared with alternative approaches: the point stress and the inherent flaw models, the linear elastic fracture mechanics approach, and the strength of materials approach. the results indicate that the continuum damage model is the most accurate technique to predict size effects in composites. furthermore, the continuum damage model does not require any calibration and it is applicable to general geometries and boundary conditions.

hydraulics	in high-velocity chute flows, free-surface aeration is often observed. the phenomenon is called self-aeration or white waters. when the turbulent shear stresses next to the free-surface are large enough, air bubbles are entrained throughout the entire airwater column. a rapidly-varied flow region is observed immediately downstream of the inception point of free-surface aeration. an analytical solution of the air diffusion equation is proposed and the results compare well with new experimental data. both experiments and theory indicate that the flow bulking spans over approximately 3-4 step cavities downstream of the inception point of free-surface aeration on a stepped chute. further downstream the void fraction distributions follow closely earlier solutions of the air diffusion equation. the application of the diffusion equation solution to prototype and laboratory data shows air bubble diffusivities typically larger than the momentum transfer coefficient. the result highlights however a marked decrease in the ratio of air bubble diffusivity to eddy viscosity with increasing reynolds number. the finding might indicate some limitation of laboratory investigations of air bubble diffusion process in self-aerated flows and of their extrapolation to full-scale prototype applications.
fluid_mechanics	while onsite measurement of air permeability provides a useful approach to assess the service life of concrete structures, the combined use of onsite and laboratory measurement of air permeability is useful to anticipate whether the target service life is to be achieved. this investigation was developed within the aim of founding the application of an air permeability test (torrent method), based on the experimental observation of specimen geometry and surface influence on air permeability results. an experimental program was developed considering three specimen geometries, two types of surface, and twelve concrete mixes. the results were analysed and no significant influence of the tested specimens geometry and surfaces was detected. therefore, the use of any of the surfaces or specimens geometry in mix approval or in compliance control processes is possible without correction of the results. this work constitutes a contribution to further understanding of the test method in particular and of concrete air permeability assessment in general.
computer-aided_design	a method is presented for modeling the tensile behavior of multifilament twisted yarns. a filament assembly model and a computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering (cad/cae) approach are proposed for the tensile analysis. the geometry of the twisted yarn and the nonlinear filament properties were considered. the finite element method (fem) and large deformation effects were applied for computation of the stress-extension curves. ideal yarn structures of five layers with different twist angles were simulated to predict the tensile behavior of each filament and each layer. the stress acting on the filaments after yarn extension could be directly analyzed by the fem. the stress distribution in the filaments showed that the highest stress regions were located at the filament in the center of the yarn and decreased slightly to the yarn surface. the stress-extensions of the filaments were converted to yarn tensile behavior that is shown in terms of the maximum and average stress-extension curves. the results of this prediction model were compared with the stress-strain curves of high-tenacity rayon yarn and the energy method. the maximum stress-extension curves showed very good agreement with experimental results and are more accurate than those obtained by previous methods.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objectives: to investigate whether lep g2548a and lepr q223r polymorphisms influence serum lipid levels and whether the 2 polymorphisms affect the efficacy of simvastatin treatment in chinese patients with primary hyperlipidemia. methods: we used an extreme sampling approach by selecting 212 individuals from the top and bottom 15% of adjusted lipid-lowering response residuals to simvastatin (n = 106 in each group of good or bad response) from a total of 734 samples with primary hyperlipidemia. they were treated with simvastatin orally 20 mg/d. fasting serum lipids were measured at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. genotyping was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. results: more patients in the good response group (27%) had lepr q223r than in the bad response group (16%, p =.046). secondary stratified analyses showed that patients carrying the rr genotype of the lepr q223r gene had significantly higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than those with the qr genotype at baseline (p = .034) among good responders. after 29 consecutive days of treatment with simvastatin, patients carrying the rr genotype had a significantly larger decrease in triglycerides (change: -0.74 +/- 0.92, p =.036) and total cholesterol levels (change: -1.77 +/- 0.68, p = .023) compared with those carrying qr genotype among bad responders. after bonferroni correction, the results were not statistically significant. conclusion: lepr q223r polymorphism, but not lep g2548a, could modulate the efficacy of simvastatin in chinese patients with primary hyperlipidemia.
enzymology	the currently known methods of enzymatic beta-lactam synthesis, as well as the enzymes and heterogeneous biocatalysts used for this purpose, are presented, and the published reports on advances in the field of enzymatic synthesis of selected antibiotics belonging to the groups of penicillin acids and cephalosporin acids are summarized in the present review. the key conditions and parameters of biocatalytic processes, such as the biocatalyst form, concentration of the precursor compounds, solvent type, ph, temperature, etc. are analyzed and compared, and guidelines for further optimization of beta-lactam synthesis are given. the present review may be of use for a wide range of readers, as well as to enzymology and biotechnology experts.
hydraulics	purpose of review this review shows that a more or less constant rate of tip-to-base vessel widening across species, together with the assumption that wider vessels are more vulnerable to embolism, suggests how climate should limit maximum vegetation height; together, these two factors predict a maximum mean vessel diameter permitted by temperature and water availability at a site and thus maximum plant height. recent findings empirical work makes it increasingly clear that the main driver of variation in mean vessel diameter is plant size, specifically the length of the conductive stream. anatomical evidence, together with hydraulic optimality models, suggests that this vessel diameter-stem length relationship is the result of natural selection favoring the maintenance of constant hydraulic resistance over size increases. from their very narrow termini, vessels widen predictably from the stem tip to the base, following approximately a power law, i. e., with very rapid widening toward the tips and nearly constant diameter toward the base. this size dependence must be taken into account when studying the hydraulics-climate relationship. summary this review discusses outstanding predictions that require testing, including the following: variation in the vessel diameter-stem length relationship should involve factors such as vessel length distributions, pit characteristics, leaf area, and wood density; leaves higher in trees should have higher terminal leaf vein-petiole base vessel widening rates; species without ""disposable"" units (e. g., columnar cacti) might have different widening rates; and within-plant widening rate should vary as plants approach their height limits. finally, we emphasize the need to standardize for size in making comparisons of vessel diameter variation.
hydraulics	laboratory experiments were conducted in order to investigate the effectiveness of a new scour countermeasure consisting of a horizontal extension plate (ep) downstream of a gated spillway-stilling basin structure. these experiments were performed on a 1:30 scale model of one of the south florida water management district (sfwmd) gated spillway structures, the s65e gated spillway, because it has experienced worrisome downstream scour. currently, riprap is the only scour countermeasure documented for these structures. eps of various lengths were installed downstream of the stilling basin, and the equilibrium scour was measured. it was found that a plate length of approximately 1.88 times the exiting flow depth was the shortest length that resulted in significant scour reduction and downstream scour translation. measured flow patterns reveal that the ep altered the flow patterns by transferring the plunging flow downstream and eliminating the near-bed reattachment and surface recirculation, possibly due to a decreased interaction between the plunging flow and the stilling basin face.
manufacturing_engineering	the lack of hands-on experiences in specific manufacturing processes has been identified as one of the major competency gaps in manufacturing engineering education. partly in response to this, funding agencies like sme education foundation (smeef) and the national science foundation (nsf) have supported efforts to address this issue. this paper describes the manufacturing integrated learning lab (mill), which is an outcome of these efforts. mill is an nsf funded multi-institutional project, whose focus is the development of a hands-on approach to manufacturing education. this offers students skills that directly prepare them for careers in manufacturing, design and product realization. four knowledge areas with corresponding detailed learning outcomes were identified for study namely: (1) drafting/design, (2) manufacturing process, (3) process engineering, and (4) cad/cam. based on these, a core curriculum shared between the partner institutions was developed. this encapsulates the mill manufacturing competency model. assessment instruments to measure student learning were also developed. sample test items were developed for all competencies in a series of internal meetings held among mill project staff. the preliminary results from a field test indicate high levels of student achievement under the mill paradigm, and excellent structure of the assessment instruments.
genetics	hybrids are generally less fit than their parental species, and the mechanisms underlying their fitness reductions can manifest through different traits. for example, hybrids can have physiological, behavioral, or ecological defects, and these defects can generate reproductive isolation between their parental species. however, the rate that mechanisms of postzygotic isolation other than hybrid sterility and inviability evolve has remained largely uninvestigated, despite isolated studies showing that behavioral defects in hybrids are not only possible but might be widespread. here, we study a fundamental animal-behavior the ability of individuals to find food-and test the rate at which it breaks down in hybrids. we measured the ability of hybrids from 94 pairs of drosophila species to find food and show that this ability decreases with increasing genetic divergence between the parental species and that male hybrids are more strongly (and negatively) affected than females. our findings quantify the rate that hybrid dysfunction evolves across the diverse radiation of drosophila and highlights the need for future investigations of the genetic and neurological mechanisms that affect a hybrid 's ability to find a suitable substrate on which to feed and breed.
molecular_biology	background: crustaceans have been studied extensively as model systems for nervous system function from single neuron properties to behavior. however, lack of molecular sequence information and tools have slowed the adoption of these physiological systems as molecular model systems. in this study, we sequenced and performed de novo assembly for the nervous system transcriptomes of two decapod crustaceans: the jonah crab (cancer borealis) and the american lobster (homarus americanus). results: forty-two thousand, seven hundred sixty-six and sixty thousand, two hundred seventy-three contigs were assembled from c. borealis and h. americanus respectively, representing 9,489 and 11,061 unique coding sequences. from these transcripts, genes associated with neural function were identified and manually curated to produce a characterization of multiple gene families important for nervous system function. this included genes for 34 distinct ion channel types, 17 biogenic amine and 5 gaba receptors, 28 major transmitter receptor subtypes including glutamate and acetylcholine receptors, and 6 gap junction proteins - the innexins. conclusion: with this resource, crustacean model systems are better poised for incorporation of modern genomic and molecular biology technologies to further enhance the interrogation of fundamentals of nervous system function.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the present study aimed to investigate the effect of dickkopf-related protein 3 (dkk3) on osteogenic differentiation of rat dental follicle cells (decs). a pcr array analysis of wnt pathway activation in decs identified genes dysregulated by mineral induction. among them, dkk3expression levels were decreased, and further experiments were conducted to investigate its role in dec osteogenesis. by comparing decs grown in normal growth and mineral-induction media for 4 weeks, the present study confirmed that dkk3 was a potential target gene of osteogenesis through reverse transcliption-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-gpcr) and western blotting (wb). a short hairpin rna (shrna) was introduced into decs using a lentiviral vector to inhibit dkk3 expression. an alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity assay and alizarin red staining were performed to observe the dkk3-shrna decs. in addition, the osteogenic differentiation of dkk3-shrna decs was analyzed by rt-gpcr and wb. in vivo, dkk3-shrna decs seeded on hydroxyapatiteip-tricalcium phosphate (ha/tcp) scaffolds were transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, followed by hematoxylin-eosin and masson staining. the results confirmed that dkk3 expression was downregulated during mineral induction in rat decs. lentivirus-mediated expression of dkk3 shrna in decs promoted calcified-nodule formation, alp activity and the expression of p-catenin, runt-related transcription factor 2 and osteocalcin, compared with control cells. in vivo, the implanted section presented the majority of newly formed osteoid matrices and collagen, with limited space between the ha/tcp scaffolds and matrices. in conclusion, dkk3 expression negatively regulates the osteogenic differentiation of decs and, conversely, downregulation of dkk3 may enhance dec osteogenesis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	classical contagious caprine pleuropneumonia is one of the most fatal contagious disease of goats listed by world organization for animal health that leads to major economic losses. it is caused by infection with mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae. in order to isolate the causative agents of ccpp for the first time in the kingdom of saudi arabia, fifteen flocks from eastern region (al ahsa, dammam and hafr albaten) and ten flocks from riyadh and al-kharj regions were selected for this study. a total of 700 samples (400 nasal swabs, 300 pleural fluid samples and lung samples (from necropsied animals)) were collected from goats showing typical signs of ccpp. the clinical signs of diseased cases revealed serous to mucoid nasal discharge, coughing, dyspnea, frothy salivation, and fever (40-42 degrees c). necropsied animals showed fibrinous pleuropneumonia and increased pleural fluid. of 400 nasal swabs, 190 pleural fluid, and 110 lung samples, 26 (6.5%), 31 (16.3%) and 19 (17.3%) mycoplasma isolates were recovered, respectively. biochemically, all isolates were sensitive to digitonin and fermented glucose. sixty seven of mycoplasma isolates were belonged to mycoplasma mycoides cluster based on detection of 16s rrna. polymerase chain reaction screening of mycoplasma isolates using specific primer for m. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae confirmed 55 isolates to be m. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae.

genetics	background: in periodontitis, genetics and smoking play important roles in host immune system response. the aim of this study is to determine whether the genetic background of initial periodontitis and caries could be detected using an active matrix metalloproteinase (ammp)-8 chairside test in finnish adolescents. methods: forty-seven participants gave approval for analysis of both oral fluid collection and dna. an ammp-8 chairside test was performed on participants (adolescents aged 15 to 17 years), and full-mouth clinical parameters of oral health were assessed including periodontal, oral mucosal, and caries status in eastern finland from 2014 to 2015. dna was extracted from oral fluid samples and genotyped for 71 polymorphisms in 29 candidate genes for periodontitis. results were analyzed using a logistic regression model. p values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate (= 4 mm pockets were associated with vitamin d receptor (vdr) (rs2228570, p = 0.002, q = 0.04) and mmp3 (rs520540, rs639752, rs679620, p = 0.0009, 0.003, 0.003, q = 0.04, respectively). none of the other single-nucleotide polymorphisms studied showed a significant association with the ammp-8 chairside test and at least one caries lesion positivity. conclusion: genetic polymorphisms of mmp3 and vdr are linked to initial periodontitis in finnish adolescents, and the ammp-8 chairside test can eventually detect initial periodontitis in young patients with predisposing genetic background.
immunology	since the european union enforced the ban on antibiotic growth promoters in 2006, the research has been focused on natural feed additives which would have a proven positive impact on both production and animal health. inulin is both the most commonly used and the most effective probiotic additive. the mechanism of inulin interactions with the avian body is complex, multidirectional and not fully understood. despite a number of unresolved issues, many authors have demonstrated the positive impact of inulin on the host organism. dietary supplementation of poultry feeding with inulin contributes to the modulation of intestinal microbiota through favouring a quick proliferation of beneficial bifidobacterium and lactobacillus strains and inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes. there are indications that inulin-provoked changes in the host gut microbiota in poultry may alter the structure and histomorphology of the intestinal mucosa and improve its absorption capacity in poultry. it has also been demonstrated that inulin may affect the immune system and the systemic metabolism of minerals and lipids. the reports on inulin effects on the body and performance of poultry are often contradictory, as the effectiveness of this prebiotic is strongly dependent on the type and dose used, and the duration of its administration.
genetics	despite tremendous progress in finding genes that, when manipulated, affects lifespan, little is known about the genetics underlying natural variation in lifespan. while segregating genetic variants for lifespan has been notoriously difficult to find in genome-wide association studies (gwas), a complementary approach is to manipulate key genetic pathways in lines that differ in lifespan. if these candidate pathways are down regulated in long-lived lines, these lines can be predicted to respond less to pharmaceutical down-regulation of these pathways than short-lived lines. experimental studies have identified the nutrient-sensing pathway tor as a key regulator of lifespan in model organisms, and this pathway can effectively be down regulated using the drug rapamycin, which extends lifespan in all tested species. we expose short-and long-lived lines of the nematode caenorhabditis remanei to rapamycin, and investigate if long-lived lines, which are hypothesized to already have down-regulated tor signaling, respond less to rapamycin. we found no interaction between line and rapamycin treatment, since rapamycin extended lifespan independent of the intrinsic lifespan of the lines. this shows that rapamycin is equally effective on long and short-lived lines, and suggests that the evolution of long life may involve more factors that down-regulation of tor.

thermodynamics	the competitiveness of the second-generation bioethanol by biotechnological process requires an effective and quantitative control of biochemical reactions. in this study, the potential of isothermal calorimetry technique to measure heat and kinetics of a non-homogeneous substrate enzymatic hydrolysis is intended. using this technique, optimum temperature of the enzymes used for lignocellulosic molecules hydrolysis was determined. thus, the amount of substrate-to-enzyme ratio was highlighted as an important parameter of the hydrolysis yield. furthermore, a new enzymes' cocktail efficiency consisting of a mix of cellulases and cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) was qualified by this technique. the results showed that this cocktail allowed the production of a high amount of gluconic acid that could improve the attractiveness of these second-generation biofuels. from the set of experiments, the hydrolysis heat of wheat straw was derived and a meaningful value of -32.2 +/- 3.2 j g(-1) (gram reducing sugars product) is calculated. then, isothermal measurements were used to determine kinetic constants of the cellulases and cdh mix on wheat straw. results showed that this enzyme cocktail has an optimal rate at 45 a degrees c in the range of temperatures tested (40-55 a degrees c).
strength_of_materials	membrane structures are very lightweight and highly optimized structures. due to the constant stress state, strength of materials is used optimally. in order to prevent the occurrence of large deformations even for small external loads, membrane structures are designed as a double curved surfaces and are stabilized by applying prestress. minimal surfaces has zero mean curvature and the basic advantage is that the stress at all points and directions is equal and there are no extreme stresses anywhere on the surface. also have minimal area for the given contour, so the weight and amount of material is reduced to minimum, which make them suitable for application in architecture. practical realization involve process of cutting pattern generation, which divide surfaces in parts that are developable surfaces. when patterns are assembled and prestressed they provide three-dimensional surface. ideally, the cutting lines should follow the geodesics lines. we use geodesics as the shortest path between two points on a surface. in the article we give method for finding shortest paths on polygonal representations of surfaces follows continual dijkstra paradigm which, on some conditions, can give improved accuracy on a computer despite the restriction of available memory and execution time.
manufacturing_engineering	given the varied benefits of using the simulation packages such as; cost efficiency, time, risk mitigation, greater insights and user friendliness of systems. it has been extensively used in many application domains such as defense, airports, manufacturing, engineering, and healthcare. currently, due to the increasing numbers of simulation software packages available in the market, it is often challenging to choose a suitable package that meets users' demands. researchers have leveraged many assessment methods and techniques to facilitate the evaluation and selection process of the simulation packages. this paper provides a survey corroborated from researcher 's contributions to simplify the selection process of simulation packages. also, discerns the evaluation methods and techniques for simulation packages found in the literature.

fluid_mechanics	a large amount of methane releasing from the residual coal and the surrounding pressure-relieved gas bearing strata may accumulate in the longwall gob of gas-bearing coal seam, which is increasingly exploited as a major source of coalbed methane (cbm) development in coal mining areas. meanwhile, if the gob methane emits into the working space along with air-leakage flow, they may impair the safety and productivity of underground coal mines. thus, gob gas drainage is of great significance to both the cbm development and the control of gob gas emission. currently, there exist two major technologies for gob gas drainage gob gas ventholes (ggvs) drainage and underground drainage (such as high-level suction tunnels, high-located boreholes and buried pipes in the upper-corner). in practical engineering applications, the ggvs. have greater advantage over the traditional underground drainage in the extraction flux of gob gas and the control of gob gas emission, but the theoretical mechanism of ggvs has not yet been revealed in previous studies. consequently, the characteristics of gob gas flow with ggvs drainage needs further research. in this paper, the numerical simulation of gas flow in gob gas reservoirs and the in-situ assessment of ggvs drainage are carried out to investigate the mechanism of the control of gob gas flow with ggvs drainage. firstly, based on fluid mechanics in porous media the mathematical model of gob gas transport is developed. then, the gas pressure distribution, gas flow patterns and methane concentration distribution in the gob under the conditions of no drainage measures, drainage with buried pipe in the upper corner and ggvs in different locations are discussed by conducting numerical simulation, respectively. in addition, the influence of distance between ggv and return airway on the gob methane flow and the strong control scope of ggvs are analyzed in detail. it is found that: 1) ggvs has the ""flow-interception effect"" on the gas in the deep zone of the gob and the ""flow-reversal effect"" on the gas in the gob close to the longwall face, which accounts for that ggvs drainage advantage over underground drainage. 2) ggvs can be applied to drain the gas in the deep zone of the gob massively and to control the gob gas migration effectively, so they are a top choice for the extraction of gob gas and the control of gob gas emission. finally, both ggvs drainage and underground drainage are adopted to extract gob gas in east-102 working face in weijiadi coal mine. the comparison of the extracted and emitted volume of gob gas with two different technologies shows that, ggv can drain the gob gas with greater flux and can better control the gob gas emission, which validated the prediction of numerical stimulation.

fluid_mechanics	for thermal mixed-convection flows, the nusselt number is a function of reynolds number, grashof number and the angle between the forced-and natural-convection directions. we consider flow over a heated cylinder for which there is no universal correlation that accurately predicts nusselt number as a function of these parameters, especially in opposing-convection flows, where the natural convection is against the forced convection. here, we revisit this classical problem by employing modern tools from machine learning to develop a general multi-fidelity framework for constructing a stochastic response surface for the nusselt number. in particular, we combine previously developed experimental correlations (low-fidelity model) with direct numerical simulations (high-fidelity model) using gaussian process regression and autoregressive stochastic schemes. in this framework the high-fidelity model is sampled only a few times, while the inexpensive empirical correlation is sampled at a very high rate. we obtain the mean nusselt number directly from the stochastic multi-fidelity response surface, and we also propose an improved correlation. this new correlation seems to be consistent with the physics of this problem as we correct the vectorial addition of forced and natural convection with a pre-factor that weighs differently the forced convection. this, in turn, results in a new definition of the effective reynolds number, hence accounting for the 'incomplete similarity' between mixed convection and forced convection. in addition, due to the probabilistic construction, we can quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. this information-fusion framework is useful for elucidating the physics of the flow, especially in cases where anomalous transport or interesting dynamics may be revealed by contrasting the variable fidelity across the models. while in this paper we focus on the thermal mixed convection, the multi-fidelity framework provides a new paradigm that could he used in many different contexts in fluid mechanics including heat and mass transport, but also in combining various levels of fidelity of models of turbulent flows.
enzymology	the termination module of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps) and polyketide synthases (pks) off-loads the final product as an acid (occasionally also accompanied by cyclization) upon hydrolysis by employing thioesterase domains (te-domains). reductase domains (r-domains) of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (sdr) family offer an alternative offloading mechanism by reducing 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-ppant) arm-tethered peptidyl chain, a thioester, to an aldehyde or an alcohol. recent studies have highlighted their functional importance, for instance in the glycopeptidolipid (gpl) biosynthesis of mycobacterium smegmatis, where the resulting alcoholic group is the site for subsequent modifications such as glycosylations. the mechanistic understanding of how these r-domains function in the context of multi-modular nrps and pks is poorly understood. in this study, conformational differences in functionally important loops, not reported previously, were identified in a new crystal form of r-domain which may be relevant to functioning in the context of assembly-line nrps and pks enzymology. here, we propose a concerted loop movement model that allows gating of cofactor binding to these enzymes, enabling the release of the final product only after the substrate has reached the active site during biosynthesis, and therefore distinct from a canonical single domain sdr family of enzymes.

manufacturing_engineering	non-destructive controls particularly, x-rays computed tomography (xr-ct) is a useful tool in manufacturing engineering applications in the modern industry to study the texture deformation of mechanical parts with an efficient way. in manufacturing processes, the relationships between the mechanical properties of the materials and their structure and also their composition are crucial for the design of the mechanical parts because they basically influence the general behaviour of these parts in service conditions. therefore, the great interest of xr-ct is the possibility of viewing with high resolution a transversal plane of an object without destroying the controlled parts. moreover, x-ray tomography supplants the ultra sound by its spatial resolution and by its attenuation measure which are well adapted for the study of the material. this paper gives a comparative study on the new developments in non-destructive controls of the composite materials and applications in the manufacturing engineering and also reviews essentially the performance and advantages of x-rays computed tomography (xr-ct) medical scanner about its usage at multiple scales (macro, micro, meso and nano), the method and also the terminology. subsequently, it will deal with the chosen materials to share the performances of this technique for the very different industrial applications.

molecular_biology	beyond the universality of the symmetry concept, there are different emphases on its application in different branches of science. chemistry, being between particle physics and astrophysics, represents a bridge in, and a utilitarian approach to, the application of the symmetry concept, which has proved immensely fruitful in twentieth-century science. some pivotal discoveries, especially in structural chemistry, molecular biology, and materials science, emerged by relaxing some of the stipulations of the classical teachings about symmetry. this highly personal presentation relies on ideas expressed by a number of notable individuals in recent science, among them j. desmond bernal, francis crick, ronald j. gillespie, aleksandr i. kitaigorodskii, alan l. mackay, george a. olah, linus pauling, roger penrose, dan shechtman, james d. watson, steven weinberg, and eugene p. wigner.
human_metabolism	xylitol, a five carbon sugar alcohol, occurs widely in nature but it is also a normal intermediate in human metabolism. as an alternative sweetener, it is recommended for diabetics and for the prevention of dental caries. xylitol is currently produced chemically on a large scale. microbial production is lately becoming more attractive since the downstream processing is expected to be cheaper. among microorganisms, yeasts are the best xylitol producers, particularly those belonging to the genus candida. the key enzymes for xylitol production in yeasts are d-xylose reductase which, using either nadh or nadph, reduces d-xylose to xylitol, and predominantly, nad-linked xylitol dehydrogenase which reoxidizes xylitol to d-xylulose. xylitol accumulation in yeasts is sensitive to environmental conditions such as nutrition, temperature, ph, inoculum, substrate and aeration, with the last two being critical for yeast growth and fermentation. hemicellulosic hydrolysates derived from hardwood and particularly from agricultural residues, such as sugar cane bagasse, corn cabs, wheat and rice straw, are used as feedstock for xylitol production. due to the presence of inhibitory components, some of the hydrolysates have to be treated prior to microbial utilization. the most investigated types of processes have been batch ones, although fed-batch and immobilized systems have been characterized by the highest yields and productivities. apart from the naturally occurring yeasts, recombinant strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae in free and immobilized form were also investigated for xylitol production.
northern_blotting	glycogen and trehalose are important energy source and key regulation factors in the development of many organisms pass through energy metabolism, including bacteria, fungi, and insects. to study glycogen metabolism pathway in spodoptera exigua, first cdnas for glycogen synthase (spoexgs) and glycogen phosphorylase (spoexgp) were cloned from s. exigua. spoexgs cdna contains an open reading frame of 2,010 nucleotides encoding a protein of 669 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 76.19 kda and a pi of 5.84. spoexgp contains an open reading frame of 2,946 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 841 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 96.63 kda and a pi of 6.03. second, northern blotting revealed that spoexgs and spoexgp mrnas were expressed in brain, fat body, mid-gut, malpighian tubules, spermary, and tracheae of s. exigua. expression patterns for spoexgs and spoexgp mrnas were similar in fat body, but differed in whole body at different developmental stages. the last, under starvation conditions, spoexgs and spoexgp transcript expression rapidly decreased with increasing starvation time. when the starvation stress was removed, spoexgs and spoexgp mrna levels were lower in the groups starved for 6 and 12 h than in the 24-h starvation and control groups. treatment with excessive sugar intake led to higher levels of spoexgs and spoexgp transcripts after 12 h compared to the control group. these findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns, and potential function of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase proteins.

human_metabolism	obesity is a major problem and maintaining a healthy diet and body weight has become increasingly important. insulin is a known biomarker for the human metabolism, and measuring insulin may thus help inform decisions about diet choices. this provides a strong motivation to develop a fast, cheap, sensitive and easy to use home biosensor for insulin. here we discuss the challenges and trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range, analysis times, instrumentation and sample transport and storage requirements for different biosensor development approaches. we show that the sensitivity of conventional spr with a lower limit of detection of 0.5 nm is too low for practical purposes. label-free antibody and aptamer carbon nanotube based systems suffer from lack of specificity. highest sensitivity is afforded by mesoscale and phase monitoring electrochemical impedance spectroscopy assays with detection limits in the fm range, currently available only in a laboratory setting. thus, a home-based insulin dip-stick is yet to be developed. [graphics] biosensing traces and structure of insulin: an important molecule to be quantified with role in obesity and diabetes.
cell_biology	small gtp-hydrolyzing enzymes (gtpases) of the rhoa family play manifold roles in cell biology and are regulated by upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factors (gefs). herein, we focus on the gefs of the vav subfamily. vav1 was originally described as a proto-oncogene of the hematopoietic lineage. the gefs vav2 and vav3 are more broadly expressed in various tissues. in particular, the gef vav3 may play important roles in the developing nervous system during the differentiation of neural stem cells into the major lineages, namely neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. we discuss its putative regulatory roles for progenitor differentiation in the developing retina, polarization of neurons and formation of synapses, migration of oligodendrocyte progenitors and establishment of myelin sheaths. we propose that vav3 mediates the response of various neural cell types to environmental cues.
northern_blotting	escherichia coli is able to utilize d-ribose as its sole carbon source. the genes for the transport and initial-step metabolism of d-ribose form a single rbsdacbk operon. rbsabc forms the abc-type high-affinity d-ribose transporter, while rbsd and rbsk are involved in the conversion of d-ribose into d-ribose 5-phosphate. in the absence of inducer d-ribose, the ribose operon is repressed by a laci-type transcription factor rbsr, which is encoded by a gene located downstream of this ribose operon. at present, the rbs operon is believed to be the only target of regulation by rbsr. after genomic selex screening, however, we have identified that rbsr binds not only to the rbs promoter but also to the promoters of a set of genes involved in purine nucleotide metabolism. northern blotting analysis indicated that rbsr represses the purhd operon for de novo synthesis of purine nucleotide but activates the add and udk genes involved in the salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis. taken together, we propose that rbsr is a global regulator for switch control between the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and its salvage pathway.
enzymology	prokaryotes form ubiquitin (ub)-like isopeptide bonds on the lysine residues of proteins by at least two distinct pathways that are reversible and regulated. in mycobacteria, the c-terminal gln of pup (prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein) is deamidated and isopeptide linked to proteins by a mechanism distinct from ubiquitylation in enzymology yet analogous to ubiquitylation in targeting proteins for destruction by proteasomes. ub-fold proteins of archaea (samps, small archaeal modifier proteins) and thermus (ttub, trna-two-thiouridine b) that differ from ub in amino acid sequence, yet share a common beta-grasp fold, also form isopeptide bonds by a mechanism that appears streamlined compared with ubiquitylation. samps and ttub are found to be members of a small group of ub-fold proteins that function not only in protein modification but also in sulfur-transfer pathways associated with trna thiolation and molybdopterin biosynthesis. these multifunctional ub-fold proteins are thought to be some of the most ancient of ub-like protein modifiers.
northern_blotting	background: in cat visual cortex, critical period neuronal plasticity is minimal until approximately 3 postnatal weeks, peaks at 5 weeks, gradually declines to low levels at 20 weeks, and disappears by 1 year of age. dark rearing slows the entire time course of this critical period, such that at 5 weeks of age, normal cats are more plastic than dark reared cats, whereas at 20 weeks, dark reared cats are more plastic. thus, a stringent criterion for identifying genes that are important for plasticity in visual cortex is that they show differences in expression between normal and dark reared that are of opposite direction in young versus older animals. results: the present study reports the identification by differential display pcr of a novel gene, alpha-chimaerin, as a candidate visual cortex critical period plasticity gene that showed bidirectional regulation of expression due to age and dark rearing. northern blotting confirmed the bidirectional expression and 5'race sequencing identified the gene. there are two alternatively-spliced alpha-chimaerin isoforms: alpha 1 and alpha 2. western blotting extended the evidence for bidirectional regulation of visual cortex alpha-chimaerin isoform expression to protein in cats and mice. alpha 1- and alpha 2-chimaerin were elevated in dark reared compared to normal visual cortex at the peak of the normal critical period and in normal compared to dark reared visual cortex at the nadir of the normal critical period. analysis of variance showed a significant interaction in both cats and mice for both alpha-chimaerin isoforms, indicating that the effect of dark rearing depended on age. this differential expression was not found in frontal cortex. conclusions: chimaerins are rhogtpase-activating proteins that are epha4 effectors and have been implicated in a number of processes including growth cone collapse, axon guidance, dendritic spine development and the formation of corticospinal motor circuits. the present results identify alpha-chimaerin as a candidate molecule for a role in the postnatal critical period of visual cortical plasticity.
materials_engineering	increasingly, it is recognised that the abundant resources of evolutionized biological materials and structures provide an exciting opportunity for growth in the area of materials engineering for impact and projectile resistance. a bio-inspired cellular structural system is developed to contain the radial fracture damage of mortar due to projectile impact through boundary impedance mismatch, while utilizing its adjacent cells as a mutual confining mechanism to improve penetration resistance. the penetration resistance was evaluated on a hexagon cell which is confined mutually by six other identical neighbouring cells in a rigid mould and subjected to a 7.77 g, 8 mm diameter, aisi4140 high strength steel projectile impact at similar to 450 m/s. three cell sizes (50 mm, 70 mm and 90 mm) with two types of cellular interface material (air and silicone) were investigated. these were then compared against monolithically cast mortar control specimens of their respective sizes. it was found that the cellular design was effective in significantly reducing the radial damage for an incoming projectile by up to 26%, with a modest increase in penetration depth of up to 12%. furthermore, specimens with silicon as the cellular interface material demonstrated a 33% reduction in proximal crater damage across all specimen sizes tested, with up to 10% increase in penetration depth. numerical simulations using ls-dyna in 3d quarter-symmetry has also led to better understanding of the physical shockwave interactions modified by a cellular design, allowed verification of the experimental results and supported the authors' explanations of the physical phenomena. overall, penetration depths and crater diameters were within 10% and 20% of the experimental results respectively. this research has useful field applications when extensive radial damage is costly to repair, and penetration resistance is not the most critical consideration.

cell_biology	most prokaryote-secreted proteins are transported to the cell surface using either the general secretion (sec) or twin-arginine translocation (tat) pathway. a majority of secreted proteins are anchored to the cell surface, while the remainder are released into the extracellular environment. the anchored surface proteins play a variety of important roles in cellular processes, ranging from facilitating interactions between cells to maintaining cell stability. the extensively studied s-layer glycoprotein (slg) of haloferax volcanii, previously thought to be anchored via c-terminal intercalation into the membrane, was recently shown to be lipidated and to have its c-terminal segment removed in processes dependent upon archaeosortase a (arta), a recently discovered enzyme. while slg is a sec substrate, in silico analyses presented here reveal that, of eight additional arta substrates predicted, two substrates also contain predicted tat signal peptides, including hvo_0405, which has a highly conserved tripartite structure that lies closer to the center of the protein than to its c terminus, unlike other predicted arta substrates identified to date. we demonstrate that, even given its atypical location, this tripartite structure, which likely resulted from the fusion of genes encoding an arta substrate and a cytoplasmic protein, is processed in an arta-dependent manner. using an hvo_0405 mutant lacking the conserved ""twin"" arginines of the predicted tat signal peptide, we show that hvo_0405 is indeed a tat substrate and that arta substrates include both sec and tat substrates. finally, we confirmed the tat-dependent localization and signal peptidase i (spase i) cleavage site of hvo_0405 using mass spectrometry. importance the specific mechanisms that facilitate protein anchoring to the archaeal cell surface remain poorly understood. here, we have shown that the proteins bound to the cell surface of the model archaeon h. volcanii, through a recently discovered novel arta-dependent anchoring mechanism, are more structurally diverse than was previously known. specifically, our results demonstrate that both tat and sec substrates, which contain the conserved tripartite structure of predicted arta substrates, can be processed in an arta-dependent manner and that the tripartite structure need not lie near the c terminus for this processing to occur. these data improve our understanding of archaeal cell biology and are invaluable for in silico subcellular localization predictions of archaeal and bacterial proteins.
molecular_biology	this study aims to investigate the impacts of a digital learning module with guided peer feedback on students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change in the field of biotechnology and molecular life sciences. the extent to which the use of this module is appreciated by students is studied as well. a pre-test, post-test design was used with 203 students who were randomly assigned to groups of three. they were asked to work on the digital module with the aim of exploring various perspectives, and the pros and cons on the topic of genetically modified organisms (gmos). the results suggest that the module can be used to foster students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change. furthermore, the module was evaluated positively in terms of students' motivation and satisfaction with the learning experiences.

computer-aided_design	in this study, a new algorithm for discrimination between internal faults and inrush current conditions in power transformers is presented. first, the proposed algorithm removes the pre-fault conditions of the fault currents. then, those currents are processed using the discrete wavelet transform to obtain the wavelet matrix. the correlation matrix is computed from wavelet matrix to know the eigenvalues associated with each frequency scale and to reduce the analysed information. this algorithm, which the authors are going to call wavelet correlation modes, is used to identify inrush and internal fault currents in power transformer. to validate the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out in power systems computer-aided design software, and the obtained signals are analysed in order to evaluate its performance and sensitivity.
strength_of_materials	polyurethane-modified epoxy resin was prepared with polyurethane prepolymer(pup). the effects of the pup content and epoxy resin type on mechanical and thermal properties of materials were discussed. the results indicate that the tensile strength and impact strength of the material increase to maximum successively, and then decrease with the increasing addition of pup. when the mass fraction of pup was 15%, the tensile strength and the impact strength of materials were all the best. there were significant differences in mechanical and thermal properties of material for different epoxy, and the best results were cured epoxy tde-85.
computer-aided_design	we present a novel numerical method to simulate crack growth in 3d, directly from the computer-aided design (cad) geometry of the component, without any mesh generation. the method is an isogeometric boundary element method (igabem) based on non-uniform rational b-splines (nurbs). nurbs basis functions are used for the domain and crack representation as well as to approximate the physical quantities involved in the simulations. a stable quadrature scheme for singular integration is proposed to enhance the robustness of the method in dealing with highly distorted elements. convergence studies in the crack opening displacement is performed for a ""penny-shaped crack and an elliptical crack. two approaches to extract stress intensity factors (sifs): the contour m integral and the virtual crack closure integral are compared using dual integral equations. the results show remarkable accuracy in the computed sifs, leading to smooth crack paths and reliable fatigue lives, without requiring the generation of any mesh from the cad model of the component under consideration.

fluid_mechanics	this paper presents a numerical approximation technique for the boltzmann equation based on a moment-system approximation in velocity dependence and a discontinuous galerkin finite-element approximation in position dependence. the closure relation for the moment systems derives from minimization of a suitable go-divergence. this divergence-based closure yields a hierarchy of tractable symmetric hyperbolic moment systems that retain the fundamental structural properties of the boltzmann equation. the approximation in position dependence is based on the discontinuous galerkin finite-element method. the resulting combined discontinuous galerkin moment method corresponds to a galerkin approximation of the boltzmann equation in renormalized form. the new moment-closure formulation engenders a new upwind numerical flux function, based on half-space integrals of the approximate distribution. we establish that the proposed upwind flux ensures entropy dissipation of the discontinuous galerkin finite element approximation. numerical results are presented for a one-dimensional test case.

cell_biology	drosophila ovary is recognized as one of the best model systems to study stem cell biology in vivo. we had previously identified an autonomous role of the histone hi in germline stem cell (gsc) maintenance. here, we found that histone h1 depletion in escort cells (ecs) resulted in an increase of spectrosome-containing cells (sccs), an ovary tumor-like phenotype. further analysis showed that the dpp pathway is excessively activated in these scc cells, while the expression of bam is attenuated. in the h1-depleted ecs, both transposon activity and dna damage had increased dramatically, followed by ec apoptosis, which is consistent with the role of h1 in other somatic cells. surprisingly, h1-depleted ecs acquired cap cell characteristics including dpp expression, and the resulting abnormal dpp level inhibits scc further differentiation. most interestingly, double knockdown of h1 and dpp in ecs can reduce the number of sccs to the normal level, indicating that the additional dpp secreted by ecs contributes to the germline tumor. taken together, our findings indicate that histone h1 is an important epigenetic factor in controlling ec characteristics and a key suppressor of germline tumor.
thermodynamics	two new zinc(ii)-2-chlorophenylacetate complexes, {[zn(2-cl-c6h4ch2coo)(2)(phen)](2-cl-c6h4ch2cooh)(2), 1 and [zn(2-cl-c6h4ch2coo)(2)(bipy)](2-cl-c6h4ch2cooh)(2), 2} with nitrogen donor ligands, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy), were synthesized and characterized by ir spectroscopy and single crystal diffraction. distorted octahedral geometry was confirmed in both complexes. the compounds were studied for the thermal stabilities using tg and dta methods at different heating rates (283, 288 and 293 k min(-1)). it was found that both the complexes show the same trend in stabilities and thermally degrade in two stages. the apparent activation energies for each step of specific conversions were determined using the doyle-ozawa calculation method according to ictac recommendations. the calculated average activation energies for 1 were found to be 17.52/10.19 j mol(-1) for the first and second stages of degradation, respectively. similarly, for 2 corresponding values for the two-stage degradation were found to be 12.45 and 3.485 j mol(-1). determining the enthalpy value of the activation revealed an exergonic nature of the thermal degradation.
genetics	several major market operators argue that the current level of knowledge about quality is too scant to justify a switch to a large-scale production of triploid salmon. the aim of the present study was, therefore, to elucidate how rearing conditions (5, 10 and 15 degrees c) affect the flesh quality of triploid atlantic salmon (salmo solar l, 1.6 +/- 0.3 kg). as a reference, diploid salmon kept under equal conditions and with equal genetics were used. the main design discriminant was the holding temperature; increased temperature gave increased blood lactate, rigor index (i-r), drip loss (dl), content of astaxanthin and intensity of redness, but reduced muscle ph, cathepsin activity and fillet lightness. salmon kept at 10 degrees c grew the fastest. it is concluded that ploidy gave less variation than temperature. triploids were characterized by lower blood haernatocrit (hct) and i-r higher dl and collagenase activity, and on average, paler and less yellowish fillets.

human_metabolism	in human in-vitro fertilization (ivf), embryos are routinely transferred to the uterus on either day 2 or day 3 of development, resulting in a 10-15% implantation rate. however, in other mammalian species, the transfer of cleavage stage embryos, which normally reside in the oviduct, to the uterus results in a significantly lower implantation rate compared with blastocysts. it is therefore proposed that, in order to increase implantation rates in human ivf, one has to move to extended culture and transfer at the blastocyst stage. the transfer of blastocysts will not only help synchronize the embryo with the female tract but will facilitate the identification of those embryos with little or no developmental potential. in order to culture viable blastocysts it is important to use more than one culture medium to cater for the changing requirements of the preimplantation embryo as it develops and differentiates. if sequential culture media are not used, one can obtain blastocysts but their resultant viability is low the use of sequential serum-free media in human ivf has resulted in >50% of embryos becoming blastocysts with an implantation rate of similar to 50%. further advances in human embryo culture should come from the replacement of protein with the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronate, which is more suitable than albumin in supporting implantation in the mouse, and which will eliminate biological variation and possible contamination from blood products. with the routine culture of human blastocysts will come the introduction of non-invasive tests of embryo viability, capable of identifying those blastocysts most likely to develop from a given cohort. as the implantation rate of blastocysts is higher than that of the cleavage stage embryo, fewer embryos will be required for transfer in order to establish a successful pregnancy, thereby reducing the number of multiple gestations and increasing the overall efficiency of human ivf.
molecular_biology	the gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase 7b (cbh7b) of the thermophilic fungus thielavia terrestris was identified, subcloned, and expressed in pichia pastoris. cbh7b encoded 455 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 51.8 kda. domain analysis indicated that cbh7b contains a family 7 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic core but lacks a carbohydrate-binding module. purified cbh7b exhibited optimum catalytic activity at ph 5.0 and 55 degrees c with 4-methylumbelliferryl-cellobioside as the substrate and retained 85% of its activity following 24 h incubation at 50 degrees c. despite the lack of activity toward microcrystalline substrates, this enzyme worked synergistically with the commercial enzyme cocktail cellic((r)) ctec2 to enhance saccharification by 39% when added to a reaction mixture containing 0.25% alkaline pretreated oil palm empty fruit bunch (opefb). attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested a reduction of lignin and crystalline cellulose in opefb samples supplemented with cbh7b. scanning electron microscopy revealed greater destruction extent of opefb strands in samples supplemented with cbh7b as compared with the nonsupplemented control. therefore, cbh7b has the potential to complement commercial enzymes in hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass.

materials_engineering	natural cellulose-based fibers offer low cost, low density composite reinforcement with good strength and stiffness. because of their annual renewability and biodegradability, natural fibers have materialized as environmentally-friendly alternatives to synthetic fibers in the last two decades. they are replacing synthetic materials in some traditional composites in industrial manufacturing sectors such as automotive, construction, furniture, and other consumer goods. in this work, the use of lignocellulosic fibers in green materials engineering, particularly their application as polymeric composite reinforcement and surface treatment via ionizing radiation are reviewed. because these cellulose-based materials are intrinsically hydrophilic, they require surface modification to improve their affinity for hydrophobic polymeric matrices, which enhances the strength, durability, and service lifetime of the resulting lignocellulosic fiber-polymer composites. in spite of a long history of using chemical methods in the modification of material surfaces, including the surface of lignocellulosic fibers, recent research leans instead towards application of ionizing radiation. ionizing radiation methods are considered superior to chemical methods, as they are viewed as clean, energy saving, and environmentally friendly. recent applications of controlled ionizing radiation doses in the formulation of natural fiber -reinforced polymeric composites resulted in products with enhanced fiber-polymer interfacial bonding without affecting the inner structure of lignocellulosic fibers. these applications are critically reviewed in this contribution.
immunology	despite the clear need, progress toward a vaccine for congenital cytomegalovirus (cmv) has been slow. however, recent events have provided new interest, and several vaccine candidates are either in clinical trials or the trials are close to starting. in this issue of clinical and vaccine immunology, schleiss and colleagues show that a nonreplicating lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rlcmv)-vectored vaccine expressing cmv glycoprotein b (gb) and/or pp65 induces b and t cells and improves pup survival in a guinea pig model of congenital cmv infection (clin vaccine immunol 24: e00300-16, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00300-16). the combination vaccine appeared to be the most effective.
southern_blotting	a specific and sensitive conventional and real-time pcr assays were developed for the detection and quantification of rhizoctonia solani populations infecting pulses. five different sets of r. solani specific molecular primers arsf1&r1, arsf2&r2 and arsf3&r3, arsf4&r4 and arsf5&r5 were designed from the internal transcribed spacer sequences of r. solani isolates associated with pulse crops representing 7 anastomosis groups (ag1, ag2-2, ag2-2lp, ag2-3, ag3, ag4 and ag5). the designed primers yielded variable amplicons ranging from 174 to 563 bp specific to r. solani populations. the markers proved to be highly sensitive to r. solani and were able to detect the pathogen from both mycelium and infected mung bean plants at various concentrations of genomic dna ranging from 0.025 to 1.0 ng using conventional pcr. the markers were also found suitable for real-time pcr assay with enhanced sensitivity up to 1.24 pg genomic dna. the efficacy of markers for early detection of r. solani infection in mung bean plants was also tested and the marker arsf4&r4 was the most sensitive in detecting the pathogen at 24 h after artificial inoculation under field and at 6 h after artificial inoculation under in vitro conditions. the radioactive and fluorescein amidite labelled probes for markers arsf4&r4 and arsf5&r5 were designed and tested for cross-reactivity and sensitivity by southern blotting and real-time pcr analyses, respectively. both probes proved to be highly sensitive and specific only to r. solani. both quantitative pcr and probe-based diagnostics have been developed for r. solani detection in pulses.
internal_combustion_engine	as oil crisis and environment pollution problem become increasingly prominent, gaseous fuel internal combustion engines (gas engines) have been valued more and more because of the great resources potential and the feature of low pollution of gaseous fuel. however, their average efficiency is just about 30-40% wasting large amount of energy by exhaust, cooling water and so on. therefore, it is an effective way of improving the efficiency to recover waste heat. both the rc (steam rankine cycle) and the orc (organic rankine cycle) are considered as quite suitable methods of whr (waste heat recovery), especially for large engines. as the whr system for a specific large gas engine, rc and orc both have advantages and disadvantages. a gas engine of rated power 1000 kw is the studied object in this paper. according to the characters of its waste heat, the whr systems of rc and orc with different working fluids, including a two-stage organic rankine cycle (dorc) are built in math model and they are compared from the aspects of recovered power, thermal efficiency, system feasibility and so on, which provides a reference for the engineering application. finally, the economic performance of orc, rc and dorc are evaluated and compared.

immunology	background: anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency of which reliable epidemiological data are lacking. this study aimed to analyze how quickly patients presenting with anaphylaxis were treated in emergency and whether treatment followed the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology (eaaci) guidelines. methods: patient data were collected between april 2009 and april 2013. emergency doctors completed a questionnaire for adult patients presenting at the emergency department (ed) of the st. pierre hospital in brussels with anaphylaxis. inclusion criteria were based on the sampson criteria of anaphylaxis. data were analyzed using a microsoft excel database. results: about 0.04% (100/230878) of all emergency visits in adults presented with anaphylaxis. 64% of patients received their first medical help later than 30 min after symptom onset. 67% of patients received adrenaline, 85% oral antihistamines, and 89% received iv glucocorticosteroids. 46/100 patients were discharged directly from the ed, of which 87% received further medical prescriptions for self-administration: 67% corticosteroids, 83% antihistamines, and 9% intramuscular adrenaline. 74% were instructed to consult an allergologist for adequate diagnosis. 54/100 patients were hospitalized. conclusion: the majority of patients were treated according to the eaaci guidelines for management of anaphylaxis, but only a minority received the recommended adrenaline auto-injector for self-administration at discharge. because the majority of patients received medical help later than 30 min after symptom onset, adrenaline auto-injector prescription is a necessity. the low rate of doctors prescribing adrenaline auto-injectors in the ed setting underlines the need to train doctors of various backgrounds in prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis and the close collaboration with allergologists.
molecular_biology	therapeutic interventions for advanced prostate cancer (pca) center on inhibiting androgen receptor (ar) and downstream signaling pathways. resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and/or ar antagonists is inevitable and molecular mechanisms driving castration-resistant pca (cr-pca) primarily involve alterations in ar expression and activity. detailed molecular biology work over the past decade, discussed at length in this review article, has revealed several ar transcripts that result from alternative splicing. these ar splice variants are increased in cell and mouse models of cr-pca and in cr-pca tumors. several ar variants lack the ligand binding domain, but retain their ability to bind dna and activate transcription-linking constitutive ar function and therapeutic failure. arv7 is the only variant endogenously detected at the protein level and thus has undergone more thorough molecular characterization. clinical trials in pca are currently investigating arv7 utility as a biomarker and new therapeutics that inhibit arv7. overall, this review will illustrate the historical perspectives of ar splice variant discovery using fundamental molecular biology techniques and how it changed the clinical approach to both therapeutic decisions and strategy. the body of work investigating ar splice variants in pca represents a true example of translational research from bench to bedside.
southern_blotting	transgenic animal have extensive perspective of research and application in field of medicine, life science and biopharmacy. for this reason, scientists have been explored a more convenient and easy, economic and practical, and high-performance transgenic methods. intratesticular injection as a method to transfer foreign gene into sperm can avoid inhibitory factor and complicated dealing of sperm, ensuring fertilization and embryo development. recombinant efficient expression was made from pires2-egfp plasmid backbone by inserting antimicrobial peptide -thanatin sequence constructed into the mcs region. then the linear vector was injected into the testis of the bailai-hang chicken by surgical operation. 268 s were collected, 257 of them were transgenic chicken embryos. pcr and southern blotting results revealed that 160 of them were positive transgenic chicken embryos, and transgenic rate was 59.70%. southern blotting results showed that the foreign gene was integrated in chicken chromosomes with multi-inserted repeat sequences.
computer-aided_design	plant three-dimensional (3d) computer-aided design (cad) models typically consist of logical configuration, equipment specifications and ports, and 3d shapes. because 3d cad models are used as master information throughout a plant 's entire lifecycle and many stakeholders are involved in such lifecycle, providing a method for sharing plant 3d cad models among various stakeholders is very important. standard 15926 from the international organization for standardization (iso 15926) is a family of standards that is intended to support the sharing and integrating of all information during the life of a process plant. therefore it is important for iso 15926 to support plant 3d cad models. in order to address this issue, this study investigates a standardized method to exchange plant 3d cad models using iso 15926. information requirements regarding plant 3d cad models are established, and then iso 15926 reference data (classes, attributes, and templates) are extended to cover information requirements. for demonstration of the proposed method, we developed a prototype platform where plant 3d cad models in iso 15926 are loaded and retrieved.

hydraulics	in this study, non-darcian flow to a partially penetrating pumping well in a leaky aquifer was investigated. the aquifer system is composed of a main aquifer with an aquitard bounded on the top of the aquifer. the storage of the aquitard was considered in this study, which is the main contribution of this study. the horizontal flow in the main aquifer is assumed to be non-darcian, while both the vertical flows in the main aquifer and the aquitard were assumed to be darcian due to the relative low velocities. the non-darcian flow was described by the izbash equation. a linearization procedure associated with laplace transform and separate variable method were used to solve the non-darcian flow model. semianalytical solutions (laplace-domain solutions) were obtained then inverted to time domain by using the stehfest method. the results indicated that the power index n in the izbash equation results in a smaller drawdown at late times, the flow approaches quasi steady state earlier, and the leakage has little impact on the drawdowns in the main aquifer when n is larger. the drawdowns are quite different from each other for different z positions even at the same radial distance. the sensitivity analysis indicated that the drawdown in the main aquifer is very sensitive to the power index n, moderately sensitive to the parameters of the main aquifer, and relatively not sensitive to the parameters of the aquitard.

northern_blotting	mirnas have emerged as key regulators of gene expression in both plants and animals. these small (generally 21-22 nt) rna molecules, originated from primary ""hairpin"" transcripts, can induce translational suppression or direct mrna cleavage. similar to regular mrnas, the expression of mirnas is highly regulated. their expression pattern could provide critical clues to understanding mirna functions. however, man), previously identified mirna families have multiple paralogous loci. within each family, different members are often closely related and sometimes give rise to identical mirnas. this poses critical challenges in the analysis of individual mirna genes. this chapter describes several methods that are commonly used for mirna expression analysis, including high-throughput sequencing, microarrays, and briefly discusses qrt-pcr, northern blotting, and other approaches used for data validation.
northern_blotting	bsmv (barley stripe mosaic virus) particles were obtained in a pure state from infected host plant tissues of hordeum vulgare. the three genomic parities (alpha, beta and gamma) were amplified by pcr using specific primers for each particle; each was cloned. partial sequence of the alpha, beta and gamma segments was determined for the egyptian isolate of barley stripe mosaic virus (bsmv ae1). alignment of nucleotide sequences with that of other known strains of the virus, bsmv type strains (cv17, nd18 and china), and the generation of phylogenetic trees was performed. a low level of homology was detected comparing 467 bp of the alpha and 643 bp of the segments to that of the other strains, and thus bsmv alpha and beta segments were in separate clusters. however, 1154 bp of the gamma segments of bsmv ae1 showed a high level of homology especially to strain bsmv nd18, as they both formed a distinct cluster. northern blotting of pure bsmv ae1 virus and h. vulgare-infected tissue were compared using an alpha nd18 specific probe. western blotting using antibodies specific for the coat protein (cp) and the triple gene block 1. (tgb1) protein, which are both encoded by the beta nd18 segment, still indicated a high level of similarity between proteins produced by bsmv nd18 and ael we suggest that the bsmv ae1 isolate is a distinct strain of bsmv which reflects the genetic evolutionary divergence among bsmv strains and members of the hordeivirus group.
cell_biology	two articles recently published in nature and nature cell biology reported that early human embryos were successfully cultured beyond blastulation. this development heralds an important step toward exploring the unknown molecular events driving human pregastrulation development, but it inevitably raises the ante in the decades-old ethical debate on how to define early human life and how to save human lives through research without destroying another life in the process. copyright (c) 2016, chongqing medical university. production and hosting by elsevier b.v.
northern_blotting	mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascades are signalling modules that transduce extracellular signalling to a range of cellular responses. plant mapk cascades have been implicated in development and stress response. in this study, we isolated a novel group c mapkk gene, zmmkk4, from maize. northern blotting analysis revealed that the zmmkk4 transcript expression was up-regulated by cold, high salt and exogenous h(2)o(2), but down-regulated by exogenous abscisic acid (aba). over-expression of zmmkk4 in arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold and salt stresses by increased germination rate, lateral root numbers, plant survival rate, chlorophyll, proline and soluble sugar contents, and antioxidant enzyme [peroxidase (pod), catalase (cat)] activities compared with control plants. furthermore, zmmkk4 enhanced a 37 kda kinase activity after cold and salt stresses. rt-pcr analysis revealed that the transcript levels of stress-responsive transcription factors and functional genes were higher in zmmkk4-over-expressing plants than in control plants. in addition, zmmkk4 protein is localized in the nucleus. taken together, these results indicate that zmmkk4 is a positive regulator of salt and cold tolerance in plants.
immunology	cellular metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of adaptive immunity. while the metabolic requirements of conventional t cells are increasingly understood, the role of cellular metabolism in foxp3(+) regulatory t (treg) cells is less clear. although it is well accepted that repression of akt/mtor, hif-1 alpha and aerobic glycolysis are important for the efficient generation of treg cells in vitro, clear evidence how these pathways impact on treg-cell development in vivo is limited. furthermore, newer studies have shown that the same pathways that appear to suppress treg-cell development are active in and required for functionally mature treg cells. thus, it becomes increasingly evident that development and function of regulatory t cells require different wiring of metabolic pathways. finally, it is likely that critical differences remain to be uncovered between the metabolism of resting or 'naive' treg cells and those fully differentiated and actively engaged in suppression. in this comment, we briefly discuss our current understanding of treg-cell metabolism and the need to address this area with new approaches based on in vivo models.
southern_blotting	low temperature plays a crucial role in seasonal development of woody plants and may directly impact crop production, more particularly in temperate fruit trees. given its high genetic variability and adaptability to different climatic conditions, almond (prunus dulcis mill.) is an interesting model to understand the mechanisms regulating low temperature sensing in fruit trees. in this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of two genes (pdcbf1 and pdcbf2) belonging to the c-repeat-binding factor (cbf) family of transcription factors. southern blotting analysis showed that this family is composed of at least five members. in almond shoots propagated in vitro, transcription of these genes was rapidly induced by low temperature, suggesting an involvement in cold acclimation. transactivation assays showed that pdcbf1 and pdcbf2 could bind to dehydration responsive element/c-repeat containing sequences, as activators of gene expression. in addition, induction of both pdcbfs by cold was higher towards the end of the day, which agreed with the expression pattern of pddehydrin1, a predicted cbf target gene. furthermore, pdcbf1 and pdcbf2 were also transiently induced by abscisic acid and drought treatments. considering the bin mapping analysis that correlated pdcbfs and pddhn1 (respectively in linkage groups 5 and 7) with two different quantitative trait locicontrolling blooming time, it is relevant to perform further association studies that may validate their effect on this trait.
fluid_mechanics	needle valve response to input signal is controlled apart from the dynamics of the driving mechanical actuator - by interaction of fluidic and mechanic aspects. despite the long history and ubiquitous use of needle valves, their aerodynamics has never been really systematically investigated. recent uses for extreme conditions, such as those in the new field of additive manufacturing, put great relevance on accumulating aerodynamic research data. this third part of a trilogy presents results of pressure measurements on internal walls in configurations characterised by rounded needle tip and/or entrance into the exit channel.

polymerase_chain_reaction	improvement of cultivar resistance is the key strategy to control the host-specialized pathogen verticillium longisporum in oilseed rape (osr). a special feature of this pathogen is its systemic, non-homogenous and delayed colonization of the plant xylem resulting in an extended symptomless period of latency. as a result, severity of infection in the field is difficult to score as it becomes apparent only at crop maturity stages when it may be confused with natural senescence. assessment of verticillium disease severity in osr by visual scoring of microsclerotia on harvested stubbles unsatisfactorily reflects genotypic resistance as it is strongly affected by the ripening stage of the plant. to overcome these limitations, we developed a qpcr method, which unambiguously differentiates levels of quantitative resistance to v. longisporum in osr genotypes under field conditions. the specificity and sensitivity of two primer pairs targeting its or tubulin loci in the v. longisporum genome were tested. while tubulin primers showed a high specificity to v. longisporum isolates, its primers exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity in detecting fungal dna in stem tissue (limit of quantification =0.56 fg dna) of field-grown pre-symptomatic plants. the best discrimination of resistant and susceptible osr cultivars based on fungal dna analysis in stem tissue was achieved at growth stage 80, at the transition of fungal vascular growth in viable plants to saprotrophic colonization of senescent stem tissues. field screening data obtained with qpcr at growth stage 80 confirmed results from greenhouse testing thus corroborating the relevance and reliability of seedling assays for determining cultivar responses to v. longisporum in the field, as a useful tool for breeders in first selection of elite osr genotypes with improved resistance to verticillium.
enzymology	background/aims: to investigate the feasibility and mechanism of liver damage repair using bmscs, we investigated the potential for bmscs in recovery from liver damage, using the ccl4-induced rat model for liver damage. methodology: phenotypings of bmscs of the third generation were analyzed by flow cytometry. bmscs labelled by brdu were infused via the tail vein of ccl4-induced rat model. the labeling yields observed were detected by flow cytometry and liver samples were taken for immunohistochemistry. concentration changes of ast, alt and akp were observed by a serum enzymology test after transplantation. results: the brdu(+) cells in recipient livers were detected on day 7 after bmscs transplantation and engrafted cells were found in the pen-portal regions of the hepatic lobule and on day 14 more of them spread throughout the lobules. bmscs engraftments were detected on whole hepatic parenchyma. the serum levels of alt, ast and akp in group 3 were all lower than those of group 2 from the 7th to 28th day. conclusions: ex vivo-expanded bmscs were capable of relocating to the chemically-injured liver. transplantation of these pluripotent stem cells appeared to improve serum indices of liver function.
thermodynamics	a parametric investigation of radiative heat transfer is carried out, including the effects of conjugate heat transfer between fluid and solid media. the thermal radiation is simulated using the p-1-model. the numerical model and the thermal coupling strategy, suitable for a transient solver, is described. such numerical coupling requires that the radiative equation is solved several times at each iteration; hence, the computational cost of the radiative model is a crucial issue. the p-1-model is adopted because of its particularly fast computation. first, a collection of benchmark cases is presented and used to carefully validate the radiation model against literature results and to analyse the model prediction limits. despite the simplicity of the model, it satisfactorily reproduces the thermal radiation effects. some lack of accuracy is identified in particular cases. second, a number of benchmark cases are described and adopted to investigate fluid-solid thermal interaction in the presence of radiation. three cases are designed, to couple radiation with: pure conduction, conduction and forced convection, conduction and natural convection. in all the cases, the surface radiative heat transfer strongly influences the system thermodynamics, leading to a significant increase of the fluid-solid interface temperature. the main non dimensional numbers, related to the mutual influence of the different heat transfer modes, are introduced and employed in the analyses. a new conduction-radiation parameter is derived in order to study the conductive boundary layer in absence of convective heat transfer.

enzymology	now that the centennial anniversary of the first report on pressure denaturation of proteins by nobel laureate p. w. bridgman can be celebrated, this review on the application of high pressure as a key variable for studying the energetics and interactions of proteins appears. we demonstrate that combined temperature-pressure-dependent studies help delineate the free-energy landscape of proteins and elucidate which features are essential in determining their stability. pressure perturbation also serves as an important tool to explore fluctuations in proteins and reveal their conformational substates. from shaping the free-energy landscape of proteins themselves to that of their interactions, conformational fluctuations not only dictate a plethora of biological processes, but are also implicated in a number of debilitating diseases. finally, the advantages of using pressure to explore biomolecular assemblies and modulate enzymatic reactions are discussed.
northern_blotting	since their discovery about 20 years ago, small rnas have been shown to play a critical role in a myriad of biological processes. the greater availability of high-throughput sequencing has been invaluable to furthering our understanding of small rnas as regulatory molecules. in particular, these sequencing technologies have been crucial in understanding the role of small rnas in reproductive tissues, where millions of individual sequences are generated. in this context, high-throughput sequencing provides the requisite level of resolution that other procedures, like northern blotting, would not be able to achieve. here, we describe a protocol for the preparation of small rna libraries for sequencing using the solexa/illumina technology.
southern_blotting	borrelia burgdorferisensu lato infection has been confirmed in clinical cases in the northeast of mexico; however, the bacterium has not been identified as infecting the tick vector ixodes, amblyomma and dermacentor ticks were collected from mammals and plants in northeastern mexico and examined for borrelia. eighteen of 214 ticks were pcr-positive for the fla and 16s rrna genes and 15 for the ospa gene. southern blotting with a fla probe and sequencing of ospa genes confirmed infection with b. burgdorferi sensu stricto. these findings, together with reports of indigenous cases, fulfil the criteria that allow northeastern mexico to be considered as a zone endemic for lyme disease.
enzymology	seven z-octadecenoic acids having the double bond located in positions 6z to 13z were photooxidized. the resulting hydroperoxy-e-octadecenoic acids [hpome(e)] were resolved by chiral phase-hplc-ms, and the absolute configurations of the enantiomers were determined by gas chromatographic analysis of diastereoisomeric derivatives. the ms/ms/ms spectra showed characteristic fragments, which were influenced by the distance between the hydroperoxide and carboxyl groups. these fatty acids were then investigated as substrates of cyclooxygenase-1 (cox-1), manganese lipoxygenase (mnlox), and the (8r)-dioxygenase (8r-dox) activities of two linoleate diol synthases (lds) and 10r-dox. cox-1 and mnlox abstracted hydrogen at c-11 of (12z)-18:1 and c-12 of (13z)-18:1. (11z)-18:1 was subject to hydrogen abstraction at c-10 by mnlox and at both allylic positions by cox-1. both allylic hydrogens of (8z)-18:1 were also abstracted by 8r-dox activities of lds and 10r-dox, but only the allylic hydrogens close to the carboxyl groups of (11z)-18:1 and (12z)-18:1. 8r-dox also oxidized monoenoic c-14-c-20 fatty acids with double bonds at the (9z) position, suggesting that the length of the omega end has little influence on positioning for oxygenation. we conclude that cox-1 and mnlox can readily abstract allylic hydrogens of octadecenoic fatty acids from c-10 to c-12 and 8r-dox from c-7 and c-12.-oliw, e. h., a. wennman, i. hoffmann, u. garscha, m. hamberg, and f. jerneren. stereoselective oxidation of regioisomeric octadecenoic acids by fatty acid dioxygenases. j. lipid res. 2011. 52: 1995-2004.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aimsthe aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a real-time pcr technology for microbiological control methods to examine individualized cell therapeutics, an emerging class of pharmaceutical formulations. methods and resultsoligonucleotide primers and hybridization probe for bacterial detection targeting the 16srrna gene were adapted based on nadkarni etal. [microbiology148 (2002) 257]. for detection of yeast and moulds, primers and probe were designed from conserved sequences of the 18srrna gene in this study. the real-time pcr assays were tested on genomic dna of escherichia coli and candida albicans to assess efficiency and linear dynamic range. after successful establishment of robust real-time pcrs, applicability of the assays was evaluated by extracting microbial target dna from cell-based preparations. different commercial dna extraction methods were compared identifying the magna pure dna isolation kit iii as the method of choice. sensitivity was examined for different strains and a detection limit of 10(2)-10(3) cfu per ml in a sample containing similar to 10(6) mammalian cells per ml was achieved. conclusionsthis study reports the successful establishment of two qualitative real-time pcr assays, enabling in general the broad-range detection of microbial contaminants in a cell-based sample matrix. significance and impact of the studyindividualized cell therapeutics tend to have a short shelf life. due to lengthy incubation periods, compendial testing according to current pharmacopoeial guidelines may not be applicable. we report a suitable alternative method upon which future microbiological quality control methods for such products could be based on. however, to implement valid rapid microbiological testing methods using real-time pcr technology, further challenges need to be addressed.
northern_blotting	rearing in darkness slows the time course of the visual cortical critical period, such that at 5 weeks of age normal cats are more plastic than dark-reared cats, while at 20 weeks dark-reared cats are more plastic [mower gd (1991) the effect of dark rearing on the time course of the critical period in cat visual cortex. dev brain res 58:151-158]. thus, genes that are important for visual cortical plasticity should show differences in expression between normal and darkreared visual cortex that are of opposite direction in young versus older animals. previously, we showed by differential display polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting that mrna for munc13-3, a mammalian homologue of the c. elegans uncoordinated (unc) gene, shows such bidirectional regulation in cat visual cortex [yang cb, zheng yt, li gy, mower gd (2002) identification of munc13-3 as a candidate gene for critical period neuroplasticity in visual cortex. j neurosci 22:8614-8618]. here, the analysis is extended to munc13-3protein in mouse visual cortex, which will provide the basis for gene manipulation analysis. in mice, munc13-3 protein was elevated 2.3-fold in dark-reared compared with normal visual cortex at 3.5 weeks and 2.0-fold in normal compared with dark-reared visual cortex at 9.5 weeks. analysis of variance of protein levels showed a significant interaction, indicating that the effect of dark rearing depended on age. this bidirectional regulation was restricted to visual cortex and did not occur in frontal cortex. bidirectional regulation was also specific to munc13-3 and was not found for other munc13 family members. munc13 proteins serve a central priming function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis at glutamatergic and gabaergic synapses and this work contributes to the growing evidence indicating a role of munc13 genes in synaptic plasticity.

human_metabolism	the jet machine and associated facilities require significant maintenance and enhancement installation activities in support of the experimental exploitation programme. a proportion of these activities are within radiological and respiratory hazardous environments. as such, breathing air-fed one-piece pressurised suits provide workers with protection from the inhalation of both airborne tritium and beryllium dust. the design of these suits has essentially developed empirically. there is a practical necessity to improve the design to optimise worker performance, protection and thermal comfort. this paper details the complexity of modeling the three-dimensional thermofluid domain between the inner surface of the suit and under garments that includes mass as well as heat transfer, suiting geometry, human metabolism and respiration and effects of limb movements. the methods used include computational fluid dynamics (cfd), theoretical adaptations of mixed-phase turbulent now, profile scanning of a suit and actuating life size mannequin and data processing of the images and experimental validation trials. the achievements of the current programme and collaborations are presented in the paper and future endeavors are discussed.

molecular_biology	rice stripe virus (rsv) is an insect-borne tenuivirus of economical significance. it is endemic to the rice growing regions of east asia and exhibits more genetic diversity in yunnan province of china. to gain more insights into the molecular epidemiology and evolution of rsv, recombination analyses were conducted and potential events were detected in each of the four rna segments of rsv. bayesian coalescent method was then applied to the time-stamped coding sequences of the cp gene. the nucleotide substitution rate and the divergence time were estimated. age calculations suggested that the first diversification event of the rsv isolates analyzed might take place in the early 20th century, and rsv has existed in yunnan long before notice. surveys of codon usage variation showed that the rsv genes had influences other than mutational bias. in codon choice, rsv conformed to neither vector small brown planthopper nor host rice, although the former exerted a more dominant influence on shaping codon usage pattern of rsv. in addition, cpg dinucleotide deficiency was observed in rsv.

genetics	background: microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancers (crc) that are due to deficient dna mismatch repair (dmmr) represent approximately 15% of all crcs in the united states. these microsatellite-unstable crcs represent a heterogenous group of diseases with distinct oncogenesis pathways. there are overlapping clinicopathologic features between some of these groups, but many important differences are present. therefore, determination of the etiology for the dmmr is vital for proper patient management and follow-up. main body: epigenetic inactivation of mlh1 mmr gene (sporadic microsatellite-unstable crc) and germline mutation in an mmr gene (lynch syndrome, ls) are the two most common mechanisms in the pathogenesis of microsatellite instability in crc. however, in a subset of dmmr crc cases that are identified by screening tests, no known ls-associated genetic alterations are appreciated by current genetic analysis. when the etiology for dmmr is unclear, it leads to patient anxiety and creates challenges for clinical management. conclusion: it is critical to distinguish ls patients from other patients with tumors due to dmmr, so that the proper screening protocol can be employed for the patients and their families, with the goal to save lives while avoiding unnecessary anxiety and costs. this review summarizes the major pathogenesis pathways of dmmr crcs, their clinicopathologic features, and practical screening suggestions. in addition, we include frequently asked questions for mmr immunohistochemistry interpretation.
northern_blotting	a full-length beet black scorch virus (bbsv) cdna clone (pubf52) was constructed by rt-pcr. the clone contains an upstream t7 rna polymerase promoter designed for in vitro transcription of infectious rnas from the linearized plasmid that faithfully represent the viral cdna. leaves of chenopodium amaranticolor inoculated with in vitro transcripts developed the same symptoms and disease phenotype as the wild type virus. the presence of bbsv rna and coat protein in the leaves was confirmed respectively by northern blotting and western blotting. comparisons of specific immunoreactions between the expression product of the bbsv p24 gene in e. coli and antiserum against purified bbsv virions demonstrated that the p24 gene encodes the coat protein. based on the sequence of the pubf52 cdna, a frame-shift mutant and two deletion mutants were generated. one of the deletions encompasses the entire cp orf and the other truncates 174 amino acids from the central region of the protein. transcripts derived from the frame-shift cp mutant, which terminates the cp after the first 23 amino acids, elicited the same symptom phenotype and levels of rna accumulation as the wild type virus, but the leaves infected with the cp deletion mutants exhibited greatly reduced rna accumulation. in addition, leaves inoculated with in vitro transcripts of the mutant in which the entire cp gene was deleted had lower local lesions than wild type virus transcripts. two expression vectors, pbgfp and pbgus, were constructed by fusing the gfp and gus genes to the 23 n-terminal amino acids of the cp gene, respectively. leaves infected with in vitro transcripts of pbgfp and pbgus exhibited expression of gfp and gus proteins as assessed by laser confocal microscopy and histochemical staining, respectively. the high levels of expression of the gfp and gus proteins provide tools that can be used for studies of replication and movement of the virus, and indicate that bbsv has considerable biotechnology potential as a plant virus expression vehicle.
immunology	neutrophil extracellular traps are networks of dna, histones and neutrophil proteins released in response to infectious and inflammatory stimuli. although a component of the innate immune response, nets are implicated in a range of disease processes including autoimmunity and thrombosis. this protocol describes a simple method for canine neutrophil isolation and quantification of nets using a microplate fluorescence assay. blood is collected using conventional venipuncture techniques. neutrophils are isolated using dextran sedimentation and a density gradient using conditions optimized for dog blood. after allowing time for attachment to the wells of a 96 well plate, neutrophils are treated with net-inducing agonists such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate or platelet activating factor. dna release is measured by the fluorescence of a cell-impermeable nucleic acid dye. this assay is a simple, inexpensive method for quantifying net release, but net formation rather than other causes of cell death must be confirmed with alternative methods.
cell_biology	recent advances in the field of immunometabolism support the concept that fundamental processes in t cell biology, such as tcr-mediated activation and t helper lineage differentiation, are closely linked to changes in the cellular metabolic programs. although the major task of the intermediate metabolism is to provide the cell with a constant supply of energy and molecular precursors for the production of biomolecules, the dynamic regulation of metabolic pathways also plays an active role in shaping t cell responses. key metabolic processes such as glycolysis, fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolism are now recognized as crucial players in t cell activation and differentiation, and their modulation can differentially affect the development of t helper cell lineages. in this review, we describe the diverse metabolic processes that t cells engage during their life cycle from nave towards effector and memory t cells. we consider in particular how the cellular metabolism may actively support the function of t cells in their different states. moreover, we discuss how molecular regulators such as mtor or ampk link environmental changes to adaptations in the cellular metabolism and elucidate the consequences on t cell differentiation and function.

polymerase_chain_reaction	chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p), are used in grasslands to maximize plant biomass production for livestock. despite a substantial body of work on how fertilization affects aboveground plant and belowground microbial communities, the short-term response of soil ammonia oxidizing microbial communities, which play the central role in nitrification, to fertilization is not well understood. the responses of ammonia-oxidizing microbial communities to short-term (3 years) n and/or p additions were investigated in an alpine grassland of the qinghai-tibetan plateau. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) analysis of the amoa genes showed that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (aoa) dominated over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (aob) in non-amended soil. short-term urea addition significantly increased the abundance of aob, whereas aoa abundance remained unchanged, resulting in a shift from aoa to aob dominance, which suggests that aob are likely to be more important in the first step of the nitrification following urea amendment. pyrosequencing demonstrated a significant shift in aob but not aoa community composition within short-term n fertilizer plots, indicating that aob community composition was more sensitive than aoa in response to urea amendment. this study demonstrated that the abundance and composition of aoa and aob communities responded differently to 3 years of urea addition, suggesting that n fertilizer may be an important controller of ammonia oxidizing microbial communities in managed alpine grasslands, such as those of the qinghai-tibet plateau.
molecular_biology	oscillators are essential to fuel autonomous behaviours in molecular systems. artificial oscillators built with programmable biological molecules such as dna and rna are generally easy to build and tune, and can serve as timers for biological computation and regulation. we describe a new artificial nucleic acid biochemical reaction network, and we demonstrate its capacity to exhibit oscillatory solutions. this network can be built in vitro using nucleic acids and three bacteriophage enzymes, and has the potential to be implemented in cells. numerical simulations suggest that oscillations occur in a realistic range of reaction rates and concentrations.
computer-aided_design	objective: no clinical data are available for the new computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (cad/cam) material zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (zls) ceramic. this study describes preliminary clinical results for indirect zls cad/cam restorations after 12 months. method and materials: indirect restorations were fabricated, using the cerec method and intraoral scanning (cerec omnicam, cerec mcxl). sixty-seven restorations were seated adhesively (baseline). sixty restorations were evaluated after 12 months (follow-up), using modified fdi criteria. two groups were established, according to zls restorations' post-processing procedure prior to adhesive seating: group i (three-step polishing, n = 32) and group ii (fire glazing, n = 28). statistical ana-lysis was performed with mann-whitney u test and wilcoxon test (p.05). statistically significant differences were found for criteria surface gloss for group i and group ii (mann-whitney u test, p <.05). conclusion: this study demonstrates zls cad/cam restorations have a high clinical success rate after 12 months. a longer clinical evaluation period is necessary to draw further conclusions.
computer-aided_design	task-based language learning (tbll) has heavily influenced syllabus design, classroom teaching, and learner assessment in a foreign or second language teaching context. in this english as foreign language (efl) learning environment, the paper discussed an innovative language learning pedagogy based on design education and technical writing. in this tbll course, the language learning based assignments centered on designing and analyzing objects using various computer-aided design software and physical lego toolkit. the design software was used collaboratively and the design analysis was done mostly as group activities. the language production activities centered on technical document authoring, using collaborative online authoring tools for website hosting and note-taking for design projects, besides oral in-class presentations, and online posting in english. language reception activities such as readings related to the course lectures, videos, assignment, and assessment instructions were hosted and linked from moodlethe learning management system. this paper critically analyzed student performance with physical lego design and cad software, including how student groups authored websites detailing the structural and functional specifications related to the product assembly procedure. this paper outlined how design pedagogy could be included in the curriculum while teaching english as a foreign language. in the process, students not only learnt about design fundamentals, but how to author complex technical documents in english. findings based on course data and class interactions have adequately demonstrated that students were capable of handling the task-based language projects with reasonable efficiency and confidence.
thermodynamics	cancer cells are the site of numerous metabolic and thermodynamic abnormalities. we focus this review on the interactions between the canonical wnt/beta-catenin pathway and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar gamma) in cancers and their implications from an energetic and metabolic point of view. in numerous tissues, ppar gamma activation induces inhibition of beta-catenin pathway, while the activation of the canonical wnt/ beta-catenin pathway inactivates ppar gamma. in most cancers but not all, ppar gamma is downregulated while the wnt/beta-catenin pathway is upregulated. in cancer cells, upregulation of the wnt/beta-catenin signaling induces dramatic changes in key metabolic enzymes that modify their thermodynamic behavior. this leads to activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (pdk-1) and monocarboxylate lactate transporter. consequently, phosphorylation of pdk-1 inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdh). thus, a large part of pyruvate cannot be converted into acetyl-coenzyme a (acetyl-coa) in mitochondria and only a part of acetyl-coa can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. this leads to aerobic glycolysis in spite of the availability of oxygen. this phenomenon is referred to as the warburg effect. cytoplasmic pyruvate is converted into lactate. the wnt/beta-catenin pathway induces the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, i.e., myc and cyclin d1. this ultimately promotes the nucleotide, protein and lipid synthesis necessary for cell growth and multiplication. in cancer, activation of the pi3k-akt pathway induces an increase of the aerobic glycolysis. moreover, prostaglandin e2 by activating the canonical wnt pathway plays also a role in cancer. in addition in many cancer cells, ppar gamma is downregulated. moreover, ppar gamma contributes to regulate some key circadian genes. in cancers, abnormalities in the regulation of circadian rhythms (crs) are observed. crs are dissipative structures which play a key-role in far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. in cancers, metabolism, thermodynamics and crs are intimately interrelated.
strength_of_materials	porous magnesium-based materials are biodegradable and promising for use in orthopaedic applications, but their applications are hampered by their difficult fabrication. this work reports the preparation of porous magnesium materials by a powder metallurgy technique using ammonium bicarbonate as spacer particles. the porosity of the materials depended on the amount of ammonium bicarbonate and was found to have strong negative effects on flexural strength and corrosion behaviour. however, the flexural strength of materials with porosities of up to 28 vol.% was higher than the flexural strength of non-metallic biomaterials and comparable with that of natural bone.

fluid_mechanics	water and other liquids can cause production problems for natural gas wells. an established but labour-intensive method for removing these liquids is the use of absorbent foam sticks, which are lowered into the wells and then lifted back up again. this paper presents an automated solution for launching foam sticks down gas wells and recovering them - and without the need for a grid electricity supply. the foam-stick launching apparatus has an enclosed magazine with several chambers. it is controlled by a solar-powered skid-mounted electric-pneumatic control system, which includes a storage battery, time relays, a wireless switch module and a compressed gas supply. a typical water-producing gas well was selected to illustrate the technology. its successful application indicates that engineers can remove liquid from water-producing gas wells and bring them back to production normally using this novel artificial lift technology, which can also be used in remote areas with no electrical supply.
immunology	myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs) are immune suppressive cells that are hallmarks of human cancer. mdscs inhibit cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) and nk cell functions to promote tumor immune escape and progression, and therefore are considered key targets in cancer immunotherapy. recent studies determined a key role of the apoptosis pathways in tumor-induced mdsc homeostasis and it is known that ceramide plays a key role in regulation of mammalian cell apoptosis. in this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy and underlying molecular mechanism of ceramide in suppression of mdscs. treatment of tumor-bearing mice with lcl521, a lysosomotropic inhibitor of acid ceramidase, significantly decreased mdsc accumulation in vivo. using a mdsc-like myeloid cell model, we determined that lcl521 targets lysosomes and increases total cellular c16 ceramide level. although mdsc-like cells have functional apoptosis pathways, lcl521-induced mdsc death occurs in an apoptosis-and necroptosis-independent mechanism. lcl521 treatment resulted in an increase in the number of autophagic vesicles, heterolysosomes and swollen ers. finally, concomitant inhibition of cathepsin b and cathepsin d was required to significantly decrease lcl521-induced cell death. our observations indicate that lcl521 targets lysosomes to activate cathepsin b and cathepsin d, resulting in interrupted autophagy and er stress that culminates in mdsc death. therefore, a ceramidase inhibitor is potentially an effective adjunct therapeutic agent for suppression of mdscs to enhance the efficacy of ctl-based cancer immunotherapy.
genetics	the anticipation of ethical issues that may arise with the clinical use of genomic technologies is crucial to envision their future implementation in a manner sensitive to local contexts. yet, populations in low- and middle-income countries are underrepresented in studies that aim to explore stakeholders' perspectives on the use of such technologies. within the framework of a research project entitled ""personalized medicine in the treatment of epilepsy"", we sought to increase inclusiveness by widening the reach of our survey, inviting neurologists from around the world to share their views and practices regarding the use of whole-genome sequencing in clinical neurology and its associated ethics. we discuss herein the compelling scientific and ethical reasons that led us to attempt to recruit neurologists worldwide, despite the lack, in many low- or middle-income countries, of access to genomic technologies. recruitment procedures and their results are presented and discussed, as well as the barriers we faced. we conclude that inclusive recruitment remains a challenging, albeit necessary and legitimate, endeavour.
cell_biology	duckweed can be used for bioremediation of selenium (se) polluted water because of its capability of absorbing minerals from growing media. however, the presence of se in the media may affect the growth of the duckweed. landoltia punctata 7449 has been studied for its changes in chemical and biological properties with the presence of se in the media. the duckweed was cultivated over a 12-day period at different initial concentrations of selenite (na2seo3) from 0 to 80moll(-1). the growth rate, the organic and total se contents, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the photosynthetic pigment contents, the chlorophyll a fluorescence ojip transient, and the ultrastructure of the duckweed were monitored during the experiment. the results have shown that se at low concentrations of 20moll(-1) promoted the growth of the l.punctata and inhibited lipid peroxidation. substantial increases in duckweed growth rate and organic se content in the duckweed were observed at low se concentrations. the anti-oxidative effect occurred likely with the increases in guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities as well as the amount of photosynthetic pigments. however, negative impact to the duckweed was observed when the l.punctata was exposed to high se concentrations (40moll(-1)), in which the duckweed growth was inhibited by the selenium. the results indicate that l.punctata 7449 can be used for bioremediation of selenium (se) polluted water when the se concentration is 20moll(-1).
human_metabolism	background: selenium is an essential element, but its metabolism in humans is not well characterized. a few small studies indicate that the trimethylselenonium ion (tmse) is a common selenium metabolite in humans. objective: this study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of selenium to tmse. design: study individuals constituted subsamples of 2 cohorts: 1) pregnant women (n = 228) and their 5-y-old children (n = 205) in rural bangladesh with poor selenium status [median urinary selenium (u-se): 6.4 mu g/l in mothers, 14 mu g/l in children] and 2) women in the argentinian andes (n = 83) with adequate selenium status (median u-se: 24 mu g/l). total u-se and blood selenium were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icpms), and urinary concentrations of tmse were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/vapor generation/icpms. a genomewide association study (gwas) was performed for 1,629,299 (after filtration) single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the bangladeshi women (n = 72) by using illumina omni5m, and results were validated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: tmse ""producers"" were prevalent (approximately one-third) among the bangladeshi women and their children, in whom tmse constituted similar to 10-70% of u-se, whereas ""nonproducers"" had, on average, 0.59% tmse. the tmse-producing women had, on average, 2-mu g u-se/l higher concentrations than did the nonproducers. in contrast, only 3 of the 83 andean women were tmse producers (6-15% tmse in the urine); the average percentage among the nonproducers was 0.35%. comparison of the percentage of urinary tmse in mothers and children indicated a strong genetic influence. the gwas identified 3 snps in the indolethylamine n-methyltransferase gene (inmt) that were strongly associated with percentage of tmse (p < 0.001, false-discovery rate corrected) in both cohorts. conclusions: there are remarkable population and individual variations in the formation of tmse, which could largely be explained by snps in inmt. the tmse-producing women had higher u-se concentrations than did nonproducers, but further elucidation of the metabolic pathways of selenium is essential for the understanding of its role in human health.
computer-aided_design	in this paper, 3d printing as a novel printing process was considered for deposition of polymers on synthetic fabrics to introduce more flexible, resource-efficient and cost effective textile functionalization processes than conventional printing process like screen and inkjet printing. the aim is to develop an integrated or tailored production process for smart and functional textiles which avoid unnecessary use of water, energy, chemicals and minimize the waste to improve ecological footprint and productivity. adhesion of polymer and nanocomposite layers which were 3d printed directly onto the textile fabrics using fused deposition modeling (fdm) technique was investigated. different variables which may affect the adhesion properties including 3d printing process parameters, fabric type and filler type incorporated in polymer were considered. a rectangular shape according to the peeling standard was designed as 3d computer-aided design (cad) to find out the effect of the different variables. the polymers were printed in different series of experimental design: nylon on polyamide 66 (pa66) fabrics, polylactic acid (pla) on pa66 fabric, pla on pla fabric, and finally nanosize carbon black/pla (cb/pla) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes/pla (cnt/pla) nanocomposites on pla fabrics. the adhesion forces were quantified using the innovative sample preparing method combining with the peeling standard method. results showed that different variables of 3d printing process like extruder temperature, platform temperature and printing speed can have significant effect on adhesion force of polymers to fabrics while direct 3d printing. a model was proposed specifically for deposition of a commercial 3d printer nylon filament on pa66 fabrics. in the following, among the printed polymers, pla and its composites had high adhesion force to pla fabrics.

fluid_mechanics	the past researches on the gas leakage through the clearance seal were studied mainly by the analytical model or numerical simulations using cfd method based on the classical fluid mechanics theory in the conditions of steady laminar flow, incompressible, constant temperature, constant viscosity, and no relative sliding between the inner and outer wall. however, it is widely known that the cfd theory may not be applicable to the micro-size flow. in this paper, the molecular mechanism of the gas leak through the clearance seal was investigated by md (molecular dynamics) simulations. the johnson potential model was used for fe-fe atomic interactions and the uff (universal force field) potential model was used for the atomic interactions between fe he and he he. the gap thickness was varied from 2000 a to 5000 a. the pressure difference over the ends of the gap was from 0.2 mpa to 1.0 mpa. the simulation results show that the leakage rate was proportional to the pressure difference and the gap thickness. during the process of the leakage, the sticky layers were formed on the gap walls. the number density of the atoms in the sticky layer was much larger than that of the central region. and the density of the gas flow of the leakage was much smaller than that of the gas reservoir. the leakage mechanism was mainly due to the diffusion motions of the atoms through the sticky layers although the moving speed of the sticky layers was very slow. the leakage flow rate from the md simulation was quite consistent with that from the analytical calculation.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the ability to identify and stratify patients that will respond to specific therapies has been transformational in a number of disease areas, particularly oncology. it is anticipated that this will also be the case for cell-based therapies, particularly in complex and heterogeneous diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (ra). recently, clinical results with expanded allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eascs) have indicated clinical efficacy in highly refractory ra patients. in this study, we set out to determine if circulating micrornas (mirnas) could be identified as potential biomarkers associated with response to eascs in these ra patients. the mirna expression profiles of pre-treatment plasma samples from responder and nonresponder patients were determined using microarrays. ten mirnas were identified that were differentially expressed in the responder group as compared to the nonresponder group. to confirm the differential expression of these 10 mirna biomarkers, they were further assayed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). from this analysis, three mirnas, mir-26b-5p, mir-487b-3p and mir-495-3p, were confirmed as being statistically significantly upregulated in the responder group as compared with the nonresponder group. receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed their diagnostic potential. these mirnas could represent novel candidate stratification biomarkers associated with ra patient response to eascs and are worthy of further clinical validation.
computer-aided_design	independently adjustable multielectrode arrays are routinely used to interrogate neuronal circuit function, enabling chronic in vivo monitoring of neuronal ensembles in freely behaving animals at a single-cell, single spike resolution. despite the importance of this approach, its widespread use is limited by highly specialized design and fabrication methods. to address this, we have developed a scalable, lightweight, integrated and quick-to-assemble multielectrode array platform. this platform additionally integrates optical fibers with independently adjustable electrodes to allow simultaneous single unit recordings and circuit-specific optogenetic targeting and/or manipulation. in current designs, the fully assembled platforms are scalable from 2 to 32 microdrives, and yet range 1-3 g, light enough for small animals. here, we describe the design process starting from intent in computer-aided design, parameter testing through finite element analysis and experimental means, and implementation of various applications across mice and rats. combined, our methods may expand the utility of multielectrode recordings and their continued integration with other tools enabling functional dissection of intact neural circuits.
computer-aided_design	background: three-dimensional (3d) printing has numerous applications and has gained much interest in the medical world. the constantly improving quality of 3d-printing applications has contributed to their increased use on patients. this paper summarizes the literature on surgical 3d-printing applications used on patients, with a focus on reported clinical and economic outcomes. methods: three major literature databases were screened for case series (more than three cases described in the same study) and trials of surgical applications of 3d printing in humans. results: 227 surgical papers were analyzed and summarized using an evidence table. the papers described the use of 3d printing for surgical guides, anatomical models, and custom implants. 3d printing is used in multiple surgical domains, such as orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, cranial surgery, and spinal surgery. in general, the advantages of 3d-printed parts are said to include reduced surgical time, improved medical outcome, and decreased radiation exposure. the costs of printing and additional scans generally increase the overall cost of the procedure. conclusion: 3d printing is well integrated in surgical practice and research. applications vary from anatomical models mainly intended for surgical planning to surgical guides and implants. our research suggests that there are several advantages to 3d- printed applications, but that further research is needed to determine whether the increased intervention costs can be balanced with the observable advantages of this new technology. there is a need for a formal cost-effectiveness analysis.
molecular_biology	objective: to provide selectable microrna for intervening diabetes mellitus diseases, nod mice 's expression of microrna in pancreas tissues and blood under the exendin-4 intervention of was observed and the difference of microrna target gene was screened. materials and methods: forty clean nod mice were randomly divided into four groups (in each group, n = 10): one is blank control group d which is intervened with normal saline, and the other three groups were divided into low-dose group a, middle-dose group b, and high-dose group c according to the different exendin- 4 dosage 2, 4, and 8 mu g/kg.d. after the 8-week intervention, these four groups were killed, and the pancreatic tissue and blood were left to prepare specimens for morphology and molecular biology analysis. the specimen with differential expression microrna in pancreas tissue and blood should be screened out after detected with the locked nucleic acid array system (lnatm) microrna expression profile chip. the primers should be designed, and the abi7500 real-time fluorescent quantitative pcr should be applied to amplify, analyze, and verify according to the screen results of the microrna chip in order to screen out the significant differentially expressed microrna. results: histological detection showed that the pancreas of the mice in control group d was fibrosis gradually and the islet frame was relatively disordered and significantly atrophied. groups a, b, and c have no islet hypertrophy or atrophy and the degree of fibrosis of the pancreas has reduced. according to the gene chip detection, there are four significantly differently expressed micrornas in pancreas tissue and blood among the group a, b, and c, among which mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-22 were down-regulated expressed while the mirna-1 was upregulated expressed. bioinformatics analysis showed that the target genes of 4 differentially regulated microrna genes were related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, glucose metabolism, and angiogenesis. the expression of microrna in pancreatic tissue and blood of nod rats was highly consistent. conclusions: microrna expression file of pancreatic tissue and blood can be changed during the intervention of the nod rat model with exendin-4. microrna that indicates the differential expression may take part in the recovering process of the nod pancreatic trauma. at the same time, the administration of exendin- 4 can protect nod mice, reduce its pancreatic tissue fibrosis, and regulate molecular markers of pancreatic cells in size and pancreatic mast cells. this may be one of the main mechanisms of pancreatic injury in diabetes prevention.
hydraulics	groundwater recharge processes, water-rock interaction and the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers of the galilee and eromanga basins in central queensland, australia, were investigated using stable (delta h-2, delta c-18 and (87)sr/sr-86) and radiogenic ((ci)-c-36) isotopes and dissolved methane concentrations, complemented by major ion chemistry. the central eromanga and the upper sequence of the galilee basins are both sub-basins of the great artesian basin (gab), and the coal seams of the galilee basin are currently explored for their potential as commercial coal seam gas deposits. in order to understand the potential influence of depressurisation of coal seams required to release the gas on adjacent aquifers, a detailed understanding of recharge processes and groundwater hydraulics of these basins prior to any development is required. each of the different isotope systems were used in this study to provide different information on specific processes. for example, the assessment of delta c-13 and sr-87/sr-86 ratios suggested that carbonate dissolution is one of the major processes controlling the water chemistry within some aquifers. in addition, the combined assessment of delta h-2, delta o-18 and major ion chemistry indicates that transpiration is the primary process controlling the solute concentration in the gab recharge area, whereas evaporation appears to be less significant. groundwaters in the galilee basin recharge area (outside the limits of the gab) are different to any groundwater within the gab units. this difference is attributed to the dissolution of potassium-bearing micas, which are absent in the gab. groundwater age estimates based on cl-36/cl ratios suggest that there is a steady increase along the flow paths, and this lack of anomalous age estimates from the recharge areas to the deeper parts of the basin indicates that there is no evidence for regional inter-aquifer mixing based in isotopes only. however, dissolved methane concentrations and groundwater chemistry near faults indicates the potential mix of gas and/or water from the coal seams into the gab groundwaters, suggesting that there may be local influence of faults as gas/water conduits.

immunology	this study examined the effect of resistance exercise on the production, recruitment, percentage, and adhesion characteristics of granulocytes with andwithout polyphenol (ppb) supplementation. thirty-eight untrained men were randomized into three groups: ppb (n=13, 21.8 +/- 2.5 years, 171.2 +/- 5.5cm, 71.2 +/- 8.2kg), placebo (pl; n=15, 21.6 +/- 2.5years, 176.5 +/- 4.9cm, 84.0 +/- 15.7kg), or control (con; n=10, 23.3 +/- 4.3years, 173.7 +/- 12.6cm, 77.3 +/- 16.3kg). blood samples were obtained pre (pre), immediately (ip), 1h (1h), 5h (5h), 24h (24h), 48h (48h), and 96h (96h) postresistance exercise (ppb/pl) or rest (con). fine-needle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis at pre, 1h, 5h, and 48h. plasma concentrations and intramuscular content of interleukin-8 (il-8), granulocyte (g-csf), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) were analyzed via multiplex assays. changes in relative number of circulating granulocytes and adhesion receptor (cd11b) were assessed using flow cytometry. intramuscular il-8 was significantly elevated at 1h, 5h, and 48h (p<0.001). area under the curve analysis indicated a greater intramuscular il-8 content in pl than ppb (p=0.011). across groups, circulating g-csf was elevated from pre at ip (p<0.001), 1h (p=0.011), and 5h (p=0.025), while gm-csf was elevated at ip (p<0.001) and 1h (p=0.007). relative number of granulocytes was elevated at 1h (p<0.001), 5h (p<0.001), and 24h (p=0.005, p=0.006) in ppb and pl, respectively. across groups, granulocyte cd11b expression was upregulated from pre to ip (p<0.001) and 1h (p=0.015). results indicated an increase in circulating cd11b on granulocytes, and il-8 within the muscle following intense resistance exercise. polyphenol supplementation may attenuate the il-8 response, however, did not affect granulocyte percentage and adhesion molecule expression in peripheral blood following resistance exercise.
northern_blotting	mammalian embryonic implantation requires reciprocal interactions between implantation-competent blastocysts and a receptive uterus. some micrornas might play a key role during embryo implantation in the mouse, but the let-7a expression profiles in the rat uterus during peri-implantation are unknown. in the study, the expression of let-7a in the uterus during early pregnancy, pseudopregnancy, artificial decidualization and activation of delayed implantation was detected by northern blotting and in situ hybridization. the effect of steroid hormones on let-7a expression was also detected by northern blotting and in situ hybridization. here, we found that the expression level of let-7a was higher on gestation day 6-7 (g.d. 6-7) in rats than oil g.d.4-5 and g.d.8-9. let-7a was specifically localized in glandular and luminal epithelia and decidua. the expression of let-7a was not significantly different in the pseudopregnant uterus and increased significantly in the uteri of rats subjected to artificial decidualization and activation of delayed implantation. treatment with estradiol-17 beta or progesterone significantly increased let-7a expression. thus, let-7a expression was significantly induced by the process of embryo invasion, and this increased expression level was mainly induced by active blastocysts and decidualization during the window of implantation, implying that let-7a may participate in endometrial decidualization. steroid hormones, estradiol-17 beta or progesterone stimulated let-7a expression.
computer-aided_design	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to provide a new approach involving guidelines and supporting techniques that guarantees all needed space for appropriate product maintenance. design/methodology/approach - the approach is based on two major areas: field survey to understand how maintainability parameter is applied and converge theory and practice into a systematic space claim method using computer-aided design (cad) systems to assure proper maintenance procedures at design stages. findings - case studies from a truck industry conducted following the proposed approach contrast the savings that can be achieved by using a proper space claim for aftermarket needs against an unsuitable level of participation by maintenance personnel during the design development. research limitations/implications - this approach is highly dependent on maintenance experts with suitable skills on cad systems. practical implications - products developed according to the approach envisaged can result in following aspects: lower repair time, better maintenance procedures on key components, easier preventive maintenance, less need for special tools, more ergonomic design, better communication between design and service engineers, simplicity and less complex training. social implications - further research on maintainability will provide new information on how to apply this parameter on product development process (pdp), so design teams can better understand and address this relevant issue. the proposed method has been introduced in the pdp of a major multinational automotive company. originality/value - a new process is presented, considering the protection of needed spaces for maintenance procedures throughout the pdp, diverging to other studies that only propose analysis addressing maintainability at singular point in time during the product development. in just one case study presented, savings of us$1.3m were achieved by applying this space claim approach.
northern_blotting	plant beta-1, 3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and in development. very little data are available on the expression of rice glucanases both in developmental tissues and under various stresses. in this study, we cloned and characterized twenty-seven rice beta-1, 3-glucanases (osglu) from at total of 71 putative glucanases. the osglu genes were obtained by pcr from a cdna library and were classified into seven groups (group i to vii) according to their dna or amino acid sequence homology. analysis of the expression of the twenty-seven osglu genes by northern blotting revealed that they were differentially expressed in different developmental tissues as well as in response to plant hormones, biotic stress, high salt etc. osglu11 and 27 in group iv were clearly expressed only in stem and leaf and were also induced strongly by sa (5 mm), aba (200 mu m), and m. grisea. osglu1, 10, 11, and 14 were induced earlier and to higher levels in incompatible m. grisea interaction than in compatible one. taken together, our findings suggest that the twenty-seven rice osglu gene products play diverse roles not only in plant defense but also in hormonal responses and in development.
southern_blotting	facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (fshd) is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy. we retrospectively studied three families (two indian, one nepalese) with 12 affected members (male:female-7:5). mean age at onset of weakness was 17.63 + 5.48 years. patients were classified according to muscle groups affected (f-face, s-scapula, h-humeral, pg-pelvic girdle, p-peroneal, a-loss of independent ambulation): fsh-a (2), four fsh (4), sh (3), fsh-pg (2) and one: f (1). progression of weakness was classified as f>s>p>pg in eight cases, s>f>p in one, static in three. eleven patients had electromyographic findings suggestive of myopathy and one had features of neurogenic involvement. molecular diagnosis was done by southern blotting using probe p13e-11 after digestion of genomic dna with ecori and/or ecori/blni for twelve patients and three unaffected relatives. no ecori fragment smaller than 35 kb was seen in unaffected subjects. size of ecori fragment varied between 17 kb to 27 kb in affected subjects and was constant for affected members of the same family. molecular diagnosis by southern blotting has helped to provide genetic counseling for the families.
thermodynamics	we report on the theoretical and experimental investigations about the ta-hydride formation depending on the temperature for recycling of ta scraps. the structural investigations based on scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffraction (xrd) showed that the amount of hydrogen incorporated into the ta matrix varied with hydridation temperature. the xrd measurement showed that the h/ta mole ratio in ta-hydride increased with increasing the hydridation temperature up to 700 degrees c and then decreased with increasing the temperature furthermore. depending on the hydridation temperature, various phase of ta-hydride, such as tah0.93 and ta2h were formed and this hydride process was verified by thermodynamic analysis.

strength_of_materials	an innovative blended-learning strategy is presented for the subject laboratory of elasticity and strength of materials, based on the use of different tools combining face-to-face methods with e-learning technologies to improve learning outcomes in mechanical engineering. the enhanced teaching environment includes upgraded teaching material, new self-assessment methods, and video clips providing detailed instructions for each practical session. our challenge was to improve the learning method by changing from a model that simply presents the practical sessions to a model that actively involves students in the learning process. the results of an anonymous student satisfaction survey show that these improvements have been very well received; students consider that the new techniques are very useful both for better understanding the subject and for preparing for the oral exam. rates of success demonstrate that the improvements have had a direct and significant impact on performance, as well as reducing the dropout rate. as an overall conclusion, we can state that all the new techniques are effective tools for improving learning outcomes in the degree in mechanical engineering.
cell_biology	cell physiology is impaired before protein aggregation and this may be more relevant than inclusions themselves for neurodegeneration. the present study aimed to characterize an animal model to enable the analysis of the cell biology before and after protein aggregation. ten-month-old lewis rats were exposed either to 1 or 2 mg/kg/day of rotenone, delivered subcutaneously through mini-pumps, for one month. hyperphosphorylated tau, alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta peptide and protein carbonylation (indicative of oxidative stress) were evaluated in the hippocampus, substantia nigra and locus coeruleus through immunohistochemistry or western blot. it was found that 2 mg/kg/day rotenone increased amyloid-beta peptide, hyperphosphorytation of tau and alpha-synuclein. rotenone at 1mg/kg/day did not alter protein levels. protein carbonylation remained unchanged. this study demonstrated that aged lewis rats exposed to a low dose of rotenone is a useful model to study cellular processes before protein aggregation, while the higher dose makes a good model to study the effects of protein inclusions.
molecular_biology	background: the industrial workhorse fungus, trichoderma reesei, is typically exploited for its ability to produce cellulase enzymes, whereas use of this fungus for over-expression of other proteins (homologous and heterologous) is still very limited. identifying transformants expressing target protein is a tedious task due to low transformation efficiency, combined with highly variable expression levels between transformants. routine methods for identification include pcr-based analysis, western blotting, or crude activity screening, all of which are time-consuming techniques. to simplify this screening, we have adapted the 2a peptide system from the foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) to t. reesei to express a readily screenable marker protein that is co-translated with a target protein. the 2a peptide sequence allows multiple independent genes to be transcribed as a single mrna. upon translation, the 2a peptide sequence causes a ""ribosomal skip"" generating two (or more) independent gene products. when the 2a peptide is translated, the ""skip"" occurs between its two c-terminal amino acids (glycine and proline), resulting in the addition of extra amino acids on the c terminus of the upstream protein and a single proline addition to the n terminus of the downstream protein. to test this approach, we have cloned two heterologous proteins on either side of a modified 2a peptide, a secreted cellobiohydrolase enzyme (cel7a from penicillium funiculosum) as our target protein, and an intracellular enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) as our marker protein. using straightforward monitoring of egfp expression, we have shown that we can efficiently monitor the expression of the target cel7a protein. results: co-expression of cel7a and egfp via the fmdv 2a peptide sequence resulted in successful expression of both test proteins in t. reesei. separation of these two polypeptides via the modified 2a peptide was similar to 100% efficient. the cel7a was efficiently secreted, whereas the egfp remained intracellular. both proteins were expressed when cloned in either order, i. e., cel7a-2a-egfp (c2g) or egfp-2a-cel7a (g2c); however, egfp expression and/or functionality were dependent upon the order of transcription. specifically, expression of cel7a was linked to egfp expression in the c2g orientation, whereas expression of cel7a could not be reliably correlated to egfp fluorescence in the g2c construct. whereas egfp stability and/or fluorescence were affected by gene order, cel7a was expressed, secreted, and exhibited the expected functionality in both the g2c and c2g orientations. conclusions: we have successfully demonstrated that two structurally unrelated proteins can be expressed in t. reesei using the fmdv 2a peptide approach; however, the order of the genes can be important. the addition of a single proline to the n terminus of egfp in the c2g orientation did not appear to affect fluorescence, which correlated well with cel7a expression. the addition of 21 amino acids to the c terminus of egfp in the g2c orientation, however, appeared to severely reduce fluorescence and/or stability, which could not be linked with cel7a expression. the molecular biology tool that we have implemented in this study will provide an efficient strategy to test the expression of heterologous proteins in t. reesei, while also providing a novel platform for developing this fungus as an efficient multi-protein-expressing host using a single polycistronic gene expression cassette. an additional advantage of this system is that the co-expressed proteins can be theoretically produced at equimolar ratios, as ( a) they all originate from a single transcript and ( b) unlike internal ribosome entry site ( ires)-mediated polycistronic expression, each cistron should be translated equimolarly as there is no ribosomal dissociation or reloading between cistrons.
polymerase_chain_reaction	a novel three-dimensional dna-aunps network structure amplification strategy was employed to design a lateral flow biosensor by introducing streptavidin coated gold nanoparticles (au-sa) in this paper. they act as amplification probes which aggregate numerous gold nanoparticles (aunps) on test line by forming a threedimensional dna-aunps network structure in the presence of target. sensitive detection of nucleic acid with point-of-care analysis is significant for infectious agent, early diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. the use of these particles in rapid ultrasensitive point of care (poc) lateral flow assays lead to a linear range from 0.1 pm to 250 nm with a limit of detection of 0.01 pm without polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the proposed method could increase the sensitivity by 4 orders of magnitudes than traditional sandwich assays labeled with aunps. furthermore, the assay owns good reproducibility and stability, which will prove practical diagnostic applications.
immunology	the mhc is a highly polymorphic genomic region that encodes the transplantation and immune regulatory molecules. it receives special attention for genetic investigation because of its important role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses and its strong association with numerous infectious and/or autoimmune diseases. the mhc locus was first discovered in the mouse and for the past 50 years it has been studied most intensively in both mice and humans. however, in recent years the macaque species have emerged as some of the more important and advanced experimental animal models for biomedical research into mhc with important human immunodeficiency virus/simian immunodeficiency virus and transplantation studies undertaken in association with precise mhc genotyping and haplotyping methods using sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing. here, in this special issue on 'macaque immunology' we provide a short review of the genomic similarities and differences among the human, macaque and mouse mhc class i and class ii regions, with an emphasis on the association of the macaque class i region with mhc polymorphism, haplotype structure and function.
internal_combustion_engine	tri-generation plants will have an important role in the near future in the residential sector where heating and cooling demands come into play throughout the year. depending on the building 's location, the characteristics of its enclosure and its use, the thermal loads and demands will be different. this article analyses and compares a combined cooling, heating and power (cchp) system tested in the laboratory and a single household located in spain. the cooling capacity is obtained using a reversible heat pump where the compressor is driven directly by a gas engine with internal combustion engine (ice) technology. the tests were carried out in a work bench at three different operating speeds. a variable-speed model is developed in the trnsys simulation environment with an operating strategy following the thermal load (ftl). once the micro-cchp system was modeled with experimental data and validated, it was dynamically simulated to analyze its performance in different climatic zones defined in the spanish ""codigo tecnico de la edificacion"" (cte). this study reveals that the micro-cchp system is suitable in mild weathers during the summer season.

cell_biology	purpose of reviewdendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells which link innate and adaptive immunity, through recognition and presentation of antigen to t cells. although the importance of dendritic cells has been demonstrated in many animal models, their contribution to human immunity remains relatively unexplored in vivo.given their central role in infection, autoimmunity, and malignancy, dendritic cell deficiency or dysfunction would be expected to have clinical consequences.recent findingshuman dendritic cell deficiency disorders, related to gata binding protein 2 (gata2) and interferon regulatory factor 8 (irf8) mutations, have highlighted the importance of dendritic cells and monocytes in primary immunodeficiency diseases and begun to shed light on their nonredundant roles in host defense and immune regulation in vivo. the contribution of dendritic cell and monocyte dysfunction to the pathogenesis of primary immunodeficiency disease phenotypes is becoming increasingly apparent. however, dendritic cell analysis is not yet a routine part of primary immunodeficiency disease workup.summarywidespread uptake of dendritic cell/monocyte screening in clinical practice will facilitate the discovery of novel dendritic cell and monocyte disorders as well as advancing our understanding of human dendritic cell biology in health and disease.
hydraulics	the shape of a sediment particle can reveal part of the particle 's transportation history and is a significant variable in sediment transport mechanics. measuring sediment shapes is a difficult and time-consuming task. a whole sample sediment particle shape quantitative analysis method (wsqam) was applied in this research for sediment statistical analysis. the shape parameter was found using sphericity and roundness descriptors: three samples were collected from the middle reach of the yellow river at different depths. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to obtain sediment particles images. the sphericity and roundness descriptors were represented by the particle aspect ratio (ar) and the fourier shape coefficient (fsc). the fourier series approximation matched the particle outlines. from the statistical results of the whole sediment particle sample, as counted by wsqam based on digital image processing, fine sediment particles with smooth surfaces accounted for approximately 80% of all of the observed sediment particles. for the majority of sediment particles, ar was greater than 0.3 and fsc was less than 0.1. when ar was greater than 0.5, fsc exponentially decayed with ar. when ar was less than 0.5, the two parameters, ar and fsc, should be combined to describe the sediment particle shape. the combined use of these two parameters can provide a reference for future sediment-related calculations. the sediment particle shape analysis model, programmed in fortran, was rapid and flexible. it proved efficient to use wsqam for sediment statistical analysis, and the results were found to be accurate.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the androgen receptor splice variant 7 (ar-v7) is associated with resistance to hormonal therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc). due to limitations of the methods available for ar-v7 analysis, the identification of a reliable detection method may facilitate the use of this biomarker in clinical practice. objective: to confirm ar-v7 as a predictor of resistance to hormonal therapy and develop a new approach to assess ar-v7 by highly sensitive digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddpcr) in plasma-derived exosomal rna. design, setting, and participants: plasma samples were collected from 36 crpc patients before they began second-line hormonal treatment. exosomes were isolated and rna extracted for analysis of ar-v7 by ddpcr. outcome measurements and statistical analysis: the absolute target gene concentration as copies per milliliter (copies/ml) was determined by ddpcr. statistical analyses were performed with spss software (ibm corp., armonk, ny, usa). results and limitations: a total of 26 patients received abiraterone and 10 enzalutamide; 39% of patients were found to be ar-v7 positive (ar-v7(+)). median progression-free survival was significantly longer in ar-v7 negative (ar-v7(-)) versus ar-v7(+) patients (20 vs 3 mo; p < 0.001). overall survival was significantly shorter in ar-v7(+) participants at baseline compared with ar-v7(-) participants (8 mo vs not reached; p < 0.001). conclusions: this study demonstrates that plasma-derived exosomal rna is a reliable source of ar-v7 that can be detected sensitively by ddpcr assay. we also showed that resistance to hormonal therapy may be predicted by ar-v7, making it a clinically relevant biomarker. patient summary: we report a first study on a method for androgen receptor splice variant 7 (ar-v7) detection in rna extracted from cancer cell vesicles released in blood. results confirmed the role of ar-v7 as a predictive biomarker of resistance to hormonal therapy. our assay showed that vesicles are a reliable source of ar-v7 rna and that the method is fast, highly sensitive, and affordable.

northern_blotting	aim: an rna-seq analysis recently identified a 236-nucleotide transcript upstream from mals in salmonella enterica serovar typhi. here, we investigated its molecular characteristics and function. materials & methods: race and northern blotting were used to determine the molecular characteristics of the sequence, and mutagenesis, microarray, immunoblotting and an invasion assay were used to investigate the functions of the transcript. results: the transcript was identified as the mals 5'-untranslated region (utr), which could influence the expression of the flagellar and spi-1 genes and the invasion of hela cells by s. typhi. deletion of bax increased the expression of the invasion genes and the invasive capacity of s. typhi, whereas the expression of the mals 5'-utr reduced the expression of bax. conclusion: the mals 5'-utr reduces the expression of bax and increases the invasive capacity of s. typhi.
molecular_biology	diencephalic defects underlie an array of neurological diseases. previous studies have suggested that retinoic acid (ra) signaling is involved in diencephalic development at late stages of embryonic development, but its roles and mechanisms of action during early neural development are still unclear. here we demonstrate that mice lacking enzymatic activity of the acetyltransferase gcn5 ((gcn5(hat/hat))), which were previously characterized with respect to their exencephalic phenotype, exhibit significant diencephalic expansion, decreased diencephalic ra signaling, and increased diencephalic wnt and shh signaling. using a variety of molecular biology techniques in both cultured neuroepithelial cells treated with a gcn5 inhibitor and forebrain tissue from (gcn5(hat/hat)) embryos, we demonstrate that gcn5, rar alpha/gamma, and the poorly characterized protein tacc1 form a complex in the nucleus that binds specific retinoic acid response elements in the absence of ra. furthermore, ra triggers gcn5-mediated acetylation of tacc1, which results in dissociation of tacc1 from retinoic acid response elements and leads to transcriptional activation of ra target genes. intriguingly, ra signaling defects caused by in vitro inhibition of gcn5 can be rescued through ra-dependent mechanisms that require rar beta. last, we demonstrate that the diencephalic expansion and transcriptional defects seen in (gcn5(hat/hat)) mutants can be rescued with gestational ra supplementation, supporting a direct link between gcn5, tacc1, and ra signaling in the developing diencephalon. together, our studies identify a novel, nonhistone substrate for gcn5 whose modification regulates a previously undescribed, tissue-specific mechanism of ra signaling that is required to restrict diencephalic size during early forebrain development.
manufacturing_engineering	china 's electronics industry has seen a significant development in the last decades. the electronics manufacturing industry has become one of the country 's largest industries. many well-qualified researchers and engineers are needed to meet the demands of the microelectronics industry and research. the fast developing electronics industry challenges the conventional university education. how to innovate the education curriculum to provide qualified engineers for the electronics industry is a challenging task for universities. education program on microelectronic packaging and assembly has been established at guet. in this paper, the experiences of establishing the multi-level education program for the microelectronics manufacturing are briefly summarized. a focus is put on the new bachelor 's degree program of microelectronic manufacturing engineering. the objective, scope and curriculum structure of the education program are proposed, which is with an emphasis on the sectors of electronic packaging, assembly and test. this proposal is supported by the fact of the existing huge demands for the qualified engineers in these sectors. to achieve the goal, the core courses for the educational curriculum and educational means are proposed and discussed. further effort to enhance the educational ability is needed.

cell_biology	pten-induced putative kinase 1 (pink1) was identified initially as a gene upregulated in cancer cells which regulates cellular processes of significance in cancer cell biology, including cell survival, stress resistance and the cell cycle. however, the expression and function of pink1 in non small cell lung cancer (nsclc) has not been determined yet. we demonstrated high pink1 expression in nsclc tumor tissues and cell lines as assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry (ihc) assays. in addition, ihc analysis revealed that pink1 expression was associated with a more invasive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. furthermore, in vitro studies using upregulation and knockdown of pink1 confirmed that pink1 promoted cell proliferation of nsclc, which might be through as the nf-kb pathway. moreover, we also demonstrated that downregulation of pink1 enhanced cisplatin (cddp)-induced nsclc cell apoptosis. together, our findings indicate that pink1 plays a significant role in nsclc progression and chemoresistance, and highlights its potential role as a target in future anticancer therapies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	chinese tallow (sapium sebiferum l.) is a promising landscape and bioenergy plant. measuring gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) can provide valuable information on gene function. stably expressed reference genes for normalization are a prerequisite for ensuring the accuracy of the target gene expression level among different samples. however, the reference genes in chinese tallow have not been systematically validated. in this study, 12 candidate reference genes (185, gapdh, ubq, rps15, sand, tip41, 60s, act7, pdf2, apt, tbp and tub) were investigated with qrt-pcr in 18 samples, including those from different tissues, from plants treated with sucrose and cold stresses. the data were calculated with four common algorithms, genorm, bestkeeper, normfinder, and the delta cycle threshold (delta ct). tip41 and gapdh were the most stable for the tissue-specific experiment, gapdh and 60s for cold treatment, and gapdh and ubq for sucrose stresses, while the least stable genes were 60s, tip41, and 18s respectively. the comprehensive results showed apt, gapdh, and ubq to be the top-ranked stable genes across all the samples. the stability of 60s was the lowest during all experiments. these selected reference genes were further validated by comparing the expression profiles of the chalcone synthase gene in chinese tallow in different samples. the results will help to improve the accuracy of gene expression studies in chinese tallow.
genetics	background: hereditary vitamin d-resistant rickets (hvdrr) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the vitamin d receptor (vdr) gene. variable phenotypes have been associated with these mutations, and some of these were linked to the effects they have on the interacting partners of vdr, mainly the retinoic x receptor (rxr). methods: we examined four patients with hvdrr from three unrelated lebanese families. all parents were consanguineous with normal phenotype. we used sanger sequencing to identify mutations in the coding exons of vdr. results: two homozygous mutations (p.r391s and p.h397p), both in exon 9 of the vdr gene, were identified. phenotype/genotype association was not possible even for the same mutation. alopecia was seen only with the p.r391s mutation. despite a comparable rachitic bone disease, the patients showed different responsiveness to large doses of alfacalcidol (1-alpha-hydroxy vitamin d3) supplementation. conclusions: this is the first report of vdr mutations in lebanon with promising clinical outcomes despite the severity of the phenotypes.
polymerase_chain_reaction	gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the digestive tract, with an incidence of 1.1 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year. a group of experts from the spanish society of pathology and the spanish society of oncology met to discuss a brief update on gists and agree on aspects relating to the pathological and molecular diagnosis of these tumors. gists are generally solitary, well-circumscribed lesions of variable size (< 10 mm-35 cm) that may present with intra- or extra-luminal parietal growth or a mixed-type (hourglass) growth pattern. histologically, they are unencapsulated neoplasms displaying expansive growth and spindle-shaped (70%), epithelioid (20%), or mixed cellularity (10%). mitotic activity is generally moderate or low and should be evaluated only in areas with high cellularity or higher mitotic frequency. the great majority of gists harbour mutually exclusive activating mutations in genes coding for the type iii receptor tyrosine kinases kit and pdgfra; less commonly, gists have also been reported to display mutations elsewhere, including braf and nf1 and sdh-complex genes. the method most widely used to detect kit and pdgfra mutations is amplification of the exons involved by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing (sanger method) of these amplification products. molecular analyses should always specify the type of analysis performed, the region or mutations evaluated, and the sensitivity of the detection method employed.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the function of rhog, a rac1 activator, was explored in the ovary during ovarian follicular development and pathological conditions. with the help of immunoblotting and immunolocalization, we determined the expression and localization of rhog in normal (estrous cycle) and polycystic ovaries using sprague dawley (sd) rat model. employing polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, we analyzed the transcript and expression levels of downstream molecules of rhog, dock1, and rac1 in the polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) ovary along with normal antral follicular theca and granulosa cells after dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) supplementation. the effect of rhog knockdown on dock1, vav, and rac1 expression was evaluated in the human ovarian cells (skov3), theca cells, and granulosa cells from sd rats with the help of flow cytometry. oocyte at secondary follicles along with stromal cells showed optimal expression of rhog. immunoblotting of rhog revealed its maximum expression at diestrus and proestrus, which was downregulated at estrus stage. mild immunostaining of rhog was also present in the theca and granulosa cells of the secondary and antral follicles. polycystic ovary exhibited weak immunostaining for rhog and that was corroborated by immunoblotting-based investigations. rhog effectors dock1 and elmo1 were found reduced in the ovary in pcos condition/dhea. rhog silencing reduced the expression of dock1 and rac1 in the theca and granulosa cells from sd rat antral follicles and that was mirrored in the human ovarian cells. collectively, rhog can mediate signaling through downstream effectors dock1 and rac1 during ovarian follicular development (theca and granulosa cells and oocyte), but dhea downregulated them in the pcos ovary.
fluid_mechanics	the laminar boundary layer flow and heat transfer of casson non-newtonian fluid from an inclined (solar collector) plate in the presence of thermal and hydrodynamic slip conditions is analysed. the inclined plate surface is maintained at a constant temperature. the boundary layer conservation equations, which are parabolic in nature, are normalized into non-similar form and then solved numerically with the well-tested, efficient, implicit, stable keller-box finite-difference scheme. increasing velocity slip induces acceleration in the flow near the inclined plate surface. increasing velocity slip consistently enhances temperatures throughout the boundary layer regime. an increase in thermal slip parameter strongly decelerates the flow and also reduces temperatures in the boundary layer regime. an increase in casson rheological parameter acts to elevate considerably the velocity and this effect is pronounced at higher values of tangential coordinate. temperatures are however very slightly decreased with increasing values of casson rheological parameter.
fluid_mechanics	the flow characteristics around the proximal and distal stenoses in tandem vessel models are experimentally investigated with varying flow rates (q=0.25, 0.5,1.0 l/min), interspacing distances (l=3, 6,10 of diameter d) and severities (s=50%, 75% reduction in diameter). when the interspacing l is larger than 10 d, no fluid-dynamic interaction is observed. the flow between the proximal and distal stenoses becomes stabilized (turbulence intensity of <3%) as the interspacing distance decreases. when the severity s is 75%, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs at a flow rate higher than 0.5 l/min, although the interspacing distance l is 3 d. formation of recirculation flow is restricted by the presence of distal stenosis as the interspacing distance decreases. in this case, the flow between the stenoses is focused on the central region. the center-line velocity at the neck of the distal stenosis is approximately 10-15% higher than that of the proximal stenosis with equal severity of s=50%. when the inlet flow is center-focused, the lengths of the recirculation and the jet core behind the distal stenosis increase with decrease in interspacing distance l. when the inlet flow is turbulent, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs early as the interspacing distance l is reduced. when the upstream proximal stenosis exhibits increased severity, the pressure drop is measured to be 20% compared with that when the severity of the downstream distal stenosis is increased at the flow rate of q=1.0 l/min.

enzymology	. background: a key feature of factorixa is its allosteric transformation from an enzymatically latent form into a potent procoagulant. although several small molecules have been found to be capable of partially affecting fixa function (i.e. ethylene glycol, ca2+, and low molecular weight heparin [lmwh]), the resulting modest changes in peptidolytic activity have made the study of their mechanisms of action challenging. as these effects provide hints about potential regulatory forces that may be operational in the full expression of fixa coagulant activity, their description remains of great interest. studies of crystal structures have yielded insights into the structural changes induced by these effectors, but there remains a paucity of information to correlate any given structural change with specific consequences for fixa function.objectives: to correlate structural changes induced by these modulators with defined consequences for fixa substrate discrimination and function.methods: a peptidomics-based mass spectrometry (ms) approach was used to examine the patterns of hydrolysis of four combinatorial chemistry-derived pentapeptide libraries by fixa under various conditions in a soluble, active enzyme system.results: ethylene glycol specifically altered the s3 subsite of fixa to render it more tolerant to side chains at the p3 substrate position, whereas ca2+ enhanced tolerance at the s2 subsite. in contrast, lmwh altered both the s2 and s1' subsites.conclusions: these results demonstrate the role of plasticity in regulating fixa function with respect to discrimination of extended substrate sequences, as well as providing crucial insights into active site modulations that may be capitalized on by various physiologic cofactors of fixa and in future drug design.
hydraulics	the release of water from storage compartments to the transpiration stream is an important functional mechanism that provides the buffering of sudden fluctuations in water potential. the ability of tissues to release water per change in water potential, referred to as hydraulic capacitance, is assumed to be associated with the anatomy of storage tissues. however, information about how specific anatomical parameters determine capacitance is limited. in this study, we measured sapwood capacitance (c) in terminal branches and roots of five temperate tree species (fagus sylvatica l., picea abies l., quercus robur l., robinia pseudoacacia l., tilia cordata mill.). capacitance was calculated separately for water released mainly from capillary (c-i; open vessels, tracheids, fibres, intercellular spaces and cracks) and elastic storage compartments (c-ii; living parenchyma cells), corresponding to two distinct phases of the moisture release curve. we found that c was generally higher in roots than branches, with c-i being 3-11 times higher than c-ii. sapwood density and the ratio of dead to living xylem cells were most closely correlated with c. in addition, the magnitude of c-i was strongly correlated with fibre/tracheid lumen area, whereas c-ii was highly dependent on the thickness of axial parenchyma cell walls. our results indicate that water released from capillary compartments predominates over water released from elastic storage in both branches and roots, suggesting the limited importance of parenchyma cells for water storage in juvenile xylem of temperate tree species. contrary to intact organs, water released from open conduits in our small wood samples significantly increased c-i at relatively high water potentials. linking anatomical parameters with the hydraulic capacitance of a tissue contributes to a better understanding of water release mechanisms and their implications for plant hydraulics.
molecular_biology	the construction of physical three-dimensional (3d) models of biomolecules can uniquely contribute to the study of the structure-function relationship. 3d structures are most often perceived using the two-dimensional and exclusively visual medium of the computer screen. converting digital 3d molecular data into real objects enables information to be perceived through an expanded range of human senses, including direct stereoscopic vision, touch, and interaction. such tangible models facilitate new insights, enable hypothesis testing, and serve as psychological or sensory anchors for conceptual information about the functions of biomolecules. recent advances in consumer 3d printing technology enable, for the first time, the cost-effective fabrication of high-quality and scientifically accurate models of biomolecules in a variety of molecular representations. however, the optimization of the virtual model and its printing parameters is difficult and time consuming without detailed guidance. here, we provide a guide on the digital design and physical fabrication of biomolecule models for research and pedagogy using open source or low-cost software and low-cost 3d printers that use fused filament fabrication technology.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: to quantify cell free fetal dna (cffdna) with fetal specific epigenetic marker, hypermethylated rassf1a, in maternal plasma of normal pregnant women from 20 weeks of gestation and to assess its relationship with maternal age, height, pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index (bmi). methods: hundred normal pregnant women within the gestational age of 21-40 weeks were randomly selected and grouped into five (n = 20). group 1: 21-24, group 2: 25-28, group 3: 29-32, group 4: 33-36 and group 5: 37-40 weeks. maternal plasma dna was extracted, digested with methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, bstui and the fetal specific dna (cffdna) was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). results: the mean hypermethylated rassf1a concentrations in different gestational groups were group 1: 30.1 +/- 14.9, group 2: 52.6 +/- 22.18, group 3: 93.2 +/- 19.08, group 4: 172.8 +/- 26.81 and group 5: 337.8 +/- 52.9 copies/ml. pearson 's correlation analysis showed highly significant positive correlation between cffdna and gestational age (r = 0.899, p < 0.001). bmi was also found to be positively related to cffdna (r = 0.217, p < 0.05). however, it did not show any correlation with maternal age, height and pre-pregnancy weight. conclusions: the gestational age-dependent increase of hypermethylated rassf1a; the fetal specific epigenetic marker in maternal plasma was demonstrated, in an indian study group of normal pregnant women. findings would form the basis of future studies involving pregnancy complications that would aid in the early diagnosis of placental pathologies with hypermethylated rassf1a.
northern_blotting	biological functions of globo-series glycosphingolipids are not well understood. in this study, murine cdnas of two glycosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of globo-series glycolipids and mrna expression of those genes were analyzed. distribution of their products was also analyzed. murine cdnas for gb3/cd77 synthase and gb4 synthase predicted that both of them are type ii membrane proteins with 348 and 331 amino acids, respectively. in northern blotting, gb3/cd77 synthase gene was mainly expressed in kidney and lung but also detected in many other tissues. gb4 synthase was expressed in brain, heart, kidney, liver, skin, and testis. in the immunohistological analysis, gb3/cd77 was mainly expressed in the proximal tubules as revealed with coincidental expression with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace). in spleen, it was detected in pre-b cells in the peripheral region of the white pulp, as suggested with coincidental expression with cd10. it was also expressed on the endothelia of the alveolar capillaries in lung and on the sebaceous ducts aside of the hair follicles. gb4 was also detected mainly on the proximal tubules in kidney and on the endothelia of the alveolar capillaries in lung as gb3/cd77. but it was also detected on the epithelium of the bronchus, seminiferous tubules and tails of spermatozoa in testis, blood vessels of choroids plexus and endothelial cells in brain, and central and hepatoportal veins in liver. the expression patterns of two genes and their products almost corresponded with some exception. the results would provide essential information for the functional studies of globo-series glycolipids.
northern_blotting	recent studies in our laboratories have shown that protein kinase c delta (pkc delta) is essential for insulin-induced glucose transport in skeletal muscle, and that insulin rapidly stimulates pkc delta activity skeletal muscle. the purpose of this study was to examine mechanisms of regulation of pkc delta protein availability. studies were done on several models of mammalian skeletal muscle and utilized whole cell lysates of differentiated myotubes. pkc delta protein levels were determined by western blotting techniques, and pkc delta rna levels were determined by northern blotting, rt-pcr and real-time rt-pcr. insulin stimulation increased pkc delta protein levels in whole cell lysates. this effect was not due to an inhibition by insulin of the rate of pkc delta protein degradation. insulin also increased 35 s-methionine incorporation into pkc delta within 5-15 min. pretreatment of cells with transcription or translation inhibitors abrogated the insulin-induced increase in pkc delta protein levels. we also found that insulin rapidly increased the level of pkc delta rna, an effect abolished by inhibitors of transcription. the insulin-induced increase in pkc delta expression was not reduced by inhibition of either p13 kinase or map kinase, indicating that these signaling mechanisms are not involved, consistent with insulin activation of pkc delta. studies on cells transfected with the pkc delta promoter demonstrate that insulin activated the promoter within 5 min. this study indicates that the expression of pkc delta may be regulated in a rapid manner during the course of insulin action in skeletal muscle and raise the possibility that pkc delta may be an immediate early response gene activated by insulin.

thermodynamics	the ionic composition of intracellular space is rigorously maintained in the expense of high-energy expenditure. it has been recently postulated that the cytoplasmic ionic composition is optimized so the energy cost of the fluctuations of calcium ion concentration is minimized. specifically, thermodynamic arguments have been produced to show that the presence of potassium ions at concentrations higher than 100 mm reduce extend of the energy dissipation required for the dilution of calcium cations. no such effect has been measured when sodium ions were present in the solution or when the other divalent cation magnesium was diluted. the experimental observation has been interpreted as the indication of the formation of ionic clusters composed of calcium, chloride and potassium. in order to test the possibility that such clusters may be preserved in biological space, the thermodynamics of ionic mixtures dilution in solutions containing albumins and model lipid bilayers have been measured. obtained thermograms clearly demonstrate that the energetics of calcium/potassium mixture is qualitatively different from calcium/sodium mixture indicating that the presence of the biologically relevant quantities of proteins and membrane hydrophilic surfaces do not interfere with the properties of the intracellular aqueous phase.
immunology	background: fractional exhaled nitric oxide (feno) is a safe and convenient test for assessing t(h)2 airway inflammation, which is potentially useful in the management of patients with chronic cough. objective: to summarize the current evidence on the diagnostic usefulness of feno for predicting inhaled corticosteroid (ics) responsiveness in patients with chronic cough. methods: a systematic literature review was conducted to identify articles published in peer-reviewed journals up to february 2015, without language restriction. we included studies that reported the usefulness of feno (index test) for predicting ics responsiveness (reference standard) in patients with chronic cough (target condition). the data were extracted to construct a 2 3 2 accuracy table. study quality was assessed with quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2. results: we identified 5 original studies (2 prospective and 3 retrospective studies). we identified considerable heterogeneities in study design and outcome definitions, and thus were unable to perform a meta-analysis. the proportion of ics responders ranged from 44% to 59%. sensitivity and specificity ranged from 53% to 90%, and from 63% to 97%, respectively. the reported area under the curve ranged from about 0.60 to 0.87; however, studies with a prospective design and a lower prevalence of asthma had lower area under the curve values. none measured placebo effects or objective cough frequency. conclusions: we did not find strong evidence to support the use of feno tests for predicting ics responsiveness in chronic cough. further studies need to have a randomized, placebo-controlled design, and should use validated measurement tools for cough. standardization would facilitate the development of clinical evidence.

southern_blotting	the lepidopteran ostrinia furnacalis is one of the most serious pests of maize production. the cry1c proteins are group of bacillus thuringiensis (bt) proteins that are toxic to the intestine of insects. overexpression of cry1c protein has led to increased resistance to lepidopteran pests in several crops. in the present study, the synthetic cry1c* gene that was previously tested in rice was introduced into maize hi-ii genotypes via biolistic gun-mediated transformation. a total of nine independent putative callus were obtained and 87 transgenic plants were positive with cry1c* according to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis. three highly insect-resistant transgenic plants, zmkc-2-3, zmkc-3-2, and zmkc-3-5, were further confirmed by pcr analysis, field assessment, and genomic southern blotting in the t-3 generations. insect bioassays were conducted in both the field and the laboratory, and showed that progeny of the three transgenic lines were significantly resistant to lepidopteran maize pests during the whole development and growth period. the stable integration and expression of the cry1c* in the three transgenic plants' progeny were confirmed by reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (elisa) methods. hybrids were produced by crossing transgenic line zmkc-2-3 with the elite inbred line zheng58. there was small variation among the hybrids and backcross offspring, indicating that these cry1c* transgenic lines can be used to produce insect-resistant hybrids and served as insect-resistant sources for the development of bt maize.
molecular_biology	fibrolamellar carcinoma is a unique type of hepatocellular carcinoma with a distinctive predilection for young patients without underlying liver disease, characteristic large neoplastic cells with intervening, dense fibrosis, co-expression of keratin 7 and cd68 and activation of protein kinase a (most often by formation of dnajbi-prkaca). fibrolamellar carcinoma has a similar prognosis to conventional hepatocellular carcinomas arising in non-cirrhotic livers. the current american joint cancer committee staging system does not provide optimal stratification of patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma and an alternate systems should be considered in the future. the only effective treatment for fibrolamellar carcinoma is complete resection. novel therapies may be on the horizon as investigation into the molecular biology of fibrolamellar carcinoma continues.

manufacturing_engineering	purpose - the intention of this research paper is to shed light on the key factors influencing the human resource management (hrm) performance of first tier managers (ftms), and the vital importance that a holistic strategic framework can have in this regard. design/methodology/approach - the research paper uses an up-to-date historical approach and, additionally, draws on detailed case study evidence from an aerospace manufacturing/engineering company via manually and electronically analysed in-depth semi-structured interview and company documentation. findings - the case study findings reveal that the ftm 's hrm performance is greatly influenced by a group of four key factors, and their interrelationships. research limitations/implications - the literature survey was mainly industry-specific (manufacturing), and the sample was restricted to one sector (aerospace), as well as one case study organisation. furthermore, the views of ftms' staff are not directly represented. originality/value - the ftms' hrm role shows no signs of abating, in addition, questions regarding their performance of this role have increasingly emerged. this has become more evident as organisations have continued to expand the ftms' role by devolving greater hrm responsibilities to them, and their performance of the role demonstrates that many ftms are ill equipped to perform their hrm duties to the required standard. however, the vital importance that a holistic strategic framework (which encompasses the four key factors influencing their performance) can have on their performance of this role is not acknowledged. the present research paper, gives an empirical example of a case study, and therefore provides a springboard to address the weakness in the literature.
manufacturing_engineering	one result of globalization is the rapid growth of offshoring, i.e., the outsourcing of functions and jobs to offshore locations. in the usa, offshoring has progressed to the point where it already affects everyday lives, from the cars we drive (of which a large portion of the work and components are outsourced) to computers (which are typically manufactured offshore and shipped back to the usa), to electronic diagnostics (where calls are answered overseas). this phenomenon has implications on our lives and on the jobs that engineers and scientists will assume both now and in the future. further, it is something that all highly developed and even some lesser-developed countries must face. consequently, the growth of outsourcing will have a major impact on the educational objectives of engineering programs and the resultant engineering curricula worldwide. this paper presents recent data on product and job offshore migrations and discusses the various dimensions of this phenomenon. in addition to the potential loss of engineering and other high-end technical jobs, sociological and cultural aspects, intellectual property issues, strategic planning concerns, and macro-economic issues are presented. for example, the effects of offshoring on the societal fabric of the countries that are recipients of manufacturing and service center outsourcing, such as china and india, are significant, rapid, and controversial. offshoring has also begun to change the way that engineering programs in these countries educate their students. in addition, intellectual property issues create a major risk to companies considering outsourcing to certain less-developed countries. these issues can be broadly categorized into: the robustness and strength of intellectual property laws, and the degree to which these laws are implemented and enforced. further, such factors as currency fluctuations and geo-political conditions can substantially impact outsourcing decisions and profitability. the phenomenon of offshoring, which is now affecting engineering careers, will play a major role in shaping engineering education worldwide. the next generation of engineers will need to possess the ability to work seamlessly across cultures, have outstanding communication skills and be familiar with the principles of project management, logistics, and systems integration. some educational models that begin to address these requirements will be presented.

machine_design	electromagnetic design of a 1.12-mw, 18 000-r/min high-speed permanent-magnet motor (hspmm) is carried out based on the analysis of pole number, stator slot number, rotor outer diameter, air-gap length, permanent magnet material, thickness, and pole arc. the no-load and full-load performance of the hspmm is investigated in this paper by using 2-d finite element method (fem). in addition, the power losses in the hspmm including core loss, winding loss, rotor eddy current loss, and air friction loss are predicted. based on the analysis, a prototype motor is manufactured and experimentally tested to verify the machine design.
southern_blotting	cotyledons from 8-day-old seedlings of lotus corniculatus were transformed with a gene encoding the avian influenza (h5n1) hemagglutinin (ha) under the control of the camv35s promoter along with matrix attachment regions using agrobacterium-mediated transformation. the ha gene was detected in genomic dna from transformed plants by pcr and southern blotting. immunoblot analysis of the plant-derived protein revealed the presence of the avian influenza (h5n1) ha. the elisa results showed that the maximum expression level of the ha protein is up to 0.00786% of the total soluble protein. this is the first report of successful expression of the avian influenza (h5n1) ha in transgenic l. corniculatus, cultivar leo.
fluid_mechanics	we explore the two-dimensional flow around a circular cylinder with the aim of elucidating the changes in the topology of the vorticity field that lead to the formation of the karman vortex street. specifically, we analyse the formation and disappearance of extremal points of vorticity, which we consider to he feature points for vortices. the basic vortex creation mechanism is shown to he a topological cusp bifurcation in the vorticity field, where a saddle and an extremum of the vorticity are created simultaneously. we demonstrate that vortices are first created approximately 100 diameters downstream of the cylinder, at a reynolds number, re-k, which is slightly larger than the critical reynolds number, r-ecrit approximate to 46, at which the flow becomes time periodic. for re slightly above re-k, the newly created vortices disappear again a short distance further downstream. as re is further increased, the points of creation and disappearance move rapidly upstream and downstream, respectively, and the karman vortex street persists over increasingly large streamwise distances.
southern_blotting	a full-length citrate synthase gene designated magcs was isolated from a banana fruit cdna library, which contained a 1885 bp fragment carrying a 1542 bp open reading frame (orf) that encodes a 513 amino acid protein. magcs includes the glyoxysomal targeting signal pst2, an oxaloacetic acid binding site and a citrate synthase active site. southern blotting showed that the banana genome has two copies of magcs. magcs is constitutively expressed in all organs with high levels in the fruit and the lowest levels in the leaves. with natural ripening, the magcs expression pattern was similar to that of ethylene production and respiration rate. magcs expression could be induced by ethylene and inhibited by the ethylene receptor inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-mcp), which is in accordance with ripening-related ethylene synthesis and respiration rate, and demonstrates that magcs is associated with ethylene biosynthesis. oxaloacetic acid (oa) accelerated fruit ripening, and in contrast, citric acid (ca) delayed it. the expression of magcs, the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (acc) oxidase gene 1 (maaco1, aj223232) and the acc synthase gene i (maacs1, ab021906) was evaluated by real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr), which showed that the expression of magcs, maaco1, and maacs1 were greatly improved by oa and suppressed by ca. these results indicate that magcs plays an important role in postharvest banana fruit ripening, and that oa and ca could affect fruit ripening. this effect on climacteric ethylene and ripening progress was due to the regulation of magcs, maaco1, and maacs1 expression.

internal_combustion_engine	in this paper, a small remote area which is located in nigeria has been considered as a model to be tested by a managing scheme for providing both electricity and water. in this strategy, the groundwater is pumped into a water tank which can be later used for supplying required irrigation and drinking water. a pat (pump as turbine) is used as a hybrid system for supplying electricity and water as well as storing water in the water tank. also, a pv (photovoltaic plant), a package of batteries (bat) in addition to a diesel ice (internal combustion engine) are used and optimized along with the best size of devices and managing system, with the purpose of obtaining the maximum economical operating strategy. in this paper, two cases are considered to assess the effectiveness of the system under study. firstly, all of the mentioned devices are used to show how internal combustion engine system dominates all the other components due to the low cost of fuel. in the second case, all renewable resources have been exploited and optimized in order to make a 100% renewable system with least possible cost. having about 53 variables makes this problem very complicated which requires to be solved by an algorithm with more accuracy. therefore, a mgsa (modified gravitational search algorithm) with an adapted mutation tactic is used to find the best cost and management strategy. in the first case, although the cost of diesel oil is very low, by using the pat, about 5% of diesel oil consumption is reduced. in the second case, in order to make a 100% renewable system, the size of pv is enlarged approximately 16 times in comparison with the first case. the hybrid pv-pat storing structure is capable to deliver the water for irrigation and domestic requirements as well as 9% of the electricity needed for the rural community.

genetics	sweet chestnut is a tree of great economic (fruit and wood production), ecological, and cultural importance in europe. a large-scale landscape genetic analysis of natural populations of sweet chestnut across europe is applied to (1) evaluate the geographic patterns of genetic diversity, (2) identify spatial coincidences between genetic discontinuities and geographic barriers, and (3) propose certain chestnut populations as reservoirs of genetic diversity for conservation and breeding programs. six polymorphic microsatellite markers were used for genotyping 1608 wild trees sampled in 73 european sites. the geostatistical idw technique (arcgis 9.3) was used to produce maps of genetic diversity parameters (he, ar, par) and a synthetic map of the population membership (q value) to the different gene pools. genetic barriers were investigated using barrier 2.2 software and their locations were overlaid on a digital elevation model (gtopo30). the diva-gis software was used to propose priority areas for conservation. high values of genetic diversity (he) and allelic richness (ar) were observed in the central area of c. sativa 's european distribution range. the highest values of private allelic richness (par) were found in the eastern area. three main gene pools and a significant genetic barrier separating the eastern from the central and western populations were identified. areas with high priority for genetic conservation were indicated in georgia, eastern turkey, and italy. our results increase knowledge of the biogeographic history of c. sativa in europe, indicate the geographic location of different gene pools, and identify potential priority reservoirs of genetic diversity.
cell_biology	background: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by bacteria and their virulence factors. bortezomib (btz) is the first proteasome inhibitor for clinical treatment of malignancies. its anticancer activity is accompanied by an anti-inflammatory effect. however, there are few reports about its anti-inflammatory effect and underlying mechanism in periodontal disease, especially on human periodontal ligament cells (hpdlcs), which are considered a promising cell-based therapy for treating periodontitis. methods: hpdlcs were treated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) and pre-treated with btz. mrna and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, and il-8 were determined. the anti-inflammatory mechanism of btz was studied. further, experimental rat periodontitis was induced with ligature and lps injection, and simultaneously and locally treated with btz (three injections/week). four weeks after treatment, microcomputed tomography, immunohistochemical, and histopathologic analyses were performed. results: bortezomib administration at safe concentrations (<= 1 nm) inhibited production of proinflammatory cytokines in lps-stimulated hpdlcs via nuclear factor (nf)-kappa b, p38/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein-1 pathways. moreover, in the lps and ligature-induced periodontitis rat model, btz suppressed expression of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, and il-8, reduced the ratio of receptor activator of nf-kappa b ligand/osteoprotegerin, and prevented alveolar bone absorption. conclusion: these findings demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity of btz against periodontal inflammatory response and present btz as a promising therapy for periodontal disease.

southern_blotting	the intragenomic distribution of five retrotransposon families (297, 1731, copia, mdg1 and roo) in the species of the melanogaster complex was studied by comparing results of the southern blotting technique in males and females with those of in situ hybridization. the degree of structural polymorphism of each family in the different species was also investigated by restriction enzyme analysis. it was found that genomic distribution is a trait that depends on the family and species. the distribution of roo is mainly euchromatic in the four species and 1731 is heterochromatic, but the distribution of families 297, copia and mdg1 is markedly different in the melanogaster and simulans clades. these families were mainly euchromatic in d. melanogaster but heterochromatic in its sibling species. in the simulans clade most copia and mdg1 elements are located on chromosome y. differences in genomic distribution are unrelated with structural conservation. the relation of intragenomic distribution to phylogeny, transpositional activity and the role of the host genome are discussed.
genetics	was the 1993/1994 fatal canine distemper virus (cdv) epidemic in lions and spotted hyaenas in the serengeti ecosystem caused by the recent spillover of a virulent domestic dog strain or one well adapted to these noncanids? we examine this question using sequence data from 13 serengeti' strains including five complete genomes obtained between 1993 and 2011. phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses reveal that strains from noncanids during the epidemic were more closely related to each other than to those from domestic or wild canids. all noncanid serengeti' strains during the epidemic encoded: (1) one novel substitution g134s in the cdv-v protein; and (2) therare amino acid combination 519i/549h at two sites under positive selection in the region of the cdv-h protein that binds to slam (cd 150) host cell receptors. worldwide, only a few noncanid strains in the america ii lineage encode cdv-h 519i/549h. all canid serengeti' strains during the epidemic coded cdv-v 134g, and cdv-h 519r/549y, or 519r/549h. a functional assay of cell entry revealed the highest performance by cdv-h proteins encoding 519i/549h in cells expressing lion slam receptors, and the highest performance by proteins encoding 519r/549y, typical of dog strains worldwide, in cells expressing dog slam receptors. our findings are consistent with an epidemic in lions and hyaenas caused by cdv variants better adapted to noncanids than canids, but not with the recent spillover of a dog strain. our study reveals a greater complexity of cdv molecular epidemiology in multihost environments than previously thought.
fluid_mechanics	under investigation in this paper is a fifth-order korteweg de vries type (fkdv-type) equation with time-dependent coefficients, which can be used to describe many nonlinear phenomena in fluid mechanics, ocean dynamics and plasma physics. the binary bell polynomials are employed to find its hirota 's bilinear formalism with an extra auxiliary variable, based on which its n-soliton solutions can be also directly derived. furthermore, by considering multi-dimensional riemann theta function, a lucid and straightforward generalization of the hirota riemann method is presented to explicitly construct the multiperiodic wave solutions of the equation. finally, the asymptotic properties of these periodic wave solutions are strictly analyzed to reveal the relationships between periodic wave solutions and soliton solutions.
southern_blotting	spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (sca31) is defined by the presence of an insertion mutation containing a tggaa repeat within the intron of the brain-expressed, associated with nedd4 (bean) gene. detecting this mutation is conventionally done by southern blotting or dna sequencing, but these methods are technically demanding and not easily implemented in clinical diagnosis. here, we adapted repeat-primed pcr (rp-pcr) to develop a clinical genetic test for sca31 using only the pcr process to detect the tggaa repeat within the insertion mutation. pentanucleotide rp-pcr and subsequent dna fragment analysis demonstrated characteristic ladder peaks with a 5-bp periodicity, originating from the tggaa repeat, in 100% of samples (n = 14) from sca31 patients in whom the presence of the tggaa repeat had been verified by dna sequencing. no peaks were observed in a normal control and two non-sca31 patients, in whom the tggaa repeat was absent. this method is valuable for genetic diagnosis of sca31 in clinical practice. journal of human genetics (2012) 57, 807-808; doi:10.1038/jhg.2012.112; published online 20 september 2012
molecular_biology	background: hpv-16 modifies the overall survival (os) of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (opscc). hpv-16 has been established as risk factor for opscc, but hpv-16 infection may also reside in the larynx and oral cavity. we evaluated hpv-16 status on os of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) patients. methods: hpv-16 infection was confirmed by amplification of e6 and e7 viral oncogenes through pcr assay and e6 ihc in 185 hnscc samples. associations between hpv-16 status and clinicopathological parameters were performed using fisher 's exact test and x(2). survival analysis was completed using kaplan-meier estimator and multivariate cox regression analysis. results: os of hpv-16 positive patients was longer compared to hpv-16 negative patients (p = 0.002). hpv-16 positive tumors of the larynx (lscc) and pharynx (pscc) showed improved os compared to hpv-16 negative tumors. also, hpv-16 positive patients exposed to radiotherapy presented a better survival. conclusions: hpv-16 status has a positive prognostic value in hnscc. addition of hpv-16 status to the tnm staging can provide better assessment in prognosis and guide treatment for hnscc patients.
immunology	the objective of this study was to assess the immune and stress responsiveness of cows identified as extremely high and low feed conversion efficiency phenotypes. the study utilised 16 holstein-friesian cows in their third to fourth lactation, and identified as having either extremely high (n = 8) or extremely low (n = 8) feed conversion efficiency. a commercial vaccine was used to induce measurable antibody-and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses and assess general immune responsiveness. stress responsiveness was assessed by measuring changes in plasma cortisol concentrations in response to yarding and handling. no significant differences in antibody-or cell-mediated immune responsiveness were observed between the extreme high and low feed conversion efficiency phenotypes (p = 0.343 and 0.546, respectively). however, results suggested that plasma cortisol concentrations trended higher in the low feed conversion efficiency phenotype cows than their high feed conversion efficiency counterparts (p = 0.079) 48 h post-yarding and handling. a significant negative correlation was observed between antibody-mediated immune responsiveness and stress responsiveness (r = -0.44, p = 0.043) but not with cell-mediated immune responsiveness (r = 0.135, p = 0.309). this study provides preliminary evidence that cows selected for feed conversion efficiency may have improved stress-coping abilities and immune responsiveness.
southern_blotting	background: hyperthermia plays an important role in cancer therapy. however, as with radiation, it can cause dna damage and therefore genetic instability. we studied whether hyperthermia can induce gene amplification in cancer cells and explored potential underlying molecular mechanisms. materials and methods: (1) hyperthermia: hct116 colon cancer cells received water-submerged heating treatment at 42 or 44 degrees c for 30 min; (2) gene amplification assay using n-(phosphoacetyl)-l-aspartate (pala) selection of cabamyl-p-synthetase, aspartate transcarbarmylase, dihydro-orotase (cad) gene amplified cells; (3) southern blotting for confirmation of increased cad gene copies in pala-resistant cells; (4) gamma h2ax immunostaining to detect gamma h2ax foci as an indication for dna double strand breaks. results: (1) heat exposure at 42 or 44 degrees c for 30 min induces gene amplification. the frequency of cad gene amplification increased by 2.8 and 6.5 folds respectively; (2) heat exposure at both 42 and 44 degrees c for 30 min induces dna double strand breaks in hct116 cells as shown by gamma h2ax immunostaining. conclusion: this study shows that heat exposure can induce gene amplification in cancer cells, likely through the generation of dna double strand breaks, which are believed to be required for the initiation of gene amplification. this process may be promoted by heat when cellular proteins that are responsible for checkpoints, dna replication, dna repair and telomere functions are denatured. to our knowledge, this is the first study to provide direct evidence of hyperthermia induced gene amplification.

molecular_biology	when living organisms independently invade a new environment, the evolution of similar phenotypic traits is often observed. an interesting but contentious issue is whether the underlying molecular biology also converges in the new habitat. independent invasions of tropical intertidal zones by woody plants, collectively referred to as mangrove trees, represent some dramatic examples. the high salinity, hypoxia, and other stressors in the new habitatmight have affected both genomic features and protein structures. here, we developed a new method for detecting convergence at conservative sites (ccs) and applied it to the genomic sequences of mangroves. in simulations, the ccs method drastically reduces random convergence at rapidly evolving sites as well as falsely inferred convergence caused by the misinferences of the ancestral character. in mangrove genomes, we estimated similar to 400 genes that have experienced convergence over the background level of convergence in the nonmangrove relatives. the convergent genes are enriched in pathways related to stress response and embryo development, which could be important for mangroves' adaptation to the new habitat.
enzymology	halogenated pyrroles (halopyrroles) are common chemical moieties found in bioactive bacterial natural products. the halopyrrole moieties of mono-and dihalopyrrole-containing compounds arise from a conserved mechanism in which a proline-derived pyrrolyl group bound to a carrier protein is first halogenated and then elaborated by peptidic or polyketide extensions. this paradigm is broken during the marine pseudoalteromonad bacterial biosynthesis of the coral larval settlement cue tetrabromopyrrole (1), which arises from the substitution of the proline-derived carboxylate by a bromine atom. to understand the molecular basis for decarboxylative bromination in the biosynthesis of 1, we sequenced two pseudoalteromonas genomes and identified a conserved four-gene locus encoding the enzymes involved in its complete biosynthesis. through total in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis of 1 using purified enzymes and biochemical interrogation of individual biochemical steps, we show that all four bromine atoms in 1 are installed by the action of a single flavin-dependent halogenase: bmp2. tetrabromination of the pyrrole induces a thioesterase-mediated offloading reaction from the carrier protein and activates the biosynthetic intermediate for decarboxylation. insights into the tetrabrominating activity of bmp2 were obtained from the high-resolution crystal structure of the halogenase contrasted against structurally homologous halogenase mpy16 that forms only a dihalogenated pyrrole in marinopyrrole biosynthesis. structure-guided mutagenesis of the proposed substrate- binding pocket of bmp2 led to a reduction in the degree of halogenation catalyzed. our study provides a biogenetic basis for the biosynthesis of 1 and sets a firm foundation for querying the biosynthetic potential for the production of 1 in marine (meta) genomes.
northern_blotting	the study of microrna (mirna), a component of low molecular weight rna (lmw rna), has received increasing attention in recent years. a critical prerequisite in mirna studies is acquisition of high quality lmw rna. lmw rna is generally obtained from total rna or from total nucleic acids solutions. most traditional methods for lmw rna isolation involve many steps and chemical reagents which upon degradation may negatively affect results. we employed a simple and quick method involving trizol for total rna extraction from citrus tissues, then generation of lmw rna using 4m licl, which have been successfully utilized in studies in our laboratory. compared with traditional methods, this method is less expensive and produced high rna yields while avoiding the use of phenol or other toxic reagents. in addition, the entire procedure can be completed within 4 hours with many samples being processed simultaneously. therefore, this is a practical and efficient method for lmw rna extraction from woody fruit crops containing high levels of polysaccharide and polyphenolics. using the extracted lmw rna, mirnas were successfully detected and characterized by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and northern blotting.
immunology	adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to improve their immunogenicity. used for more than 80years, aluminum, the first adjuvant in human vaccines, proved insufficient to develop vaccines that could protect against new challenging pathogens such as hiv and malaria. new adjuvants and new combinations of adjuvants (adjuvant systems) have opened the door to the delivery of improved and new vaccines against re-emerging and difficult pathogens. adjuvant systems concept started through serendipity. the access to new developments in technology, microbiology and immunology have been instrumental for the dicephering of what they do and how they do it. this knowledge opens the door to more rational vaccine design with implications for developing new and better vaccines.
machine_design	biomass for bioproducts and bioenergy can be sourced from multiple sources. there is little information on commercial planting operations for willow biomass crops in north america. the objectives of this study were to evaluate the field capacities of two commercial machines (step and egedal energy planter) planting willow crops in northern new york state, determine the amount and distribution of delays. a study was conducted to evaluate planter activities. the two machines had similar mean field capacities (c-f) ranging from 0.89 to 1.14 ha h(-1). above-average rainfall in the later part of the planting season decreased cf by over 20% for the step planter from 1.14 to 0.91 ha h(-1); largely due to delays in the headlands. approximately 70% of the total delay time associated with the step planter consisted of long-duration delays (>5 min) compared to 35% for the egedal. quality of planting stock was an issue for operations; undersized stems resulted in feeding issues. several potential factors were identified for improved planting operations: loading stems and clearing feeding mechanisms at each turn, improved planting stock and quality control, improving machine design for wet conditions, and improved preparation for in-field repairs. in-field delays should be minimized to reduce demand on the crew and ensure a more uniform crop is established in the field.

molecular_biology	life is so remarkable, and so unlike any other physical system, that it is tempting to attribute special factors to it. physics is founded on the assumption that universal laws and principles underlie all natural phenomena, but is it far from clear that there are 'laws of life' with serious descriptive or predictive power analogous to the laws of physics. nor is there (yet) a 'theoretical biology' in the same sense as theoretical physics. part of the obstacle in developing a universal theory of biological organization concerns the daunting complexity of living organisms. however, many attempts have been made to glimpse simplicity lurking within this complexity, and to capture this simplicity mathematically. in this paper we review a promising new line of inquiry to bring coherence and order to the realm of biology by focusing on 'information' as a unifying concept.
polymerase_chain_reaction	caspian horse, a rare horse breed found in 1965 by louise firouz in northern iran, is a small horse which is reported to be in danger of extinction in its original homeland. there seems to be a great need to prevent extinction of this valuable horse. in this study, 51 fibroblast cell lines from caspian horse ear marginal tissue were successfully established by sampling 60 horses using primary explant technique. cells were authenticated and growth curve was plotted. according to results obtained, population doubling time (pdt) was calculated 23 +/- 0.5 h for all cell lines. multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex pcr) revealed that cell lines had no cross-contamination with other species. bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma contamination were checked using standard methods such as pcr, direct culture, and hoechst staining. in addition to providing a valuable source for genomic, postgenomic, and somatic cloning researches, the established cell lines would preserve caspian horse genetic resources. it will also create an accessible database for researchers.
enzymology	background: recently, the concept of recurrent implantation failure (rif) in assisted reproductive technology has been enlarged. chronic uterine inflammation is a known cause of implantation failure and is associated with high matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activity in uterine cavity flushing. mmp activity of women with rif has been reported to be higher than that of fertile women. in the present retrospective study we evaluated the efficacy of treatment for high mmp activity in the uterine cavity of patients with rif. methods: of the 597 patients recruited to the study, 360 patients underwent mmp measurements and 237 patients did not (control group). all patients had failed to become pregnant, despite at least two transfers of good-quality embryos. gelatinase mmp-2 and mmp-9 activity in uterine flushing fluid was detected by enzymology (mmp test). all samples were classified into two groups (positive or negative) based on the intensity of the bands on the enzyme zymogram, which represents the degree of mmp activity. patients who tested positive on the initial test were treated for 2 weeks with a quinolone antibiotic and a corticosteroid, and subsequently underwent a second mmp test. negative results on the second mmp tests after treatment and subsequent rates of pregnancy and miscarriage were used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. data were analyzed by the mann-whitney u-test and the chi-square test. results: of the patients who underwent the mmp test, 15.6% had positive results (high mmp activity). after treatment, 89.3% of patients had negative results on the second mmp test. these patients had a significantly better pregnancy rate (42.0%) than the control group (26.6%), as well as a lower miscarriage rate (28.5% vs 36.5%, respectively). conclusions: a 2-week course of antibiotics and corticosteroids effectively improves the uterine environment underlying rif by reducing mmp activity.
hydraulics	previous thermohydraulic studies performed for the iter tf, cs and pf magnet systems have brought some important information on the detection and consequences of a quench as a function of the initial conditions (deposited energy, heated length). even if the temperature margin of the correction coils is high, their behavior during a quench should also be studied since a quench is likely to be triggered by potential anomalies in joints, ground fault on the instrumentation wires, etc. a model has been developed with the supermagnet code (bagnasco et al., 2010) for a side correction coil (scc2) with four pancakes cooled in parallel, each of them represented by a thea module (with the proper cable in conduit conductor characteristics). all the other coils of the pf cooling loop are hydraulically connected in parallel (top/bottom correction coils and six poloidal field coils) are modeled by flower modules with equivalent hydraulics properties. the model and the analysis results are presented for five quench initiation cases with/without fast discharge: two quenches initiated by a heat input to the innermost turn of one pancake (case 1 and case 2) and two other quenches initiated at the innermost turns of four pancakes (case 3 and case 4). in the 5th case, the quench is initiated at the middle turn of one pancake. the impact on the cooling circuit, e.g. the exceedance of the opening pressure of the quench relief valves, is detailed in case of an undetected quench (i.e. no discharge of the magnet). particular attention is also paid to a possible secondary quench detection system based on measured thermohydraulic signals (pressure, temperature and/or helium mass flow rate). the maximum cable temperature achieved in case of a fast current discharge (primary detection by voltage) is compared to the design hot spot criterion of 150 k, which includes the contribution of helium and jacket.

computer-aided_design	this article describes the computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (cad/cam) accuracy of dental drill guides for application in guided surgery. today, the availability of three-dimensional (3d) desktop printers allows for the cost-effective production of drill guides by dental laboratories. our investigations show the accuracy of produced guides by eliminating influencing factors that exist in the guided surgery workflow. to investigate this accuracy, a method was developed to evaluate the cad/cam production technology apart from sources of error from cone beam computed tomography (cbct) scans, intraoral scans, software or human error. by using a cad/cam-milled idealized reference model, as well as cad data from a scanned dental model with integrated reference spheres, drill guides with different offset values were designed using the codiagnostix r implant-planning software. the bone level roxolid r slactive r implant system (length 8 mm, diameter 3.3 mm) was chosen. the virtual position in relation to both the drill guide and the reference model was determined based on the planning data and exported stl files, respectively. virtual and physical measurements were performed through the center coordinates of the used drill sleeves (t-sleeve: 5 mm), by applying a defined reference coordinate system (rcs) of the dental model. drill guide templates were printed using a fotodent r guide on a dental desktop printer (d30), based on a defined digital workflow. after insertion of the respective drill sleeves, surgical guides were secured on the reference models using quadrangular fixation, thus allowing a tactile measurement by applying a coordinate measurement device for determination of physical position relation. through the central points of the drill sleeves, both the coronal and apical points of the planned implant drilling as well as angular deviation were calculated and reviewed against the cad measurements. on average, a deviation of 0.25 degrees of the planned implant was detected.
enzymology	proline is not only an essential component of proteins but it also has important roles in adaptation to osmotic and dehydration stresses, redox control, and apoptosis. here, we review pathways of proline biosynthesis in the three domains of life. pathway reconstruction from genome data for hundreds of eubacterial and dozens of archaeal and eukaryotic organisms revealed evolutionary conservation and variations of this pathway across different taxa. in the most prevalent pathway of proline synthesis, glutamate is phosphorylated to -glutamyl phosphate by -glutamyl kinase, reduced to -glutamyl semialdehyde by -glutamyl phosphate reductase, cyclized spontaneously to (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate and reduced to proline by (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. in higher plants and animals the first two steps are catalysed by a bi-functional (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. alternative pathways of proline formation use the initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway to ornithine, which can be converted to (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate by ornithine aminotransferase and then reduced to proline or converted directly to proline by ornithine cyclodeaminase. in some organisms, the latter pathways contribute to or could be fully responsible for the synthesis of proline. the conservation of proline biosynthetic enzymes and significance of specific residues for catalytic activity and allosteric regulation are analysed on the basis of protein structural data, multiple sequence alignments, and mutant studies, providing novel insights into proline biosynthesis in organisms. we also discuss the transcriptional control of the proline biosynthetic genes in bacteria and plants.
molecular_biology	endoribonuclease (nendou) is unique and conserved as a major genetic marker in nidoviruses that infect vertebrate hosts. arterivirus nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) was shown to have nendou activity and play essential roles in the viral life cycle. here, we report three crystal structures of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and equine arteritis virus (eav) nsp11 mutants. the structures of arterivirus nsp11 contain two conserved compact domains: the n-terminal domain (ntd) and c-terminal domain (ctd). the structures of prrsv and eav endoribonucleases are similar and conserved in the arterivirus, but they are greatly different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronaviruses (cov), representing important human pathogens in the nidovirales order. the catalytic center of nendou activity is located in the ctd, where a positively charged groove is next to the key catalytic residues conserved in nidoviruses. although the ntd is nearly identical, the catalytic region of the arterivirus nsp11 family proteins is remarkably flexible, and the oligomerization may be concentration dependent. in summary, our structures provide new insight into this key multifunctional nendou family of proteins and lay a foundation for better understanding of the molecular mechanism and antiviral drug development. importance porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and equine arteritis virus are two major members of the arterivirus family. prrsv, a leading swine pathogen, causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. due to the lack of a suitable vaccine or effective drug treatment and the quick spread of these viruses, infected animals either die quickly or must be culled. prrsv costs the swine industry around $ 644 million annually in the united states and almost (sic)1.5 billion in europe every year. to find a way to combat these viruses, we focused on the essential viral nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11). nsp11 is associated with multiple functions, such as rna processing and suppression of the infected host innate immunity system. the three structures solved in this study provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of this crucial protein family and will benefit the development of new treatments against these deadly viruses.
genetics	among the four different types of thyroid cancer, treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma poses a major challenge because of its propensity of early metastasis. to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of medullary thyroid carcinoma and discover candidates for targeted therapies, we developed a new mouse model of medullary thyroid carcinoma based on our cgrp(creer) mouse line. this system enables gene manipulation in parafollicular c cells in the thyroid, the purported cells of origin of medullary thyroid carcinoma. selective inactivation of tumor suppressors, such as p53, rb, and pten, in mature parafollicular c cells via an inducible cre recombinase from cgrp(creer) led to development of murine medullary thyroid carcinoma. loss of pten accelerated p53/rb-induced medullary thyroid carcinoma, indicating interactions between pathways controlled by tumor suppressors. moreover, labeling differentiated parafollicular c cells by cgrp(creer) allows us to follow their fate during malignant transformation to medullary thyroid tumor. our findings support a model in which mutational events in differentiated parafollicular c cells result in medullary thyroid carcinoma. through expression analysis including rna-seq, we uncovered major signaling pathways and networks that are perturbed following the removal of tumor suppressors. taken together, these studies not only increase our molecular understanding of medullary thyroid carcinoma but also offer new candidates for designing targeted therapies or other treatment modalities.
hydraulics	the north-eastern region of india, although rich in land and water resources, often suffers from a water-scarce situation particularly during the non-rainy season. the steep terrain conditions do not support conventional irrigation systems and therefore micro-irrigation system needs to be promoted. in micro-irrigation systems, maintaining uniformity of application is necessary to achieve a satisfactory crop yield. maintaining the system hydraulics is a challenge due to the terrain conditions and equipment available. a study was conducted to observe various uniformity parameters of selected emitters at five different operating pressures, viz. 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 kg cm(-2). in the study it was observed that the discharge variation of the selected emitters was between 8.7 and 39.7%. the uniformity coefficient varied from 0.9 to 16.6, where the distribution uniformity and statistical uniformity varied from 81.1 to 99.1% and 83.4-99.1% respectively. the emitter flow variation ranged from 0.03 to 0.49 in the range of 0.51.5 kg cm(-2). the emitter exponent indicated that the values ranged from 0.20 to 0.55. all these values were far from the manufacturer 's value. from the study we can interpret that the emitting system needs to be tested before adoption in the field to ensure uniformity of water application. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
northern_blotting	the enzyme squalene synthase (ec 2.5.1.21) catalyzes a reductive dimerization of two farnesyl diphosphate (fpp) molecules into squalene, a key precursor for the sterol and triterpene biosynthesis. a full-length cdna encoding squalene synthase (designated as tesqs) was isolated from taxus cuspidata, a kind of important medicinal plants producing potent anti-cancer drug, taxol. the full-length cdna of tcsqs was 1765 bp and contained a 1230 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a polypeptide of 409 amino acids. bioinformatic analysis revealed that the deduced tcsqs protein had high similarity with other plant squalene synthases and a predicted crystal structure similar to other class i isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes. southern blot analysis revealed that there was one copy of tcsqs gene in the genome of t cuspidata. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis and northern blotting analysis showed that tcsqs expressed constitutively in all tested tissues, with the highest expression in roots. the promoter region of tcsqs was also isolated by genomic walking and analysis showed that several cis-acting elements were present in the promoter region. the results of treatment experiments by different signaling components including methyl-jasmonate, salicylic acid and gibberellin revealed that the tesqs expression level of treated cells had a prominent diversity to that of control, which was consistent with the prediction results of tcsqs promoter region in the plantcar-e database.
human_metabolism	whereas selenium (se) is an important antioxidant in human metabolism to prevent cancer, aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic. brazil nuts from eastern and western amazon regions were evaluated to find any relationship between se and aflatoxins levels. a total of 80 (in-shell and shelled) nuts samples were collected directly from different forest sites and analyzed for se by atomic emission spectrometry and aflatoxins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. the limit of quantitation (loq) for se was 2.0 mg/kg, and loq for total aflatoxins was 0.390 mu g/kg. nut se levels from the eastern region were higher than the western, in addition to the aflatoxins. the moisture content (mc) and water activity (a(w)) of the raw nuts from the two regions did not present a significant difference, for either in-shell or shelled. the mc was 24.5% (minimum of 20.1% and maximum of 30.4%) and 22.1% (minimum of 14.6% and maximum of 28.9%) and a(w) of 0.85 for both regions. further studies need to be carried out to discover the role of se on fungi growth stress and aflatoxin production mechanisms.
thermodynamics	a new model for interface problems with capillary effects in compressible fluids is presented together with a specific numerical method to treat capillary flows and pressure waves propagation. this new multiphase model is in agreement with physical principles of conservation and respects the second law of thermodynamics. a new numerical method is also proposed where the global system of equations is split into several submodels. each submodel is hyperbolic or weakly hyperbolic and can be solved with an adequate numerical method. this method is tested and validated thanks to comparisons with analytical solutions (laplace law) and with experimental results on droplet breakup induced by a shock wave.

manufacturing_engineering	the purpose of this study is to investigate the shock attenuation properties of long pile synthetic turf. to investigate these properties using a modeling and simulation method, an appropriate model based on reliable data and a precise identification method is required. in previous studies, unstable data were often observed because uneven top yarns had sprouted from the infill material. therefore, the properties of the infill part, buried yarns and infill materials should be considered first, because sprouted yarn causes unstable shock attenuation. for this reason, special construction specimens with different hardness levels and which had almost no sprouted yarn were prepared, and multi-intensity multi-area impact tests and parameter identification were performed for each specimen. the results show that stable data could be acquired for parameter identification, and the findings indicate the applicability of the modeling and simulation method for evaluating the shock attenuation properties of long pile synthetic turf.

internal_combustion_engine	the selective catalytic reduction (scr) of nitrogen dioxide in an air flow modeling the exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine is studied. granulated v2o5 (13.5%)-mno2 (0.7-1.0%)/al2o3 powder (avk-10m catalyst) and ammonia injected into a scr catalytic cell are used as a heterogeneous catalyst of no2 reduction and a reducing agent, respectively. if the efficiency of no2 removal is high enough and satisfies the requirements of the state sanitary standards for the maximum permissible concentrations of substances emitted into the atmosphere ( = 0.085 mg/m(3)), the reducing agent (ammonia) is not completely consumed during scr, so a considerable amount of nh3 can be released into the atmosphere. therefore, a strict control of both no2 and unreacted ammonia emissions is needed. the dependences of the concentrations of [nh3] and [no2] on the [nh3]/[no2] ratio for the model air flow passed through the avk-10m granular heterogeneous catalyst are measured. it is found that the maximum degree of removal of no2 from the air takes place at [nh3]/[no2] = 1.3. in the conventional process, the concentration of [no2] drop from 530.00 to 0.07 mg/m(3), i.e., below the . at the same time, the ammonia concentration increases to [nh3] = 3.4 mg/m(3), which becomes 85 times the , 0.04 mg/m(3). to remove unreacted ammonia from air flows, we developed [p-(so3 (-))(2) center dot me2+] sulfocationites, where me are the cu and/or ca ions, p is a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer. it is shown that the concentration of ammonia passed through the adsorption cell filled with a freshly sulfocationite drops below = 0.04 mg/m(3). the dependences of the dynamic exchange capacity (dec) before ammonia breakthrough for the [p-(so3 (-))(2) center dot cu2+] delta-sulfocationite on the air flow rate, [nh3] concentration, and humidity are measured. the maximum value of the dec, delta = 59.5 mg/cm(3), is observed at an air flow velocity of 2.171 m/s, [nh3] = 0.0035 mg/l, and 75% humidity. to illustrate practical applications of the proposed improved scr method, it is shown that a 3-l replaceable [p-(so3 (-))(2) center dot cu2+] sorbent cartridge in a scr exhaust gas purifier for a car internal combustion engine does not need replacement more frequently than every 50000 km.
immunology	background: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) capsule enables evasion from phagocytosis, invasion of keratinocytes, and bacterial survival. in mixed infection, the capsule also participates in coaggregation, which may lead to characteristic virulence not present in the monoinfection. the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pg capsule as a virulence factor in coaggregated mixed infection with fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). methods: mixed infections containing fn and non-capsulated or capsulated strains of pg were compared with the same infection with lactose as coaggregation inhibitor. murine experimental periodontitis was used to assess disease severity. primary polymorphonuclear leukocytes and keratinocytes were used to examine phagocytosis and bacterial invasion, respectively. results: mixed infection with capsulated pg augmented alveolar bone loss compared with that of mixed infection with non-capsulated pg. addition of lactose led to attenuation of bone loss in the capsulated mixed infection and to intensification of bone loss in the non-capsulated mixed infection. in the latter mixed infection, fn evaded phagocytosis, whereas in the capsulated mixed infection pg displayed a greater capacity for invasion of keratinocytes. conclusions: pg capsule was found to serve as a unique virulence factor in mixed infection with fn. capsule-dependent coaggregation led to augmented invasion of pg and may be responsible for the severity of disease after mixed infection with fn.
computer-aided_design	an engineering design process consists of a sequence of creative, innovative and routine design tasks. routine tasks address well-known procedures and add limited value to the technical improvement of a product. even if they may require a lot of work. in order to focus designers work on added value tasks, the present work aims at supporting a routine task with a design archetype (da). a da captures, stores and reuses the design knowledge with a tool embedded in a cad software. the da algorithms drive the designer in selecting the most effective design concept to deliver the project requirements and then embody the concept through configuring a cad model. finally, a case study on the definition of a da tool for gear design demonstrates the effectiveness of the da tool.
northern_blotting	the cdna amphiarf , encoding a novel member of arf family was for the first time identified from the gut cdna library of amphioxus branchiostoma becheri tsingtauense . the deduced amino acid sequence includes the motifs involved in gtp binding (dvgg, nkqd and sak) and hydrolysis (gxdxxgk), and a glycine at position 2 for n-terminal myristoylation, which are all characteristic of arfs. however, it has a 46 amino acid c-terminal extension (positions 183-227), which was not found in any arf family previously described including arf-like proteins. this suggests that amphiarf is a new member of arf family, which was also supported by the phylogenetic analysis. it is highly likely that the extended c-terminal of amphiarf is a novel addition occurring after cephalochordate/vertebrate split. northern blotting analysis revealed that amphiarf transcript was present in all tissues examined, consistent with the involvement of arfs in the fundamental role like vesicular trafficking of proteins.
northern_blotting	manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) plays an important role in crustacean immune defense reaction by eliminating oxidative stress. knowledge on mnsod at molecular level allows us to understand its regulatory mechanism in crustacean immune system. a novel mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (mmnsod) was cloned from hepatopancreas of chinese shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis by 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) pcr. the full-length cdna consists of 1185 bp with a 660 bp open reading frame, encoding 220 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal peptide of 20 amino acids. sequence comparison showed that the mmnsod of f. chinensis shares 88% and 82% identity with that of giant freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii and blue crab callinectes sapidus, respectively. mmnsod transcripts were detected in hepatopancreas, hemocytes, lymphoid organ, intestine, ovary, muscle and gill by northern blotting. rt-pcr analysis indicated that mmnsod showed different expression profiles in shrimp hemocytes and hepatopancreas after artificial infection with while spot syndrome virus (wssv). in addition, a fusion protein containing mmnsod was produced in vitro. lc-esi-ms analysis showed that two peptide fragments (-gdvntvislapalk- and -nvrpdyvnaiwk-) of the recombinant protein were identical to the corresponding sequence of m. rosenbergii mmnsod, and the enzyme activity of the refolded recombinant protein was also measured.

molecular_biology	brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and its tyrosine kinase receptor trkb have been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma (nb) patients. our previous studies indicated that bdnf activation of trkb induces chemo-resistance through activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (pi3k)/akt pathway. in this study, we investigated the role of bdnf/trkb on metastasis in nb. a tetracycline-regulated trkb-expressing nb cell line (tb3) was used. scratch wound healing assay, boyden chamber migration, and invasion assays were performed to study the migration and invasion of tb3 cells. a tumor xenograft model using scid-beige mice was utilized to detect the metastasis of nb tumors in vivo. inhibitors of pi3k, mapk, akt, and mtor were used. western blotting was performed to study the expressions of p-akt, p-erk, and p-mtor. our results showed that in trkb-expressing nb cells, bdnf treatment significantly increased gap closing (p < 0.01) in scratch wound healing assay, also significantly enhanced the numbers of migrating cells (p < 0.01) and invading cells (p < 0.01) in the boyden chamber migration and invasion assays. in vivo, nb distant metastases were significantly increased in mice with trkb-expressing xenograft tumors compared to those with non-trkb-expressing tumors (p < 0.05). pre-treatment with any of the inhibitors for pi3k (ly294002), mapk (pd98059), akt (perifosine), or mtor (rapamycin) blocked the bdnf/trkb-induced increases of cell migration and invasion in tb3 cells, and also blocked the bdnf/trkb-induced expressions of p-akt, p-erk, and p-mtor. these data indicated that bdnf/trkb increased metastasis in nb via pi3k/akt/mtor and mapk pathways, and bdnf/trkb and the downstream targets may be potential targets for the treatment of nb metastasis.
northern_blotting	riboswitches are cis-acting mrna elements that regulate gene expression in response to ligand binding. recently, a class of riboswitches was proposed to respond to the molybdenum cofactor (moco), which serves as a redox center for metabolic enzymes. the 5' leader of the escherichia coli moaabcde transcript exemplifies this candidate riboswitch class. this mrna encodes enzymes for moco biosynthesis, and moaa expression is feedback inhibited by moco. previous rna-seq analyses showed that moaa mrna copurified with the rna binding protein csra (carbon storage regulator), suggesting that csra binds to this rna in vivo. among its global regulatory roles, csra represses stationary phase metabolism and activates central carbon metabolism. here, we used gel mobility shift analysis to determine that csra binds specifically and with high affinity to the moaa 5' mrna leader. northern blotting and studies with a series of chromosomal lacz reporter fusions showed that csra posttranscriptionally activates moaa expression without altering moaa mrna levels, indicative of translation control. deletion analyses, nucleotide replacement studies and footprinting with csra-febabe identified two sites for csra binding. toeprinting assays suggested that csra binding causes changes in moaa rna structure. we propose that the moaa mrna leader forms an aptamer, which serves as a target of posttranscriptional regulation by at least two different factors, moco and the protein csra. while we are not aware of similar dual posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, additional examples are likely to emerge.

cell_biology	iq motif containing gtpase activating protein1 (iqgap1) is a scaffold protein, which is aberrantly expressed in several tumor types and is closely associated with the development, metastasis and prognosis of cancer. several studies have demonstrated that iqgap1 has broad prospects in the basic and clinical research of tumors. the present study aimed to explore the effects of iqgap1-small interfering (si) na on the proliferation and metastasis of u251 and u373 glioma cell lines, which markedly expressed iqgap1. the human glioma cell lines (u251 and u373) were transfected with sirna and transfection efficacy was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) and western blot analysis. cell proliferation was detected using the cell counting kit-8, and cell metastasis capabilities were detected using cell adhesion, migration and invasion assays. in addition, the expression levels of several tumor-associated genes were determined by rt-qpcr and western blotting. the results indicated that iqgap1 was expressed at higher levels in glioma tissues compared with in normal brain tissues. iqgap1-sirna significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and cell adhesion, migration and invasion. furthermore, the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)2, snail, mmp9, fibronectin 1 and twist were suppressed, and e-cadherin was upregulated in response to sirna-iqgap1. the present study identified the function of iqgap1 in glioma cell biology, and indicated that it may be considered a novel target for glioma treatment.
thermodynamics	deleuze 's use of thermodynamics in the fifth chapter of his masterwork difference and repetition ushers in perhaps the most crucial notion for understanding this work: intensity. given that the process of actualisation relies on the intensive necessarily means that any discussion of the relationship between the virtual and the actual must include a thorough explanation of the role of intensity, and where exactly this notion sits within the virtual-actual doublet. as such, we must return to the fifth chapter of difference and repetition in order to assess the way in which deleuze conceives of this complex and indispensable cog in his ontological and metaphysical philosophy. in this paper we turn, then, to deleuze 's engagement with the theories of the intensive as found in classical thermodynamic theory. quite simply, deleuze will highlight the way in which the productive force of differences in intensity remains under-appreciated in contrast to the extensive states they create in this classical framework. we can understand this engagement, then, as an example of the way in which the extensive is continually privileged over the intensive. in this paper we will outline the details of the engagement between deleuze and thermodynamics, as this paves the way for his own philosophy of intensity. furthermore, we will provide a theory of the relationship between intensity, the virtual and the actual as these notions appear in difference and repetition
polymerase_chain_reaction	intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is a lifethreat-ening type of stroke. previous studies have reported that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bmscs) may exert beneficial effects on the treatment of ich. however, it remains unknown whether the neuroprotection exerted by bmscs on ich is due to the differentiation of bmscs, or the trophic factors secreted into their conditioned medium (cm). in addition, growth-associated protein-43 (gap-43) is a protein associated with neurite extension, which may be considered a prospective therapeutic target in the treatment of ich. the present study investigated whether administration of bmsc-cm could be considered as an alternative to the established treatment of direct bmsc transplantation; in addition, the underlying mechanisms were evaluated. neurological function tests, brain water content, reverse transcription -quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used in present study. the current study indicated that the neuroprotective effects of bmsc implantation and bmsc-cm treatment are similar, and that both decrease the severity of post-ich cerebral edema, as well as improving neurological functions. at the molecular level, treatment with bmsc-cm resulted in a marked elevation in the expression of gap-43 and interleukin (il) -10, in addition to a significant reduction in the expression levels of il-1a, tumor necrosis factor-a and il-6. following application of a phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk1/2) inhibitor, pd98059, in a bmsc-cm rat model, the mrna and protein expression levels of gap-43 were significantly attenuated. therefore, the findings of the present study demonstrated that treatment with bmsc-cm may be an alternative to direct bmsc transplantation in a rat model of ich. the mechanism underlying bmsc-cm-mediated neuroprotection may be associated with anti-inflammatory effects, as well as activation of gap-43 transcription and expression through erk-1/2 phosphorylation. therefore, the erk-1/2-gap-43 signaling pathway may be considered a potential novel application target of bmsc-cm for the treatment of neurological diseases.
southern_blotting	the reverse transcriptase (rt) domain of the copia retrotransposons was amplified from genomic dna of an aquatic perennial grass, zizania latifolia (griseb.)-a wild relative of rice. in total, 71 different sequences were obtained, which, according to alignment and phylogenetic analysis, can be classified into seven distinct families, with five each containing multiple sequences and two each containing a single sequence. the nucleotide sequence similarity values varied widely among the sequences, indicative of their high degree of heterogeneity. of the 71 sequences, 25 are intact whereas the others have a frameshift, a stop codon, or both. southern blot analysis revealed differential occurrence of the z. latifolia copia retrotransposons among representative species of the grass family, and upon which three groups (1, 11 and 111) can be divided. an interesting observation is that whereas the occurrence patterns of groups i and 11 among the grass species is compatible with their organismal phylogeny, which of group iii shows apparent incongruity. because cytosine methylation has been proposed as a major mechanism controlling transpositional behavior, amplification, and hence distribution, of mobile elements, the extent and pattern of this epigenetic modification were analyzed for the zizania copia retrotransposons. southern blotting with a pair of isoschizomers, hpall and mspl, with differential sensitivity to cytosine methylation revealed an atypical methylation pattern of the z. latifolia copia retrotransposons. it was found that only two of the seven families (families 1 and 4) showed typical methylation patterns as found in other plants, i.e., cg is more heavily methylated than cng, while the rest five families showed an atypical pattern, i.e., cng is more methylated than cg, which was further verified by using the z. latifolia copia-mixture as a probe. in addition, the homologues of those z. latifolia copia elements that exist in both cultivated rice and the common wild rice are largely undermethylated and highly conserved, though some of which showed evidence for methylation alteration in several rice-zizania introgression lines. thus, the atypical patterns of cytosine methylation of the copia retrotransposons in z. latifolia might have played a role in their differentiation into distinct groups, and differential occurrence of their homologs in other species of the grass family.

genetics	pine pollen dispersal has been well-studied over a century due to its ubiquity, robust shape and unusual longevity; this knowledge can be brought to bear on forest population genetics applications and gene conservation programs for pines and other high-latitude wind-pollinated species. dispersal models are shifting towards meso-scale transport processes so i assert here that this shift in transport scale is important to population genetics assumptions inherent to gene conservation decision-making. support comes from the following: (1) aerodynamic properties for pollen is more akin to spores than seeds. (2) gradient-free dispersal is typical of pollen transported at meso-scale distances. (3) importance of vertically uplifted pollen on meso-scale transport has been overlooked and its interaction with atmospheric processes is not yet understood. (4) a fraction of pine pollen retains its capacity for germination and seed fertilization after meso-scale transport. these findings raise the question of whether forest fragmentation aligns with genetics theory of small populations; this question shapes ex situ and in situ collections. the shift to meso-scale transport of pine pollen can re-shape forest gene conservation decision-making about ex situ and in situ collection strategies.
northern_blotting	background diamond-blackfan anemia and shwachman-diamond syndrome are inherited bone marrow failure syndromes linked to defects in ribosome synthesis. the purpose of this study was to determine whether yeast models for diamond-blackfan anemia and shwachman-diamond syndrome differed in the mechanism by which ribosome synthesis was affected. design and methods northern blotting, pulse-chase analysis, and polysome profiling were used to study ribosome synthesis in yeast models. localization of 60s ribosomal subunits was assessed using rpl25egfp. results relative to wild-type controls, each disease model showed defects in 60s subunit maturation, but with distinct underlying mechanisms. in the model of diamond-blackfan anemia, 60s subunit maturation was disrupted at a relatively early stage with abortive complexes subject to rapid degradation. 5s ribosomal rna, unlike other large subunit ribosomal rna in this model, accumulated as an extra-ribosomal species. in contrast, subunit maturation in the shwachman-diamond syndrome model was affected at a later step, giving rise to relatively stable pre-60s particles with associated 5s ribosomal rna retained in the nucleus. conclusions these differences between the yeast diamond-blackfan anemia and shwactiman-diamond syndrome models have implications for signaling mechanisms linking abortive ribosome. assembly to cell fate decisions and may contribute to the divergent clinical presentations of diamond-blackfan anemia and shwachman-diamond syndrome.
northern_blotting	the oriental leafworm moth, spodoptera litura, is a major agricultural pest in southeast asia and nearby pacific regions. two distinct trehalases have been identified in insects: soluble trehalase (treh1) and membrane-bound trehalase (treh2), although there is currently no information on these genes in s. litura. to characterize the distribution and function of treh, cdnas of treh proteins were cloned from s. litura. spolitreh1 cdna has an open reading frame of 1758 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 585 amino acids, with a predicted mass of approximately 67.07 kda and an isoelectric point of 4.86. spolitreh2 cdna has an open reading frame of 2325 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 645 amino acids, a mass of approximately 73.62 kda, and an isoelectric point of 5.90. northern blotting analysis revealed that spolitreh1 transcripts are in the midgut, fat body, tracheae, and epidermis, but not in the brain and malpighian tubules of s. litura larvae, whereas spolitreh2 transcripts were found in all 6 tissues. spolitreh1 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body the pre-pupal stage, and spolitreh2 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body of 3-day-old larvae of the 6th instar and during the 1st 6 days of the pupal stage, except the 2nd day. both spolitreh1 and spolitreh2 were highly expressed in third-instar larvae.
molecular_biology	background: during the last few years, investigators have debated the role that infectious agents may have in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. with the emergence of new molecular biology techniques, several studies have been conducted; therefore, we performed a meta-analysis in order to better explain this possible association. methods: this review was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) statement from the cochrane collaboration guidelines. four different databases (medline, scopus, web of science, and cochrane collaboration) were searched for all original articles published from 1980 to 2015. the present meta-analysis included case-control studies that reported the presence of microorganisms in samples of patients with sarcoidosis using culture methods or molecular biology techniques. we used a random effects or a fixed-effect model to calculate the odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed in order to explore the heterogeneity among studies. results: fifty-eight studies qualified for the purpose of this analysis. the present meta-analysis, the first, to our knowledge, in evaluation of all infectious agents proposed to be associated with sarcoidosis and involving more than 6000 patients in several countries, suggests an etiological link between propionibacterium acnes and sarcoidosis, with an or of 18.80 (95% ci 12.62, 28.01). we also found a significant association between sarcoidosis and mycobacteria, with an or of 6.8 (95% ci 3.73, 12.39). borrelia (or 4.82; 95% ci 0.98, 23.81), hhv-8 (or 1.47; 95% ci 0.02, 110.06) as well as rickettsia helvetica, chlamydia pneumoniae, epstein-barr virus and retrovirus, although suggested by previous investigations, were not associated with sarcoidosis. conclusion: this meta-analysis suggests that some infectious agents can be associated with sarcoidosis. what seems clear is that more than one infectious agent might be implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis; probably the patient 's geographical location might dictate which microorganisms are more involved. future investigations and more clinical trials are need to bring these evidences to a more global level.
fluid_mechanics	this paper discusses the findings from a measurement campaign on a rotating wind turbine blade operating in the free atmosphere under realistic conditions. a total of 40 pressure sensors together with an array of 23 usable hot-film sensors (based on constant temperature anemometry) were used to study the behavior of the boundary layer within a specific zone on the suction side of a 30m diameter wind turbine at different operational states. a set of several hundreds of data sequences were recorded. some of them show that under certain circumstances, the flow may be regarded as not fully turbulent. accompanying computational fluid mechanics (cfd) simulations suggest the view that a classical transition scenario according to the growth of so-called tollmien-schlichting did not apply. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
computer-aided_design	a semi-empirical approach to model the temperature effects on i-v characteristics of carbon nanotube field effect transistors (cntfets) is proposed. the model includes two thermal parameters describing cntfet behaviour in terms of saturation drain current and threshold voltage, whose values are extracted from the simulated and trans-characteristics of the device in different temperature conditions. our results are compared with those of a numerical model online available, obtaining i-v characteristics comparable but with a lower cpu calculation time.
human_metabolism	levo-tetrahydropalmatine (l-thp) is a tetrahydroprotoberberine isoquinoline alkaloid and has been used as an analgesic agent in china for over 50 years. recent studies revealed that l-thp was effective in the treatment of drug addiction. however, the plasma metabolic profile, mass balance and clearance pathways of l-thp in human remain unknown. in the present study, an analytical strategy was developed for qualitative and quantitative investigation of metabolism and disposition of l-thp in human. detection and structural characterization of l-thp metabolites were performed using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. selected major metabolites in plasma, urine and feces determined by liquid chromatography with uv detection were further quantified using a triple quadruple mass spectrometry and reference standards. a total of 20 metabolites were identified, most of which were formed via demethylation, mono-hydroxylation, and glucuronidation and sulfonation of desmethyl metabolites. five major metabolites accounted for over 10% of the parent drug concentration in plasma. major urinary and fecal metabolites and the parent drug that were monitored for 72 h accounted for 463% of the dose, while only 0.16% of the dose was the unchanged drug. multiple demethylations followed by glucuronide and sulfate conjugations and renal excretion were the major drug clearance pathways of l-thp in human.

enzymology	flavonoids represent a large class of secondary metabolites produced by plants. these polyphenolic compounds are well known for their antioxidative abilities, are antimicrobial phytoalexins responsible for flower pigmentation to attract pollinators and, in addition to other properties, are also specific bacterial regulators governing the expression of rhizobium genes involved in root nodulation (firmin et al., 1986). the bacterial chalcone isomerase (chi) from eubacterium ramulus catalyses the first step in a flavanone-degradation pathway by ring opening of (2s)-naringenin to form naringenin chalcone. the structural biology and enzymology of plant chis have been well documented, whereas the existence of bacterial chis has only recently been elucidated. this first determination of the structure of a bacterial chi provides detailed structural insights into the key step of the flavonoid-degradation pathway. the active site could be confirmed by co-crystallization with the substrate (2s)-naringenin. the stereochemistry of the proposed mechanism of the isomerase reaction was verified by specific h-1/h-2 isotope exchange observed by h-1 nmr experiments and was further supported by mutagenesis studies. the active site is shielded by a flexible lid, the varying structure of which could be modelled in different states of the catalytic cycle using small-angle x-ray scattering data together with the crystallographic structures. comparison of bacterial chi with the plant enzyme from medicago sativa reveals that they have unrelated folds, suggesting that the enzyme activity evolved convergently from different ancestor proteins. despite the lack of any functional relationship, the tertiary structure of the bacterial chi shows similarities to the ferredoxin-like fold of a chlorite dismutase and the stress-related protein sp1.
hydraulics	forward quantification of simulation (code) response uncertainties requires knowledge of physical model parameter uncertainties. nuclear thermal-hydraulics codes, such as relap5 and trace, do not provide any information on uncertainties of physical model parameters. a framework is developed to quantify uncertainties of physical model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation (mle), bayesian maximum a priori (map), and markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) algorithms. the objective of the present work is to perform the sensitivity analysis of the physical model parameters in code trace and calculate their uncertainties using mle, map, and mcmc algorithms. the oecd/nea bwr full-size fine-mesh bundle test (bfbt) data is used to quantify uncertainty of selected physical models of trace code. the bfbt is based on a multi-rod assembly with measured data available for single or two-phase pressure drop, axial and radial void fraction distributions, and critical power for a wide range of system conditions. in this work, the steady-state cross-sectional averaged void fraction distribution is used as the input data for inverse uncertainty quantification (iuq) algorithms, and the selected physical model 's probability distribution function (pdf) is the desired output quantity.

molecular_biology	objective: by primary cultivation of clinical specimens of human cervical cancer, the main and side population cells were isolated and their biological characteristics were analyzed. methods: clinical specimens of human cervical tissue were cultured to get the primary cells. after staining by hoechst33342, flow cytometry was used for sorting to get the main and side population cells. their molecular biology, morphology and tumorigenicity were compared with that of hela cells. results: the primary cervical cancer and side population cells were isolated successfully, and the two cells have obvious tumor cell morphology. ck17, ck19, p63 and beta 1-integrin and other related markers were expressed. tumorigenicity of side population cells was significantly higher than the main group of cells. distribution of the cytoskeleton and expression associated tumor markers were not affected before and after tumorigenesis of the two cells. conclusion: side population cells which were cultured and isolated from clinical specimens of human cervical cancer have the characteristics of tumor stem cell, which can be used for further study of targeted therapy for cervical cancer.
thermodynamics	in einstein-aether theory, violating lorentz invariance permits some super-luminal communications, and the universal horizon can trap excitations traveling at arbitrarily high velocities. to better understand the nature of these universal horizons, we first modify the ray tracing method, and then use it to study their surface gravity in charged einstein-aether black hole spacetime. instead of the previous result by cropp et al., our results show that the surface gravity of the universal horizon is dependent on the specific dispersion relation, kuh = 2(z - 1) k(uh)/z, where z denotes the power of the leading term in the superluminal dispersion relation, characterizing different species of particles. and the associated hawking temperatures also are different with z. these findings, which coincide with those derived by the tunneling method, provide some full understanding of black hole thermodynamics in lorentz-violating theories.
genetics	peroxisomes are thought to have played a key role in the evolution of metabolic networks of photosynthetic organisms by connecting oxidative and biosynthetic routes operating in different compartments. while the various oxidative pathways operating in the peroxisomes of higher plants are fairly well characterized, the reactions present in the primitive peroxisomes ( microbodies) of algae are poorly understood. screening of a chlamydomonas insertional mutant library identified a strain strongly impaired in oil remobilization and defective in cre05.g232002 (cracx2), a gene encoding a member of the acyl-coa oxidase/dehydrogenase superfamily. the purified recombinant cracx2 expressed in escherichia coli catalyzed the oxidation of fatty acyl-coas into trans-2-enoyl-coa and produced h2o2. this result demonstrated that cracx2 is a genuine acyl-coa oxidase, which is responsible for the first step of the peroxisomal fatty acid ( fa) beta-oxidation spiral. a fluorescent protein-tagging study pointed to a peroxisomal location of cracx2. the importance of peroxisomal fa beta-oxidation in algal physiology was shown by the impact of the mutation on fa turnover during day/night cycles. moreover, under nitrogen depletion the mutant accumulated 20% more oil than the wild type, illustrating the potential of beta-oxidation mutants for algal biotechnology. this study provides experimental evidence that a plant-type fa beta-oxidation involving h2o2- producing acyl-coa oxidation activity has already evolved in the microbodies of the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
thermodynamics	the kinetics of solid-liquid extraction of bioactive adenosine and cordycepin from the mycelia of c. sinensis cs1197 was studied. hot water extraction was carried out at temperature 70, 80 and 90 degrees c and ph 3, 4 and 5 and mechanism of extraction was studied by applying fick 's diffusion and empirical models. akaike information criterion (aic) was employed for selection of the best model among candidate models. based on aic, the parabolic diffusion model was found to be the best among competitive models with high r-2 value. diffusion coefficient for adenosine and cordycepin extraction were 1.06 x 10(-12)-2.13 x 10(-12) and 1.06 x 10(-12)-2.85 x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) respectively. thermodynamic analysis of the process revealed that extraction of adenosine and cordycepin is feasible, endothermic and spontaneous at ph 4 and temperature 70 degrees c.

hydraulics	the optimum economic sizing of a water distribution network has been focus of study for many researches and projectors, and represent a relevant part of sanitation programs. but, by now, the known works approaches only the implantation cost, considering that the pipes have biggest heavy in the project. so, the problem is reduced to sizing pipes which objective is reach a cheaper network and satisfying the minimum hydraulic prerequisites. this leads to the choice of a network with pipes of minor diameters since this choice satisfies the hydraulics restrictions. new in brazil by now, our approach consider too the maintenance cost throughout life span of network. it because, if in one way the larger diameters are more expensive, in an other, it are more resistant to break and to rugosity effects. this leads to a network of minimum maintenance cost throughout its life span. then, we reach the equilibrium between the implantation cost and the maintenance cost.
machine_design	electric machines with concentrated winding and single tooth design provide a cost effective way to use flat wires. hereby high filling factors can be achieved, but due to geometric constraints and the influence of current displacements there remains unused space inside the slot. this space can be used for water cooling channels. as a result of the small thermal resistance between winding and cooling fluid this leads to an outstanding cooling performance. compared to round wires efficiency is improved in wide parts of the operating area. the absence of the cooling jacket leads to comparable production costs but an even more compact machine design. technological aspects are discussed and a particular high-power-density interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (ipmsm) with water jacket cooling and round wires is compared to a flat wire wound, slot cooled motor by the use of fem and cfd simulations and measurements on single tooth specimen.
genetics	voltage-gated sodium channels are pore-forming transmembrane proteins that selectively allow sodium ions to flow across the plasma membrane according to the electro-chemical gradient thus mediating the rising phase of action potentials in excitable cells and playing key roles in physiological processes such as neurotransmission, skeletal muscle contraction, heart rhythm, and pain sensation. genetic variations in the nine human genes encoding these channels are known to cause a large range of diseases affecting the nervous and cardiac systems. understanding the molecular effect of genetic variations is critical for elucidating the pathologic mechanisms of known variations and in predicting the effect of newly discovered ones. to this end, we have created a web-based tool, the ion channels variants portal, which compiles all variants characterized functionally in the human sodium channel genes. this portal describes 672 variants each associated with at least one molecular or clinical phenotypic impact, for a total of 4,658 observations extracted from 264 different research articles. these data were captured as structured annotations using standardized vocabularies and ontologies, such as the gene ontology and the ion channel electrophysiology ontology. all these data are available to the scientific community via nextprot at https://www.nextprot.org/portals/navmut.
genetics	background: age-related macular degeneration (amd) is a common condition of vision loss with disease development strongly influenced by environmental and genetic factors. recently, 34 loci were associated with amd at genome-wide significance. so far, little is known about a genetic overlap between amd and other complex diseases or disease-relevant traits. methods: for each of 60 complex diseases/traits with publicly available genome-wide significant association data, the lead genetic variant per independent locus was extracted and a genetic score was calculated for each disease/trait as the weighted sum of risk alleles. the association with amd was estimated based on 16,144 amd cases and 17,832 controls using logistic regression. results: of the respective disease/trait variance, the 60 genetic scores explained on average 4.8% (0.27-20.69%) and 16 of them were found to be significantly associated with amd (q-values < 0.01, p values from < 1.0 x 10(-16) to 1.9 x 10(-3)). notably, an increased risk for amd was associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular diseases, increased risk for autoimmune diseases, higher hdl and lower ldl levels in serum, lower bone-mineral density as well as an increased risk for skin cancer. by restricting the analysis to 1824 variants initially used to compute the 60 genetic scores, we identified 28 novel amd risk variants (q-values < 0.01, p values from 1.1 x 10(-7) to 3.0 x 10(-4)),known to be involved in cardiovascular disorders, lipid metabolism, autoimmune diseases, anthropomorphic traits, ocular disorders, and neurological diseases. the latter variants represent 20 novel amd-associated, pleiotropic loci. genes in the novel loci reinforce previous findings strongly implicating the complement system in amd pathogenesis. conclusions: we demonstrate a substantial overlap of the genetics of several complex diseases/traits with amd and provide statistically significant evidence for an additional 20 loci associated with amd. this highlights the possibility that so far unrelated pathologies may have disease pathways in common.
thermodynamics	a cross-linked polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (poss) nanohybrid is synthesized through schiff base chemistry by using octa-amino poss as building blocks and glutaraldehyde as dual functional reagent. the obtained nanohybrid is characterized by ft-ir, solid-state si-29 nmr, sem, tem, tga and n2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, and the results demonstrate the successful cross-linkage between poss molecules, forming block-like irregular nanoparticles with a specific surface area of 42.8 m(2) g(-1). as a novel solid-phase adsorbent, cross-linked poss nanohybrid exhibits selective adsorption properties for acidic dyes, i.e., methyl orange (mo) in the present case. the strong electrostatic interactions between mo species and the nanohybrid are the main driving forces for mo adsorption. the kinetic data are well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. the adsorption isotherm studies demonstrate that the data are well fit with langmuir model at 293 k and a maximum adsorption capacity of 237.5 mg g(-1) is obtained. thermodynamic studies indicate that the adsorption of mo is spontaneous and exothermal, along with reduced randomness. the adsorbed mo species could be effectively recovered by using methanol/naoh (9/1, viv, 0.1 mol l-1 naoh) as eluent. the practical application for textile wastewater treatment demonstrates that cross-linked poss nanohybrid appears to be a promising material in dye removal field.

fluid_mechanics	we present petiga, a code framework to approximate the solution of partial differential equations using isogeometric analysis. petiga can be used to assemble matrices and vectors which come from a galerkin weak form, discretized with non-uniform rational b-spline basis functions. we base our framework on petsc, a high-performance library for the scalable solution of partial differential equations, which simplifies the development of large-scale scientific codes, provides a rich environment for prototyping, and separates parallelism from algorithm choice. we describe the implementation of petiga, and exemplify its use by solving a model nonlinear problem. to illustrate the robustness and flexibility of petiga, we solve some challenging nonlinear partial differential equations that include problems in both solid and fluid mechanics. we show strong scaling results on up to 4096 cores, which confirm the suitability of petiga for large scale simulations.

cell_biology	treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (aml), an aggressive and heterogeneous hematological malignancy, remains a challenge. despite advances in our understanding of the complex genetics and biology of aml pathophysiology, these findings have been translated to the clinic with only limited success, and poor outcomes persist for the majority of patients. thus, novel treatment strategies are clearly needed for achieving deeper and prolonged remissions and for avoiding the development of resistance. due to its profound role in (cancer) stem cell biology and differentiation, the hedgehog (hh)/glioma-associated oncogene homolog (gli) signaling pathway may be an attractive novel therapeutic target in aml. in this review, we aim to provide a critical and concise overview of the currently known potential and challenges of hh/gli targeting. we describe the biological role of the hh/gli pathway in aml pathophysiology. we specifically focus on ways of targeting non-canonical hh/gli signaling in aml, particularly in combination with standard treatment regimens, which may overcome some hurdles observed with approved hh pathway inhibitors in solid tumors.
cell_biology	a novel animal model involving chimeric mice with humanized livers established via human hepatocyte transplantation has been developed. these mice, in which the liver has been repopulated with functional human hepatocytes, could serve as a useful tool for investigating human hepatic cell biology, drug metabolism, and other preclinical applications. one of the key factors required for successful transplantation of human hepatocytes into mice is the elimination of the endogenous hepatocytes to prevent competition with the human cells and provide a suitable space and microenvironment for promoting human donor cell expansion and differentiation. to date, two major liver injury mouse models utilizing fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (fah) and uroplasminogen activator (upa) mice have been established. however, fah mice are used mainly with mature hepatocytes and the application of the upa model is limited by decreased breeding. to overcome these limitations, albtoxin receptor mediated cell knockout (treck)/scid mice were used for in vivo differentiation of immature human hepatocytes and humanized liver generation. human hepatic stem cells (hpscs) successfully repopulated the livers of alb-treck/scid mice that had developed lethal fulminant hepatic failure following diphtheria toxin (dt) treatment. this model of a humanized liver in alb-treck/scid mice will have functional applications in studies involving drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions and will promote other in vivo and in vitro studies.
human_metabolism	di-iso-nonylphthalate (dinp), a complex mixture of predominantly nine-carbon branched chain dialkyl phthalate isomers, has replaced di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (dehp) as the major plasticiser for polyvinylchloride (pvc) polymers. similar to dehp, dinp is a developmental and reproductive toxicant in rodents. this study for the first time describes human metabolism and elimination of dinp in a male volunteer after we applied a single oral dinp dose of 1.27 mg/kg body-weight. to avoid interference by omnipresent background exposure we used deuterium-labelled dinp. we investigated the urinary excretion of the simple monoester mono-iso-nonylphthalate (minp) and oxidised isomers with hydroxy (oh-minp), oxo (oxo-minp) and carboxy (carboxy-minp) functional groups. we used isomeric minp and three specific oxidised isomer standards for quantification: mono-(4-methyl-7-hydroxy-octyl)phthalate (70h-mmeop), mono-(4-methyl-7-oxo-octyl)phtalate (7oxo-mmeop) and rnono-(4-methyl-7-carboxyheptyl)phthalate (7carboxy-mmehp). these specific dinp metabolites are currently the only synthetic dinp metabolite standards available. within 48 h we recovered 43.6% of the applied dose in urine as the above dinp metabolites, 20.2% as oh-minp, 10.7% as carboxy-minp, 10.6% as oxo-minp and only 2.2% as minp. other oxidised dinp metabolites not determined in this study probably increase the share of the dinp dose excreted via urine. elimination followed a multi-phase pattern, elimiation half-lives in the second phase (beginning 2411 post-dose) can only roughly be estimated to be 12h for the oh- and oxo-mnp-metabolites and 18h for carboxy-minp metabolites. after 24h, the carboxy-minp metabolites replaced the oh-minp metabolites as the major urinary metabolites. all oxidised dinp metabolites are suitable parameters for biomonitoring human dinp exposure.

internal_combustion_engine	in this study, the experiments aimed at analyzing thermally the exhaust valve in an air-cooled internal combustion engine and estimating the thermal contact conductance in fixed and periodic contacts. due to the nature of internal combustion engines, the duration of contact between the valve and its seat is too short, and much time is needed to reach the quasi-steady state in the periodic contact between the exhaust valve and its seat. using the methods of linear extrapolation and the inverse solution, the surface contact temperatures and the fixed and periodic thermal contact conductance were calculated. the results of linear extrapolation and inverse methods have similar trends, and based on the error analysis, they are accurate enough to estimate the thermal contact conductance. moreover, due to the error analysis, a linear extrapolation method using inverse ratio is preferred. the effects of pressure, contact frequency, heat flux, and cooling air speed on thermal contact conductance have been investigated. the results show that by increasing the contact pressure the thermal contact conductance increases substantially. in addition, by increasing the engine speed the thermal contact conductance decreases. on the other hand, by boosting the air speed the thermal contact conductance increases, and by raising the heat flux the thermal contact conductance reduces. the average calculated error equals to 12.9%.
human_metabolism	the investigation of very complex dynamical systems like the human metabolism requires the comprehension of important subsystems. the present paper deals with energy supply chains as subsystems of the metabolism on the molecular, cellular, and individual levels. we form a mathematical model of ordinary differential equations and we show fundamental properties by fourier techniques. the results are supported by a transition from a system of ordinary differential equations to a partial differential equation, namely, a transport equation. in particular, the behavior of supply chains with dominant pull components is discussed. a special focus lies on the role of buffer compartments.
northern_blotting	matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) degrade collagen and mediate tissue remodeling. the novel cytokine il-17 is expressed during various inflammatory conditions and modulates mmp expression. we investigated the effect of il-17 on mmp-1 expression in primary human cardiac fibroblasts (hcf) and delineated the signaling pathways involved. hcf were treated with recombinant human il-17. mmp-1 expression was analyzed by northern blotting, rt-quantitative pcr, western blotting, and elisa; transcriptional induction and transcription factor binding by emsa, elisa, and reporter assay; and p38 mapk and erk1/2 activation by protein kinase assays and western blotting. signal transduction pathways were investigated using pharmacological inhibitors, small interfering rna (sirna), and adenoviral dominant-negative expression vectors. il-17 stimulated mmp-1 gene transcription, net mrna levels, protein, and promoter-reporter activity in hcf. this response was blocked by il-17 receptor- fc chimera and il-17 receptor antibodies, but not by il-6, tnf-alpha, or il-1 beta antibodies. il-17-stimulated type i collagenase activity was inhibited by the mmp inhibitor gm-6001 and by sirna-mediated mmp-1 knockdown. il-17 stimulated activator protein-1 [ap-1 (c-fos, c-jun, and fra-1)], nf-kappa b (p50 and p65), and ccaat enhancer-binding protein (c/ebp)-beta dna binding and reporter gene activities, effects attenuated by antisense oligonucleotides, sirna-mediated knockdown, or expression of dominant-negative signaling proteins. inhibition of ap-1, nf-kappa b, or c/ebp activation attenuated il-17-stimulated mmp-1 expression. il-17 induced p38 mapk and erk1/2 activation, and inhibition by sb-203580 and pd-98059 blunted il-17-mediated transcription factor activation and mmp-1 expression. our data indicate that il-17 induces mmp-1 in human cardiac fibroblasts directly via p38 mapk- and erk-dependent ap-1, nf-kappa b, and c/ebp-beta activation and suggest that il-17 may play a critical role in myocardial remodeling.
thermodynamics	to further investigate the porosity evolution during selective laser melting (slm) inconel 718 alloy, a transient mesoscale model with a randomly packed powder-bed has been proposed by finite volume method (fvm), taking consideration of the phase transition, variation of thermo-physical properties and interfacial force. the thermodynamics within molten pool and resulting porosity evolution behavior of a set of laser scanned tracks with various laser scanning speeds were studied using numerical approach. the results evidently revealed that the operating peak temperature was reduced obviously as increasing the scanning speeds. accordingly, the high cooling rate, short lifespan and limiting depth of pool and small velocity of molten liquid flow were obtained under a high scanning speed. scanning speed played a crucial role in determining the type of porosity in the terminally slm-processed inconel 718 components. at a high scanning speed of 500 mm/s, the top surface was primarily dominated by open porosity, accompanying with large-sized inter-layer porosity on the cross section, due to a limiting energy input penetrated into the powder-bed and incomplete melting of powder. by contrast, as a relatively low scanning speed of 200 mm/s was employed, the top surface appeared to be smooth free of less metallurgical porosity and no apparent inter-layer porosity on the cross section surface attributing to the escaping of porosity, indicating an well metallurgical bonding of the neighboring layer towards the building direction. simultaneously, the physical mechanism was thoroughly discussed. the simulated distribution of porosity was found to be consistent with the experimental measurements.
genetics	amphibians, as the first terrestrial vertebrates, offer a window into early major histocompatibility complex (mhc) evolution. we characterized the mhc class i of two korean amphibians, the asiatic toad (bufo gargarizans) and the japanese tree frog (hyla japonica). we found at least four transcribed mhc class i (mhc i) loci, the highest number confirmed in any anuran to date. furthermore, we identified mhc i transcripts in terrestrial adults, and possibly in aquatic larvae, of both species. we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on mhc i sequence data and found that b. gargarizans and h. japonica cluster together in the superfamily nobleobatrachia. we further identified three supertypes shared by the two species. our results reveal substantial variation in the number of mhc i loci in anurans and suggest that certain supertypes have particular physiochemical properties that may confer pathogen resistance.

genetics	species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes emerge as key organisms to understand the astonishing diversity of sex-determination systems. whereas new genomic methods are widening opportunities to study these systems, the difficulty to separately characterize their x and y homologous chromosomes poses limitations. here we demonstrate that two simple f-statistics calculated from sex-linked genotypes, namely the genetic distance (f-st) between sexes and the inbreeding coefficient (f-is) in the heterogametic sex, can be used as reliable proxies to compare sex-chromosome differentiation between populations. we correlated these metrics using published microsatellite data from two frog species (hyla arborea and rana temporaria), and show that they intimately relate to the overall amount of x-y differentiation in populations. however, the fits for individual loci appear highly variable, suggesting that a dense genetic coverage will be needed for inferring fine-scale patterns of differentiation along sex-chromosomes. the applications of these f-statistics, which implies little sampling requirement, significantly facilitate population analyses of sex-chromosomes.
thermodynamics	by the use of thermodynamics formalism of irreversible processes, complex systems theory and systems biology, it is derived a relationship between the production of entropy per unit time, the fractal dimension and the tumor growth rate for human tumors cells. the thermodynamics framework developed demonstrates that, the dissipation function is a landau potential and also the lyapunov function of the dynamical behavior of tumor growth, which indicate the directional character, stability and robustness of the phenomenon. the entropy production rate may be used as a quantitative index of the metastatic potential of tumors. the current theoretical framework will hopefully provide a better understanding of cancer and contribute to improvements in cancer treatment.

materials_engineering	one of the requirements for achieving faster cmos electronics is to mitigate the unacceptably large chip areas required to steer heat away from or, more recently, toward the critical nodes of state-of-the-art devices. thermal-guiding (tg) structures can efficiently direct heat by ""meta-materials"" engineering; however, some key aspects of the behavior of these systems are not fully understood. here, we demonstrate control of the thermal-diffusion properties of tg structures by using nanometer-scale, cmos-integrable, graphene-on-silica stacked materials through finite-element-methods simulations. it has been shown that it is possible to implement novel, controllable, thermally based boolean-logic and spike-timing dependent plasticity operations for advanced (neuromorphic) computing applications using such thermal-guide architectures.
molecular_biology	fourteen novel miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (mite) families are found in the florida carpenter ant genome, camponotus floridanus. they constitute approximately 0.63 % of the entire genome. analysis of their insertion time showed that most members of these mites were inserted into their host genome in less than 8 million years ago. in addition, the association between mites and the noncoding regions of genes in c. floridanus is random. interestingly, an autonomous partner (named cftec) responsible for the amplification of these mites was also found in c. floridanus. meanwhile, we present evidence, based on searches of publicly available databases, that this autonomous element was widespread in animals. moreover, structure and phylogenetic analyses supported that tecs might represent a novel cade of transposons intermediate between the classic cacta transposon and trcs. finally, their transposition mechanism and impact on host genome evolution were also discussed.
cell_biology	the objective of this study was to examine age-dependent changes in both t-1-weighted and t-2-weighted image contrasts and spin-echo t-2 relaxation time in the human brain during healthy ageing. a total of 37 participants between the ages of 49 and 87 years old were scanned with a 3 tesla system, using t-1-weighted, t-2 weighted and quantitative spin-echo t-2 imaging. contrast between image intensities and t-2 values was calculated for various regions, including between individual hippocampal subfields. the t-1 contrast-to-noise (cnr) and gray:white signal intensity ratio (gwr) did not change in the hippocampus, but it declined in the cingulate cortex with age. in contrast, t-2 cnr and gwr declined in both brain regions. t-2 relaxation time was almost constant in gray matter and most (but not all) hippocampal subfields, but increased substantially in white matter, pointing to an age effect on water relaxation in white matter. changes in t-1 and t-2 mr characteristics influence the appearance of brain images in later life and should be considered in image analyses of aged subjects. it is speculated that alterations at the cell biology level, with concomitant alterations to the local magnetic environment, reduce dephasing and subsequently prolong spin-echo t-2 through reduced diffusion effects in later life.
human_metabolism	the pig is increasingly being used in pharmacological and toxicological studies, and is the species of choice for future research into xenotransplantation, extracorporeal liver support and hepatocyte-based bioartificial liver. however, relatively little is known about xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in this species. in the present study, immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-rat and anti-human cytochrome p450 (cyp) antibodies revealed the presence of proteins in pig liver which cross-reacted with anti-human cyp1a2, cyp2d6 and cyp3a4, and with anti-rat cyp2e1 antibodies. northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of mrna which hybridized to cdna probes for human cyp2d6, cyp2e1 and cyp3a4, and to an oligonucleotide probe for pig cyp3a29. as there is a lack of a good animal model for cyp2d6, the presence of a cyp2d6-related protein in pig liver was of particular interest. pig hepatocytes also demonstrated cyp2d6 immunoreactive protein, and mrna hybridizable to a cyp2d6 cdna probe. we investigated the ability of pig li,er microsomes to catalyse dextromethorphan o-demethylation, a widely-used marker enzyme activity for cyp2d6. this enzyme activity demonstrated biphasic kinetics.,vith a high affinity apparent k-m1 = 6.9 +/- 3.6 mu m and v-max1 = 10.5 +/- 6.1 nmol/min/nmol cyp. the reaction was sensitive to inhibition by the cyp2d6-selective inhibitors quinidine, quinine, lobeline and nor-fluoxetine, whereas chemical inhibitors selective for other cyp isoforms failed to affect the reaction. we conclude that dextromethorphan o-demethylation is catalysed by a cyp2d enzyme which is remarkably similar to human cyp2d6, suggesting potential value of the pig as a model for predicting human metabolism of xenobiotics which undergo cyp2d6-dependent biotransformation, (c) 2000 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
thermodynamics	the aggregation of three different cyclodextrins (cds): 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (hp-b-cd), 2hydroxypropyl- g-cyclodextrin (hp-g-cd) and sulfobutylether-b-cyclodextrin (sbe-b-cd) was studied. the critical aggregation concentration (cac) of these three cds is quite similar and is situated at ca. 2% (m/v). there was only a small difference in the cac values determined by dls and 1h nmr. dls measurements revealed that cds in solution have three size populations wherein one of them is that of a single cd molecule. the size of aggregates determined by tem appears to be similar to the size of the aggregates in the second size distribution determined by dls. isodesmic and k-2-k self-assembly models were used for studying the aggregation process of hp-b-cd, hp-g-cd and sbe-b-cd. the results showed that the aggregation process of these cds is a cooperative one, where the first step of aggregation is less favorable than the next steps. the determined thermodynamic parameters showed that the aggregation process of all three cds is spontaneous and exothermic and it is driven by an increase of the entropy of the environment.

molecular_biology	fimbriae are protein-based filamentous appendages that protrude from the bacterial cell surface and facilitate host adhesion. two types of fimbriae, fima and mfa1, of the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis are responsible for adherence to other bacteria and to host cells in the oral cavity. both fimbrial forms are composed of 5 proteins, but there is limited information about their polymerization mechanisms. here, the authors evaluated the function of mfa5, one of the mfa1 fimbrial accessory proteins. using mfa5 gene disruption and complementation studies, the authors revealed that mfa5 affects the incorporation of other accessory proteins, mfa3 and mfa4, into fibers and the expression of fimbriae on the cell surface. mfa5 is predicted to have a c-terminal domain (ctd) that uses the type ix secretion system (t9ss), which is limited to this organism and related bacteroidetes species, for translocation across the outer membrane. to determine the relationship between the putative mfa5 ctd and the t9ss, mutants were constructed with in-frame deletion of the ctd and deletion of poru, a c-terminal signal peptidase linked to t9ss-mediated secretion. the ctd-expressing strain presented a similar phenotype to the mfa5 disruption mutant with reduced expression of fimbriae lacking all accessory proteins. the poru mutants and the ctd-expressing strain showed intracellular accumulation of mfa5. these results indicate that mfa5 function requires t9ss-mediated translocation across the outer membrane, which is dependent on the ctd, and subsequent incorporation into fibers. these findings suggest the presence of a novel polymerization mechanism of the p. gingivalis fimbriae.
immunology	esophageal cancer (ec) is a highly malignant tumor, and the overall survival rate remains very low. traditional treatment is not sufficiently effective, and thus, there is an urgent need for new and effective treatments. the advances in cancer immunotherapy have changed this situation because this type of therapy has a significant potential to eliminate tumors with little damage to normal tissue. this treatment primarily aims to enhance the ability of the immune system to eliminate tumors and prevent tumor immune escape, which is associated with immune surveillance. this review summarizes current cancer therapeutic strategies and immunotherapy studies to demonstrate the potential of immunotherapy for the treatment of ec.
enzymology	the hepatic peroxisomal alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (act) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-enzyme whose deficiency is responsible for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (ph1), an autosomal recessive disorder. in the last few years the knowledge of the characteristics of agt and the transfer of this information into some pathogenic variants have significantly contributed to the improvement of the understanding at the molecular level of the ph1 pathogenesis. in this review, the spectroscopic features, the coenzyme 's binding affinity, the steady-state kinetic parameters as well as the sensitivity to thermal and chemical stress of the two allelic forms of act, the major (agt-ma) and the minor (agt-mi) allele, have been described. moreover, we summarize the characterization obtained by means of biochemical and bioinformatic analyses of the following ph1-causing variants in the recombinant purified forms: g82e associated with the major allele, f1521 encoded on the background of the minor allele, and the g41 mutants which co-segregate either with the major allele (g41r-ma and g41v-ma) or with the minor allele (g41r-mi). the data have been correlated with previous clinical and cell biology results, which allow us to (i) highlight the functional differences between agt-ma and agt-mi, (ii) identify the structural and functional molecular defects of the pathogenic variants, (iii) improve the correlation between the genotype and the enzymatic phenotype, (iv) foresee or understand the molecular basis of the responsiveness to pyridoxine treatment of patients bearing these mutations, and (v) pave the way for new treatment strategies. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phospate enzymology.

computer-aided_design	in this paper, the authors present a polarisation dependent analytical model for dc, radio frequency (rf) and linearity characteristics of a proposed lattice-matched alinn/aln/gan metal-oxide-semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (moshemt). the developed model includes charge controlled analysis derived from triangular potential well approximation along with the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarisation effects. the model accurately predicts the threshold voltage, two-dimensional electron gas sheet charge density, drain current, transconductance and cut-off frequencies for different samples of gate dielectric materials such as sio2, hfo2 and al2o3 over a full range of gate and drain bias. a detailed analysis of the linearity characteristics by investigating the key figure-of-merit metrics such as second-order voltage intercept point, third-order voltage intercept point, third-order input intercept point and third-order intermodulation distortion are performed for different gate dielectric thicknesses of 5, 7 and 10 nm. the accuracy of the model results is verified against silvaco technology computer aided design numerical simulation results and found to be satisfactory. it is observed that by careful tuning the device parameters such as dielectric constant and dielectric thickness, lattice-matched alinn/aln/gan moshemt can considerably improve the device performance and suitable for high performance low distortion rf applications.
polymerase_chain_reaction	rabbit cells and models are frequently used in pharmacological experiments and toxicity tests and are particularly useful for corneal transplant experiments. here, we obtained a corneal endothelial cell line from normal rabbit corneal endothelium that had acquired infinite proliferative potential without requiring gene transfer. these infinitely proliferative rabbit corneal endothelial cells (ircecs) could be cultured for >250 generations and exhibited a greater ability to proliferate than did normal rabbit corneal endothelial cells (rcecs) cultivated by conventional methods. the results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and immunostaining analyses revealed that the expression profiles of corneal endothelial markers, such as collagen type viii1 and na+/k+-atpase, were similar to those of rcecs and in vivo corneal endothelium. scanning electron microscopy showed that many microvilli were present on the surface of the cells and that the ultrastructure was maintained. in addition, we verified that the ircecs had similar levels of pump function as did rcecs using an ussing chamber system. the results of a soft agar colony-formation assay suggested that the ircecs were not tumourigenic. taken together, our results demonstrated that the ircecs exhibited gene expression profiles and properties that were equivalent to those of native rabbit corneal endothelium, making these cells useful for corneal endothelial research studies. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
thermodynamics	to establish an adequate thermodynamic model for the mechanism of formation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) corrosion products, theoretical and experimental studies were combined in this work. the corrosion products of api x60 pipeline steel formed under different h2s corrosion conditions were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. a thermodynamic model was developed to clarify the environmental boundaries for the formation and transformation of different products. presumably, a dividing line with a negative slope existed between mackinawite and pyrrhotite. using experimental data presented in this study combined with previously published results, we validated the model to predict the formation of mackinawite and pyrrhotite on the basis of the laws of thermodynamics. the established relationship is expected to support the investigation of the h2s corrosion mechanism in the oil and gas industry.
enzymology	differences in the metabolism of tyrosine between insects and mammals present an interesting example of molecular evolution. both insects and mammals possess fine-tuned systems of enzymes to meet their specific demands for tyrosine metabolites; however, more homologous enzymes involved in tyrosine metabolism have emerged in many insect species. without knowledge of modern genomics, one might suppose that mammals, which are generally more complex than insects and require tyrosine as a precursor for important catecholamine neurotransmitters and for melanin, should possess more enzymes to control tyrosine metabolism. therefore, the question of why insects actually possess more tyrosine metabolic enzymes is quite interesting. it has long been known that insects rely heavily on tyrosine metabolism for cuticle hardening and for innate immune responses, and these evolutionary constraints are likely the key answers to this question. in terms of melanogenesis, mammals also possess a high level of regulation; yet mammalian systems possess more mechanisms for detoxification whereas insects accelerate pathways like melanogenesis and therefore must bear increased oxidative pressure. our research group has had the opportunity to characterize the structure and function of many key proteins involved in tyrosine metabolism from both insects and mammals. in this mini review we will give a brief overview of our research on tyrosine metabolic enzymes in the scope of an evolutionary perspective of mammals in comparison to insects.
polymerase_chain_reaction	conclusions: the levels of expression of various c-type lectin receptors (clrs) messenger ribo nucleic acids (mrnas) were significantly higher in cholesteatomas than in normal skin, suggesting that these clrs may be involved in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. objectives: altered expression of pattern recognition receptors may be associated with immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. this study assessed the levels of expression of clr mrnas in normal skin and in cholesteatoma. methods: cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 38 patients with acquired cholesteatoma. the levels of expression of various clr mrnas were assessed quantitatively using real-time rt-pcr (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and correlated with age, sex, the presence of bacteria, hearing level, frequency of surgery, and degree of ossicle destruction. results: the levels of cd206 (cluster of differentiation 206), dec-205 (dendritic and epithelial cell-205), mgl (monoacylglycerol lipase), clec5a (c-type lectin domain family 5 member a), dectin-2 (dendrite cell-associated c-type lectin-2), bdca2 (blood dendritic cell antigen 2), mincle, dcir (dendritic cell immunoreceptor), dectin-1, micl (myeloid inhibitory c type-like lectin), and clec12b (c-type lectin domain family 12, member b) mrnas were significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in control skin samples (p= 2 than <= 1 destroyed ossicles (p<0.05), and the levels of mgl, mincle, dectin-1, and clec12b mrnas were significantly higher in recurrent than initial cholesteatoma specimens (p<0.05). the level of clec5a mrnas was significantly higher in patients with severe than mild-to-moderate hearing loss (p<0.05). \
human_metabolism	cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2136 (cyp2b6) is a human cyp isoform found in variable amounts in the liver and other organs. it is known to be inducible and polymorphic and has a wide range of xenobiotic substrates. studies of cyp2136 to date have concentrated heavily on clinical drugs. in the present communication, however, we concentrate on its role in the metabolism of environmental xenobiotics. the term environment is used, in its broadest sense, to include natural ecosystems and agroecosystems as well as the industrial and indoor domestic environments. in essence, this excludes only clinical drugs and drugs of abuse. many of these chemicals, including agrochemicals and industrial chemicals, can serve as substrates, inhibitors and/or inducers of cyp2136, these activities being often modified by the existence of polymorphic variants. metabolism-based interactions between environmental chemicals are discussed, as well as the emerging possibility of metabolic interactions between environmental chemicals and clinical drugs.

computer-aided_design	due to the increasing adoption of immediate implantation strategies and the rapid development of the computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing technology, a therapeutic concept based on patient-specific implant dentistry has recently been reintroduced by many researchers. however, little information is available on the designs of custom-made dental implant systems, especially their biomechanical behavior. the influence of the custom-made implant designs on the biomechanical performance for both an immediate and a delayed loading protocol in the maxillary esthetic zone was evaluated by means of the finite element (fe) method. fe models of three dental implants were considered: a state of the art cylindrical implant and two custom-made implants designed by reverse engineering technology, namely a root-analogue implant and a root-analogue threaded implant. the von mises stress distributions and micro-motions around the bone-implant interfaces were calculated using ansys software. in a comparison of the three implant designs for both loading protocols, a favorable biomechanical performance was observed for the use of root-analogue threaded implant which approximated the geometry of natural anterior tooth and maintained the original long-axis. the results indicated that bone-implant interfacial micro-motion was reduced and a favorable stress distribution after osseointegration was achieved.
machine_design	this paper introduces a new electric machine for front-end accessory drive (fead) of hybrid electric vehicles (hevs). the novelty of the electric machine lies in its ability to perform multitasking. besides the independent motor or independent generator operation like any other electric machine, the proposed machine is able to run as motor and generator simultaneously. a dual winding electric machine forms the core part of the proposed system. windings of the electric machine are concentrated type so that electrical and magnetic isolation is maintained. this allows simultaneous motoring and generating operation in the single housing of electric machine. design considerations of the proposed electric machine have been outlined in the paper. comparison between proposed and conventional approaches has been made to highlight potential benefits of the new approach. thermal analyses have been performed to show the suitability and limits of the multitasked electric machine in the hev applications. overall performance of the proposed machine is presented by experimental results.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the aim of this single-center cross-sectional study was to detect the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogenic bacteria and active matrix metalloproteinase-8 (ammp-8) level in patients before (preltx) and after liver transplantation (postltx). periodontal pocket depth (ppd) and clinical attachment loss (cal) were assessed. subgingival biofilm samples were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect 11 common periodontal pathogens. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) samples were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) to determine ammp-8 level and assigned to a scoring system: score 0: 0-8 ng/ml, score 1: 8-20 ng/ml, and score 2: >20 ng/ml. the following were used for the statistical analysis: t test, mann-whitney u test, fishers test (alpha = 5 %). in total, 110 patients (preltx: n = 35, postltx: n = 75) could be included in the study. periodontal findings were not significantly different between groups. in microbiological analysis, a significantly higher prevalence of campylobacter rectus in preltx group was detected (p = 0.03). significantly more patients with score 0 in postltx group (p = 0.024) and significantly more patients with score 1 in preltx group were found (p = 0.004). furthermore, ammp-8 concentrations for patients with moderate periodontitis were significantly lower in postltx group compared to preltx group (p = 0.045). additionally, in postltx group, ammp-8 concentration was significantly higher in patients with severe periodontitis compared to those with no/mild periodontitis (p = 0.016). ltx appears to affect ammp-8 level, but not bacterial findings in patients after ltx. determination of ammp-8 level in patients after ltx with immunosuppressive medication might lead to wrong interpretation of the results.
human_metabolism	synthetic polyesters have deeply impacted various biomedical and engineering fields, such as tissue scaffolding and therapeutic delivery. currently, many applications involving polyesters are being explored with polymers derived from monomers that are endogenous to the human metabolism. examples of these monomers include glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol, and lactic, sebacic, citric, succinic, alpha-ketoglutaric, and fumaric acids. in terms of mechanical versatility, crystallinity, hydrophobicity, and biocompatibility, polyesters synthesized partially or completely from these monomers can display a wide range of properties. the flexibility in these macromolecular properties allows for materials to be tailored according to the needs of a particular application. along with the presence of natural monomers that allows for a high probability of biocompatibility, there is also an added benefit that this class of polyesters is more environmentally friendly than many other materials used in biomedical engineering. while the selection of monomers may be limited by nature, these polymers have produced or have the potential to produce an enormous number of successes in vitro and in vivo.
materials_engineering	metallurgical processes have been traditionally taught as extractive metallurgy of various metals. some 30 years ago the field of process metallurgy was advanced via the special attention given to the analysis and design of metallurgical processes on the basis of understanding and controlling the governing transport phenomena and kinetics. the above paradigm has served well graduates from metallurgical engineering programs in countries with strong metals producing industries like canada. over the past 10-15 years, however we have witnessed the total transformation of metallurgy programs to materials science and engineering programs. design and production of new advanced materials on the basis of processing-structure-property-performance relationships became the new paradigm. it is in this new context that teaching and research in extraction and processing is discussed in this article written on the occasion of the ralph lloyd harris memorial symposium.
human_metabolism	a rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was applied to human urine samples to discover new molecular biomarkers of the alteration of psychophysical well-being due to the environmental, physiological and confinement stress conditions achieved in the mars500 project. urine samples of crew members were submitted to metabolomic studies by means of separative techniques coupled with mass spectrometric techniques and data analysis. more than 2,000 metabolite features were found in each comparison, and more than 150 metabolites were identified for every differential analysis. significant modifications in eight metabolites were shared by the subjects under study.
immunology	antibodies against the toxin portion of recombinant immunotoxins (rit) reduce their efficacy and pose a potential safety risk. to overcome this problem we mutated the very immunogenic immunotoxin ss1p to produce lmb-t20, a de-immunized rit that has the eight human t-cell epitopes in ss1p modified or removed. to determine the effect of t-cell epitope removal in vivo we mapped the t-cell epitopes in immune-competent balb/c mice and found that these mice recognize two epitopes. one corresponds to the human immunodominant t-cell epitope and the other to a human subdominant epitope; both were eliminated in lmb-t20. we found that mice immunized with lmb-t20 did not have t-cell activation and did not develop anti-drug antibodies (ada), whereas mice immunized with ss1p, showed t-cell activation, and developed ada detected by both elisa and drug neutralizing assays. the ability of the mice treated with lmb-t20 to respond to other antigens was not compromised. we conclude that elimination of t-cell epitopes is sufficient to prevent formation of antibodies to an immunogenic foreign protein.cellular & molecular immunology (2017) published online 19 october 2015
strength_of_materials	in this paper, an attempt has been made to extend application of the recently proposed flexural constitutive model to short- and long-term deformational analysis of flexural partially prestressed concrete members. the proposed calculation technique is applied in a simple engineering technique based on principles of strength of materials and the layered approach. the effect of tension stiffening and non-linear time effects of creep and shrinkage are taken into account. effective modulus method is used for modeling of long-term deformations. short- and long-term deformation (curvatures) prediction results were tested against experimental data of partially prestressed concrete beams reported in the literature.
southern_blotting	an early light-inducible protein (gbelip) isolated from immature ginkgo leaves by rapid amplification of cdna ends method contains a 570 bp open reading frame encoding a 189 amino acid protein, with significant homology to early light-inducible proteins from other plant species. the genomic dna of gbelip gene contains three exons and two introns. southern blotting revealed that gbelip is a single-copy gene in ginkgo. light, defense and stress responsive element were found in the promoter region of gbelip. gbelip expressional patterns were detected by real-time pcr at various conditions. elip expressions were variable at different time points of 1 day and increasing significantly at the commencement of light illumination then dropping to a basal level gradually. elip expression in small size leaves (1-1.5 cm width and 7-day age) was higher then middle (2-3 cm width and 15-day age) and large (4 cm width and 30-day age) size leaves. it revealed that elip expression was under the control of developmental regulation. under temperature and light intensity treatments, gbelip transcripts accumulation may relate to photoinhibition. the peak expression of gbelip appeared later by chilling than heating. meanwhile, gbelip expression under high light was higher than low light at both two temperatures. gbelip expression was also increased by wounding and methyl jasmonate (meja) treatment, but not corresponded with increasing malondialdehyde (mda) concentration. in conclusion, gbelip appears to be induced by an imbalance between chlorophyll formation and degradation during development or under abiotic stress. these results suggest that gbelip may function in response to environmental signals, possibly regulating responses to abiotic stresses.
machine_design	recent experiments on the asdex upgrade tokamak aim at improving the physics base for iter and demo to aid the machine design and prepare efficient operation. type i edge localized mode (elm) mitigation using resonant magnetic perturbations (rmps) has been shown at low pedestal collisionality (nu(*)(ped) < 0.4). in contrast to the previous high nu* regime, suppression only occurs in a narrow rmp spectral window, indicating a resonant process, and a concomitant confinement drop is observed due to a reduction of pedestal top density and electron temperature. strong evidence is found for the ion heat flux to be the decisive element for the l-h power threshold. a physics based scaling of the density at which the minimum p-lh occurs indicates that iter could take advantage of it to initiate h-mode at lower density than that of the final q = 10 operational point. core density fluctuation measurements resolved in radius and wave number show that an increase of r/l-te introduced by off-axis electron cyclotron resonance heating (ecrh) mainly increases the large scale fluctuations. the radial variation of the fluctuation level is in agreement with simulations using the gene code. fast particles are shown to undergo classical slowing down in the absence of large scale magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) events and for low heating power, but show signs of anomalous radial redistribution at large heating power, consistent with a broadened off-axis neutral beam current drive current profile under these conditions. neoclassical tearing mode (ntm) suppression experiments using electron cyclotron current drive (eccd) with feedback controlled deposition have allowed to test several control strategies for iter, including automated control of (3,2) and (2,1) ntms during a single discharge. disruption mitigation studies using massive gas injection (mgi) can show an increased fuelling efficiency with high field side injection, but a saturation of the fuelling efficiency is observed at high injected mass as needed for runaway electron suppression. large locked modes can significantly decrease the fuelling efficiency and increase the asymmetry of radiated power during mgi mitigation. concerning power exhaust, the partially detached iter divertor scenario has been demonstrated at p-sep/r = 10 mw m(-1) in asdex upgrade, with a peak time averaged target load around 5 mw m(-2), well consistent with the component limits for iter. developing this towards demo, full detachment was achieved at p-sep/r = 7 mw m(-1) and stationary discharges with core radiation fraction of the order of demo requirements (70% instead of the 30% needed for iter) were demonstrated. finally, it remains difficult to establish the standard iter q = 10 scenario at low q(95) = 3 in the all-tungsten (all-w) asdex upgrade due to the observed poor confinement at low beta(n). this is mainly due to a degraded pedestal performance and hence investigations at shifting the operational point to higher beta(n) by lowering the current have been started. at higher q(95), pedestal performance can be recovered by seeding n-2 as well as cd4, which is interpreted as improved pedestal stability due to the decrease of bootstrap current with increasing z(eff). concerning advanced scenarios, the upgrade of ecrh power has allowed experiments with central ctr-eccd to modify the q-profile in improved h-mode scenarios, showing an increase in confinement at still good mhd stability with flat elevated q-profiles at values between 1.5 and 2.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background:extrapulmonary tuberculosis (eptb) constitutes about 15% to 20% of all cases of tuberculosis (tb). the confirmation of eptb has always been a challenge to laboratory personnel. we aim to evaluate the diagnostic potential of immunostaining with anti-mpt64 in various eptb specimens.materials and methods:we studied a total of 51 tb cases and 38 non-tb control specimens comprising of fine-needle aspirates and formalin-fixed biopsies. these were investigated using a combination of the ziehl-neelsen method, the lowenstein-jensen culture, immunostaining with anti-mpt64 and anti-bcg, and nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for is6110. results of all the tests were compared using nested-pcr as the gold standard.results:diagnostic validation of immunostaining for anti-mpt64 was performed using nested-pcr as the gold standard. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for immunostaining with anti-mpt64 were 100%, 97%, 97%, and 100%, respectively.conclusions:immunostaining using anti-mpt64 is a rapid and sensitive method for establishing an early and specific diagnosis of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. the technique is simple to be incorporated into routine pathology laboratories.
southern_blotting	a reproducible and highly efficient protocol for genetic transformation mediated by agrobacterium has been established for greengram (vigna radiata l. wilczek). double cotyledonary node (dcn) explants were inoculated with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba 4404 harboring a binary vector pcambia 2301 containing neomycin phosphotransferase (npt ii) gene as selectable marker, beta-glucuronidase (gus) as a reporter (uida) gene and annexin 1 bj gene. important parameters like optical density of agrobacterium culture, culture quantity, infection medium, infection and co-cultivation time and acetosyringone concentration were standardized to optimize the transformation frequency. kanamycin at a concentration of 100 mg/l was used to select transformed cells. transient and stable gus expressions were studied in transformed explants and regenerated putative plants, respectively. transformed shoot were produced on regeneration medium containing 100 mg/l kanamycin and 250 mg/l cefotaxime and rooted on 1/2 ms medium. transient and constitutive gus expression was observed in dcn explants and different tissues of t-0 and t-1 plants. rooted t-0 and t-1 shoots confirming polymerase chain reaction (pcr) positive for npt ii and annexin 1bj genes were taken to maturity to collect the seeds. integration of annexin gene into the greengram genome was confirmed by southern blotting.
internal_combustion_engine	commercial vehicles are a common mode of transport employed in the urban freight transport. normally, they are internal combustion engine (ice) vehicles powered by burning fossil fuels. however, with deteriorating air quality and decreasing energy resources, ice vehicles are experiencing a significant transition. electric commercial vehicles (ecvs) as a feasible alternative to alleviate emissions and save energy resources are proposed in the field of urban freight transport. nevertheless, with the increasing intention of adopting ecvs, the number of employed ecvs is lower than ice vehicles and electric passenger cars. therefore, this paper reviewed and analyzed 25 related articles to collect factors affecting the employment. furthermore, we classified the factors into the three pillars of sustainability with integrating technological dimension. the results illustrate the influence of positive factors and negative factors on the employment. the future work will focus on ranking the priorities of factors and suggesting the logistics company to consider ecvs in their fleets thereby improving the adoption and the sustainable urban freight transport.
genetics	parents have the opportunity to educate their children to facilitate behaviours and lifestyle habits that may prevent or delay genetic disease, or mitigate predispositions within the family. we sought to determine parents' understanding of genetic knowledge and heritability. using a quantitative survey methodology 108 volunteer participants were surveyed from a convenience sample of all parents/caregivers within the waiting room of a general children 's outpatient clinic. results indicated that average genetic knowledge levels were fairly high, with the majority of participants scoring 70-80 % correct on knowledge-based questions. further, scores were found to be positively correlated with education, but inversely correlated with self-perceived knowledge. this finding suggests that participants with less experience tended to overestimate their knowledge. we suggest that gaps in knowledge of genetics and heritability could be improved by using educational interventions such as media campaigns, provision of informational brochures, or changes to current high school curriculum which would increase exposure to genetics and heritability for both parents and children.
northern_blotting	high metabolic activity and low levels of antioxidant enzymes make neurons particularly prone to damage by reactive oxygen species. thus, repair of oxidative dna damage is essential for normal brain function. base excision repair is the major pathway for repair of oxidative dna damage, and is initiated by dna glycosylases recognizing and removing the damaged base. in mammalian cells at least five different dna glycosylases with overlapping substrate specificity, neil1, neil2, neil3, ogg1 and nth1, remove oxidative dna base lesions. here we report mrna expression and distribution of these five dna glycosylases in human and rodent brains using in situ hybridization and northern blotting supported by glycosylase activity assays. neil1, neil2, ogg1 and nth1 showed widespread expression at all ages. in situ hybridization studies in mouse brain showed that expression of mneil1 increased with age. in newborn mouse brain, mneil3 revealed a discrete expression pattern in brain regions known to harbour stem cell populations, i.e., the subventricular zone, the rostral migratory stream, and the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. expression of mneil3 decreased with age, and in old mice brains could be detected only in layer v of neocortex. mnth1 was constitutively expressed during lifespan. in northern blots, mogg1 expression showed a transient decrease followed by an increase after 8 weeks of age. assays for fapy dna glycosylase activity revealed increased activity level with age in all brain regions analyzed.
cell_biology	vascular disease, such as atherosclerosis and diabetic vasculopathy, is frequently complicated by vascular calcification. previously believed to be an end-stage process of unregulated mineral precipitation, it is now well established to be a multi-faceted disease influenced by the characteristics of its vascular location, the origins of calcifying cells and numerous regulatory pathways. it reflects the fundamental plasticity of the vasculature that is gradually being revealed by progress in vascular and stem cell biology. this review provides a brief overview of where we stand in our understanding of vascular calcification, facing the challenge of translating this knowledge into viable preventive and therapeutic strategies.

machine_design	electric machines are a key component of electric/hybrid electric vehicle (ev/hev) powertrains. thus, computationally efficient models for electric machines are essential for powertrain-level design, simulation, and optimization. in this paper, a finite-element-based method for quickly generating torque-speed curves and efficiency maps for electric machines is presented. first, magnetostatic finite-element analysis (fea) is conducted on a "" base"" machine design. this analysis produces torque, normalized losses, flux linkage, and the maximum magnetic field intensity in the permanent magnets for a wide range of currentmagnitudes and phase angles. these values are then scaled based upon changing the size of the machine and the effective number of turns of the machine windings to quickly generate a variety of new machine designs and their corresponding efficiency maps using postprocessing techniques. results suggest that, by avoiding resolving the fea for the scaled designs, the proposed techniques can be used to quickly generate efficiency maps, and thus are useful for ev/hev powertrain-level simulation and optimization.
enzymology	polyketides are structurally and functionally diverse secondary metabolites that are biosynthesized by polyketide synthases (pkss) using acyl-coa precursors. recent studies in the engineering and structural characterization of pkss have facilitated the use of target enzymes as biocatalysts to produce novel functionally optimized polyketides. these compounds may serve as potential drug leads. this review summarizes the insights gained from research on type iii pkss, from the discovery of chalcone synthase in plants to novel pkss in bacteria and fungi. to date, at least 15 families of type iii pkss have been characterized, highlighting the utility of pkss in the development of natural product libraries for therapeutic development.
fluid_mechanics	testicular compartment syndrome (tcs) refers to the impairment of microcirculation in the testicle due to either increased venous resistance or extraluminal compression, which leads to hypoxia. tcs releases oxidants through hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion injury (iri). the pathophysiology, etiology, evaluation, and management of tcs are reviewed. based on the properties of tcs, specific causes, e.g., varicocele, hydrocele, orchitis, cryptorchidism, and scrotal hernia, are suggested and categorized. the oxidant-induced stress from tcs may explain the correlations between these causes and infertility. a chief shortcoming of current imaging modalities is that they detect tcs late after it has progressed to impair the macrocirculation of the testicle. we propose frequent sequential periodic power doppler ultrasonography to monitoring for earlier detection. intraoperatively, tcs can be diagnosed by the dull purple appearance of a hypoxic testicle and by tissue pressures above 30 mmhg. when compartment pressure is low, the underlying etiology must be promptly treated. during acute presentation, an incision of the resilient tunica albuginea may be necessary. a great challenge of treating tcs is restoring microcirculation while minimizing iri; concomitant antioxidant therapy secondary to treatment may be effective and harmless at the least. because testicular oxidant stress is common in infertility and since tcs can cause such a stress, tcs may be a larger factor in infertility than currently suspected.
polymerase_chain_reaction	glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system, which results in both a poor prognosis and outcome because of the aggressive progression of disease, growth and resistance to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. mir-140-5p is a small, non-coding single-stranded rna molecule, which was previously studied in the settings of human tongue cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. however, detailed data that formally demonstrate the contribution of mir-140-5p to glioma development are missing. similarly, relatively little is known about the relationship of mir-140-5p, vascular endothelial growth factor a, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in glioma progression. in this study, we found that mir-140-5p expression was significantly decreased in glioma tissues and in the glioma cell-lines u87 and u251 as compared with non-cancerous brain tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. in addition, mir-140-5p inhibited glioma cell proliferation and invasion and promoted glioma cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. interestingly, while the expression levels of mir-140-5p were higher in glioma cells, the messenger rna or protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor a and matrix metalloproteinase-2 were lower in glioma cells as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot assay, and immunohistochemistry. by contrast, downregulation in the expression levels of mir-140-5p augmented the messenger rna and protein expression levels of both vascular endothelial growth factor a and matrix metalloproteinase-2. these findings suggested that mir-140-5p inhibited glioma proliferation and invasion by regulating the vascular endothelial growth factor a/matrix metalloproteinase-2 signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo.
manufacturing_engineering	target is a collaborative project involving a partnership of universities and institutes of higher education in uk, ireland, norway, finland and sweden. the project will develop tools to enhance capacity in regional manufacturing companies to adapt and embrace new technologies and innovation. this is to be done in collaboration with small/medium sized manufacturing engineering companies - developing, applying and piloting the tools through individual companies' processes. the toolbox developed will consist of subsets such as digital manufacturing (robotics and simulation), new ideas and thinking (human centred and environmental thinking, competitiveness), business models and modern product innovation. on completion of the project, the toolbox of supports will be made available for use through open access to manufacturing companies. the initial project phase with development of a toolbox suitable for use in all the project partners' regions is presented.
southern_blotting	to investigate the possibility of horizontal gene transfer between agricultural microorganisms and soil microorganisms in the environment, bacillus subtilis kb producing iturin and the pgpr recombinant strain pseudomonas fluorescens mx1 were used as model microorganisms. the soil samples of cucumber or tomato plants cultivated in pots and the greenhouse for a six month period were investigated by pcr, real-time pcr, southern hybridization, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) fingerprinting. our data from southern blotting and t-rflp patterns suggest that the model bacteria do not give significant impacts on the other bacteria in the pots and greenhouse during cultivation.
molecular_biology	purpose: to evaluate the expression of egfr, kras genes, micrornas-21 and 203 in colon and rectal cancer samples, correlated with their age at diagnosis, histological subtype, value of pretreatment cea, tnm staging and clinical outcome. methods: expression of genes and micrornas by real time pcr in tumor and non-tumor samples obtained from surgical treatment of 50 patients. results: an increased expression of micrornas-21 and 203 in tumor samples in relation to non-tumor samples was found. there was no statistically significant difference between the expression of these genes and micrornas when compared to age at diagnosis and histological subtype. the egfr gene showed higher expression in relation to the value of cea diagnosis. the expression of microrna-203 was progressively lower in relation to the tnm staging and was higher in the patient group in clinical remission. conclusions: the therapy of colon and rectum tumors based on micrornas remains under investigation reserving huge potential for future applications and clinical interventions in conjunction with existing therapies. we expect, based on the exposed data, to stimulate the development of new therapeutic possibilities, making the treatment of these tumors more effective.
polymerase_chain_reaction	noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans. real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time rt-pcr) is a promising molecular method for the detection of noroviruses. in this study, the performance of three taqman real-time rt-pcr assays was assessed, which were one commercially available real-time rt-pcr kit (assay a: norovirus real time rt-pcr kit) and two in-house real-time rt-pcr assays (assay b: lightcycler rna master hybprobe and assay c: realtime ready rna virus master). assays a and b showed higher sensitivity than assay c for norovirus gi, while they all had the same sensitivity (103 dna copies/ml) for gii dna standard controls. assay b had the highest efficiency for both genogroups. no cross-reactivity was observed among gi and gii noroviruses, rotavirus, hepatitis a virus, and poliovirus. the detection rates of these assays in gi and gii norovirus-positive fecal samples were not significantly different. however, the mean quantification cycle (cq) value of assay b for gii was lower than assays a and c with statistical significance (p-value, 0.000). all three real-time rt-pcr assays could detect a variety of noroviruses including gi. 2, gii. 2, gii. 3, gii. 4, gii. 6, gii. 12, gii. 17, and gii. 21. this study suggests assay b as a suitable assay for the detection and quantification of noroviruses gi and gii due to good analytical sensitivity and higher performance to amplify norovirus on dna standard controls and clinical samples.
thermodynamics	antimony (sb), which can be toxic at relatively low concentrations, may co-exist with mn(ii) and/or fe(ii) in some groundwater and surface water bodies. here we investigated the potential oxidation and adsorption pathways of sb (iii and v) species in the presence of mn(ii) and mn-oxidizing bacteria, with or without fe(ii). batch experiments were conducted to determine the oxidation and adsorption characteristics of sb species in the presence of biogenic mn oxides (bmos), which were formed in-situ via the oxidation of mn(ii) by a mn-oxidizing bacterium (pseudomonas sp. qjx-1). results indicated that sb(iii) ions could be oxidized to sb(v) ions by bmo, but only sb(v) originating from sb(iii) oxidation was adsorbed effectively by bmo. introduced fe(ii) was chemically oxidized to feooh, the precipitates of which mixed with bmo to form a new compound, biogenic fe-mn oxides (bfmo). the bmo part of the bfmo mainly oxidized and the feooh of the bfmo mainly adsorbed the sb species. in aquatic solutions containing both as(iii) and sb(iii), the bfmo that formed in-situ preferentially oxidized sb over as but adsorbed as more efficiently. chemical analysis and reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the presence of fe(ii), as(iii) and sb(iii) accelerated the oxidation of mn(ii) but inhibited the activity of mn-oxidizing bacteria. these results provide significant insights into the biogeochemical pathways of sb, mn(ii) in aquatic ecosystems, with or without fe(ii).

enzymology	though some genetic features of lactobacillar fructan hydrolases were elucidated, information about their enzymology or mutational analyses were scarce. lactobacillus casei iam1045 exhibits extracellular activity degrading inulin. after partial purification of the inulin-degrading protein from the spent culture medium, several fragments were obtained by protease digestion. based on their partial amino-acid sequences, oligonucleotide primers were designed, and its structural gene (levh1) was determined using the gene library constructed in the e. coli system. the levh1 gene encoded a protein (designated as levh1), of which calculated molecular mass and pl were 138.8-kda and 4.66, respectively. levh1 (1296 amino-acids long) was predicted to have a four-domain structure, containing (i) an n-terminal secretion signal of 40 amino-acids, (ii) variable domain of about 140 residues whose function is unclear, (iii) a catalytic domain of about 630 residues with glycoside-hydrolase activity consisting of two modules, a five-blade beta-propeller module linked to a beta-sandwich module, (iv) a c-terminal domain of about 490 residues comprising five nearly perfect repeat sequences of 80 residues homologous to equivalents of other hypothetical cell surface proteins, followed by 37-residues rich in ser/thr/pro/gly, a pentad lpqag (the lpxtg homologue). when overproduced in e. coli, the putative variable-catalytic domain region of about 770 residues exhibited exo-inulinase activity. deletion analyses demonstrated that the variable-catalytic domain region containing two modules is important for enzymatic activity. presence of eight conserved motifs (i-viii) was suggested in the catalytic domain by comparative analysis, among which motif viii was newly identified in the beta-sandwich module in this study. site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino-acids in these motifs revealed that d198, r388, d389 and e440, were crucial for inulinase activity. moreover, mutations of d502a and d683a in motif vi and viii respectively caused significant decrease in the activity. these results suggested that the variable domain and beta-sandwich module, besides the beta-propeller module, are important for inulin-degrading activity of levh1.

northern_blotting	the expression of cytochrome p-450 and cytochrome p-450 reductase (cpr) genes in the conterminous biotransformation of corticosteroids and pahs was studied in cunninghamella elegans 1785/21gp. we had previously used this strain as a microbial eucaryotic model for studying the relationship between mammalian steroid hydroxylation and the metabolization of pahs. we reported that cytochrome p-450 reductase is involved in the biotransformaton of cortexolone and phenanthrene. rt-pcr and northern blotting analyses indicated that the cytochrome p-450 and cpr genes appear to be inducible by both steroids and pahs. the expression of the cytochrome p-450 gene was increased ninefold and the expression of the cpr gene increased 6.4-fold in cultures with cortexolone and/or phenanthrene in comparison with controls. we conclude that the increase in cytochrome p-450 gene expression was accompanied by an increase in cytochrome p-450 enzymatic activity levels.
human_metabolism	details of the major pathways of metabolism have been elucidated, in large measure through work on experimental animals. it is unlikely that they differ qualitatively between mammalian species. the more important challenge facing researchers today is that of metabolic regulation, and of the integrated control of metabolic pathways in the whole organism. these aspects may well differ quantitatively or even qualitatively between species. in this review, methods for studying metabolism and metabolic regulation in humans are described. there are both scientific and practical advantages to performing studies of metabolic regulation in humans. the scientific advantages are clear from some fundamental differences in metabolic regulation between rats and humans, such as the importance of de novo lipogenesis to the deposition of body fat, and the metabolism of atherogenic triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. the practical advantages result mainly from the size of a human compared with that of most laboratory animals, enabling large blood samples to be obtained, and several measurement techniques to be applied at one time. reasons for the persistence of animal experimentation as the norm, rather than the exception, among life science researchers are discussed.
polymerase_chain_reaction	in preclinical studies, heregulin (hrg) expression was shown to be the most relevant predictive biomarker for response to patritumab, a fully human anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 3 monoclonal antibody. in support of a phase 2 study of erlotinib +/- patritumab in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), a reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) assay for relative quantification of hrg expression from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) nsclc tissue samples was developed and validated and described herein. test specimens included matched ffpe normal lung and nsclc and frozen nsclc tissue, and hrg-positive and hrg-negative cell lines. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was examined for functional performance. heregulin distribution was also analyzed across 200 nsclc commercial samples. applied biosystems taqman gene expression assays were run on the bio-rad cfx96 real-time pcr platform. heregulin rt-qpcr assay specificity, pcr efficiency, pcr linearity, and reproducibility were demonstrated. the final assay parameters included the qiagen ffpe rna extraction kit for rna extraction from ffpe nsclc tissue, 50 ng of rna input, and 3 reference (housekeeping) genes (hmbs, ipo8, and eif2b1), which had expression levels similar to hrg expression levels and were stable among ffpe nsclc samples. using the validated assay, unimodal hrg distribution was confirmed across 185 evaluable ffpe nsclc commercial samples. feasibility of an rtqpcr assay for the quantification of hrg expression in ffpe nsclc specimens was demonstrated.
hydraulics	critical heat flux (chf) is important to thermal-hydraulics design and safety analysis. in the purpose to validate the chf data acquired from ls-thtf of npic, experimental investigation on repeatability of the chf data is carried out with full length non-uniform axial heat flux distribution rod bundle. the repeatability of the chf data from ls-thtf itself is examined by comparing the data from the same run but different time and data from different runs. the rod bundle powers of chf data acquired under well controlled parameters are directly compared with reference measured data from htrf of columbia university. the rod bundle power ratio of chf data is employed to describe the repeatability of chf data from ls-thtf to htrf, and the variations of power ratio with inlet and outlet parameters show a reasonable trend. the point to point differences of chf power between the two facilities of every single point are found to be within 5%. the result demonstrates good repeatability between data from ls-thtf and data from htrf. ls-thtf is capable of acquiring reliable and repeatable chf data to verifying thermal-hydraulics performance of pwr fuel assemblies.

polymerase_chain_reaction	exportin 5 (xpo5) is a microrna (mirna)-related nuclear export protein, and its disorder may lead to the dysregulation of mirnas. recent studies have demonstrated that the aberrant expression of xpo5 might participate in carcinogenesis in certain cancers. however, there is only limited information of xpo5 in thyroid cancer (tc) development. in our study, we quantified the expression level of xpo5 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in 64 tc patients' cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. after confirming the xpo5 expression, we evaluated the association between xpo5 potential functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and risk of tc in a chinese population (1140 cases vs 1230 controls). finally, luciferase assays were performed to investigate the function of the snp in xpo5 3' untranslation region. the message ribonucleic acid (rna) levels of xpo5 were significantly lower in cancer tissues than normal tissues (p=0.004). in snps screening, only 1 noble snp rs11077 was identified in xpo5 functional region. the results in our case-control study also confirmed that xpo5 rs11077 was significantly associated with onset of tc (gt/gg vs tt p=0.035, adjusted odds ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.54). the adverse influence of this polymorphism was mainly observed in age >45 years (p=0.028), female (p=0.020), t1 staging (p=0.026), n1 (p=0.038), metastasis (p=0.031 m0, and p=0.035 for m1), and early stage (i+ii) (p=0.021). a following luciferase test revealed the critical role of rs11077 for triggering the xpo5 expression. furthermore, patients with g allele of rs11077 showed lower xpo5 expression level. xpo5 snp rs11077 influences the expression of xpo5, and this snp could also be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of tc in clinical, especially in chinese population.
immunology	lipid analysis performed by high performance thin layer chromatography (hptlc) is a relatively simple, cost-effective method of analyzing a broad range of lipids. the function of lipids (e. g., in host-pathogen interactions or host entry) has been reported to play a crucial role in cellular processes. here, we show a method to determine lipid composition, with a focus on the cholesterol level of primary blood-derived neutrophils, by hptlc in comparison to high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the aim was to investigate the role of lipid/cholesterol alterations in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). net release is known as a host defense mechanism to prevent pathogens from spreading within the host. therefore, blood-derived human neutrophils were treated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (m beta cd) to induce lipid alterations in the cells. using hptlc and hplc, we have shown that m beta cd treatment of the cells leads to lipid alterations associated with a significant reduction in the cholesterol content of the cell. at the same time, m beta cd treatment of the neutrophils led to the formation of nets, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. in summary, here we present a detailed method to study lipid alterations in neutrophils and the formation of nets.
materials_engineering	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to numerically solve the problem of steady mixed convection boundary layer flow past a vertical flat plate embedded in a fluid-saturated porous medium filled by a nanofluid. the non-darcy equation model along with the mathematical nanofluid model proposed by tiwari and das (2007) has been used. design/methodology/approach - using appropriate similarity transformations, the basic partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations. these equations have been solved numerically for different values of the nanoparticle volume fraction, the mixed convection and the non-darcy parameters using the bvp4c function from matlab. a stability analysis has been also performed. findings - numerical results are obtained for the reduced skin-friction, heat transfer and for the velocity and temperature profiles. the results indicate that dual solutions exist for the opposing flow case (lambda<0). the stability analysis indicates that for the opposing flow case, the lower solution branch is unstable, while the upper solution branch is stable. in addition, it is shown that for a regular fluid (phi=0) a very good agreement exists between the present numerical results and those reported in the open literature. research limitations/implications - the problem is formulated for three types of nanoparticles, namely, copper (cu), alumina (al2o3) and titania (tio2). however, the paper present results here only for the cu nanoparticles. the analysis reveals that the boundary layer separates from the plate. beyond the turning point it is not possible to get the solution based on the boundary-layer approximations. to obtain further solutions, the full basic partial differential equations have to be solved. practical implications - nanofluids have many practical applications, for example, the production of nanostructured materials, engineering of complex fluids, for cleaning oil from surfaces due to their excellent wetting and spreading behavior, etc. social implications - nanofluids could be applied to almost any disease treatment techniques by reengineering the nanoparticle properties. originality/value - the present results are original and new for the boundary-layer flow and heat transfer past a vertical flat plate embedded in a porous medium saturated by a nanofluid. therefore, this study would be important for the researchers working in porous media in order to become familiar with the flow behavior and properties of such nanofluids.
manufacturing_engineering	a blanking method which can punch the sheet metal without burr is presented, this method is divided into two stages: preloading deformation and blanking. and the fem software deform-2d is used to simulate the blanking process of burr-free of stainless steel aisi304. by changing the size of relative clearance, analyzing the quality of cross-section and blanking process. the result shows that the clearance has an effect on blanking force and the length of shear zone. which provides the certain fundamental for predicting the defects of blanking pieces and designing the molds. and this method has an important application value in manufacturing engineering.
enzymology	background: the ige-binding dna aptamer 17.4 is known to inhibit the interaction of ige with the high-affinity ige fc receptor fc epsilon r1. while this and other aptamers have been widely used and studied, there has been relatively little investigation of the kinetics and energetics of their interactions with their targets, by either single-molecule or ensemble methods. methods: the dissociation kinetics of the d17.4/ige complex and the effects of temperature and ionic strength were studied using fluorescence anisotropy and single-molecule spectroscopy, and activation parameters calculated. results: the dissociation of d17.4/ige complex showed a strong dependence on temperature and salt concentration. the k(off) of d17.4/ige complex was calculated to be (2.92 +/- 0.18) x 10(-3) s(-1) at 50 mm nacl, and (1.44 +/- 0.02) x 10(-2) s(-1) at 300 mm nacl, both in 1 mm mgcl2 and 25 degrees c. the dissociation activation energy for the d17.4/ige complex, e-a, was 16.0 +/- 1.9 kcal mol(-1) at 50 mm nacl and 1 mm mgcl2. interestingly, we found that the c19a mutant of d17.4 with stabilized stem structure showed slower dissociation kinetics compared to d17.4. single-molecule observations of surface-immobilized d17.4/ige showed much faster dissociation kinetics, and heterogeneity not observable by ensemble techniques. conclusions: the increasing k(off) value with increasing salt concentration is attributed to the electrostatic interactions between d17.4/ige. we found that both the changes in activation enthalpy and activation entropy are insignificant with increasing nacl concentration. the slower dissociation of the mutant c19a/ige complex is likely due to the enhanced stability of the aptamer. general significance: the activation parameters obtained by applying transition state analysis to kinetic data can provide details on mechanisms of molecular recognition and have applications in drug design. single-molecule dissociation kinetics showed greater kinetic complexity than was observed in the ensemble in-solution systems, potentially reflecting conformational heterogeneity of the aptamer. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

cell_biology	purpose of review kruppel-like factors (klfs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate integral functions of endothelial cells including inflammation, proliferation, growth, apoptosis, cell differentiation and plasticity, and migration. this review will focus on the role of klfs in physiological activity and their loss in vascular pathology. recent findings new studies have pointed at the role of micrornas as repressors of klfs in atherosclerotic areas providing another level of signaling regulation of klfs. summary klfs are important regulators of almost all facets of endothelial biology, making them a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. further research is needed to fully characterize their functions.
polymerase_chain_reaction	ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites of great medical and veterinary significance that can transmit bacteria, protozoa, fungi and viruses, causing a variety of human and animal diseases worldwide. in the present study, the intestinal bacterial flora associated with haemaphysalis flava ticks in different developmental stages were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). eleven distinct dgge bands were found using pcr-dgge method. sequences analyses indicated that they belonged to bacillus cereus, candidatus rickettsia, erwinia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, pectobacterium carotovorum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, rickettsia peacockii, rickettsia helvetica, rickettsia slovaca, staphylococcus simulans and uncultured bacterium clone. our find that the k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa isolates were presented in all h. flava ticks in different developmental stages. the present results indicated that zoonotic pathogens are present in h. flava ticks in henan province, china. to our knowledge, this is the first report on intestinal bacterial flora associated with h. flava ticks in china.
human_metabolism	background and objective: phytoestrogens (weak estrogens found in plants or derived from plant precursors by human metabolism) have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of a number of cancers. however, epidemiologic studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of a comprehensive phytoestrogen database for quantifying exposure. the purpose of this research was to develop such a database for use with food-frequency questionnaires in large epidemiologic studies. methods: the database is based on consumption patterns derived from semistructured interviews with 118 african-american, latina, and white women residing in california 's san francisco bay area. hplc-mass spectrometry was used to determine the content of seven specific phytoestrogenic compounds (i.e. the isoflavones: genistein, daidzein, biochanin a, and formononetin; the coumestan: coumestrol; and the plant lignans: matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol) in each of 112 food items/groups. results: traditional soy-based foods were found to contain high levels of genistein and daidzein, as expected, as well as substantial amounts of coumestrol. a wide variety of ""hidden"" sources of soy (that is, soy protein isolate, soy concentrate, or soy flour added to foods) was observed. several other foods (such as various types of sprouts and dried fruits, garbanzo beans, asparagus, garlic, and licorice) were also found to be substantial contributors of one or more of the phytoestrogens analyzed. conclusions: databases, such as the one described here, are important in assessing the relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and cancer risk in epidemiologic studies. agencies, such as the united states department of agriculture (usda), that routinely provide data on food composition, on which epidemiologic investigations into dietary health effects are based, should consider instituting programs for the analysis of phytochemicals, including the phytoestrogens.
immunology	the ability of the adaptive immune system to respond to arbitrary pathogens stems from the broad diversity of immune cell surface receptors. this diversity originates in a stochastic dna editing process (vdj recombination) that acts on the surface receptor gene each time a new immune cell is created from a stem cell. by analyzing t-cell receptor (tcr) sequence repertoires taken from the blood and thymus of mice of different ages, we quantify the changes in the vdj recombination process that occur from embryo to young adult. we find a rapid increase with age in the number of random insertions and a dramatic increase in diversity. because the blood accumulates thymic output over time, blood repertoires are mixtures of different statistical recombination processes, and we unravel the mixture statistics to obtain a picture of the time evolution of the early immune system. sequence repertoire analysis also allows us to detect the statistical impact of selection on the output of the vdj recombination process. the effects we find are nearly identical between thymus and blood, suggesting that our analysis mainly detects selection for proper folding of the tcr receptor protein. we further find that selection is weaker in laboratory mice than in humans and it does not affect the diversity of the repertoire.
thermodynamics	adsorption behavior of unstable proteins, i.e., bovine serum albumin and (alpha)-lactalbumin, has been studied on a hydrophobic interaction chromatography medium under mass overloading conditions at different kosmotropic salt concentrations in the mobile phase. a mechanistic model has been formulated and used to describe kinetics and thermodynamics of protein interactions with the adsorbent surface. the model assumed two-site binding adsorption and reversible protein unfolding, which allowed predicting the inhibition of protein unfolding at high column loadings. a simplified procedure for the determination of model parameters has been developed, which was based on the inverse method. the model was successfully used to reproduce the pattern of chromatographic elution as well as the course of breakthrough curves. the model formulation was supported by nano differential scanning fluorimetry measurements, which were exploited to determine the protein stability in the liquid and adsorbed phases at different column loadings and salt concentrations.

immunology	background: celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by an accumulation of immune cells in the duodenal mucosa as a consequence of both adaptive and innate immune responses to undigested gliadin peptides. mast cells (mcs) are innate immune cells that are a major source of costimulatory signals and inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa. although mcs have previously been associated with cd, functional studies have never been performed. objective: we aimed at evaluating the role of mcs in the pathogenesis of cd. methods: intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with cd were scored according to the marsh classification and characterized for leukocyte infiltration and mc distribution. moreover, mc reactivity to gliadin and its peptides was characterized by using in vitro assays. results: infiltrating mcs were associated with the severity of mucosal damage, and their numbers were increased in patients with higher marsh scores. mcs were found to directly respond to nonimmunodominant gliadin fragments by releasing proinflammatory mediators. immunohistochemical characterization of infiltrating mcs and the effects of gliadin peptides on intestinal mcs indicated an increase in proinflammatory mc function in advanced stages of the disease. this was also associated with increased neutrophil accumulation, the prevalence of m1 macrophages, and the severity of tissue damage. conclusion: we provide a description of the progressive stages of cd, in which mcs are the hallmark of the inflammatory process. thus the view of cd should be revised, and the contribution of mcs in the onset and progression of cd should be reconsidered in developing new therapeutic approaches.
fluid_mechanics	hydrodynamic performance of the marine mussel, mytilus galloprovincialis, is studied with time-resolved particle image velocimetry. we evaluated inhalant flow, exhalant jet flow, suction performance and flow control capabilities of the mussels quantitatively. inhalant flow structures of mussels are measured at the coronal plane for the first time in literature. nutrient fluid is convected into the mussel by three-dimensional sink flow. inhalant velocity reaches its highest magnitude inside the mussel mantle while it is accelerating outward from the mussels. we calculated pressure gradient at the coronal plane. as inhalant flow approaches the mussel shell tip, suction force generated by the inhalant flow increases and becomes significant at the shell tip. likewise, exhalant jet flow regimes were studied for 17 mussels. mussels can control their exhalant jet flow structure from a single potential core region to double potential core region or vice versa. peak exhalant jet velocity generated by the mussels changes between 2.77 cm s(-1) and 11.1 cm s(-1) as a function of mussel cavity volume. measurements of hydrodynamic dissipation at the sagittal plane revealed no interaction between the inhalant and exhalant jet flow, indicating energy-efficient synchronized pumping mechanism. this efficient pumping mechanismis associated with the flow-turning angle between inhalant and exhalant jet flows, similar to 90 degrees (s.d. 12 degrees).
northern_blotting	based on the significant differences in the resistance to sclerotinia sclerotiorum between two brassica napus cultivars, zhongr888 and zhongyou821, near isogenic lines (nils) were established. the resistance differences between zhongyou821 and bc5 progeny (the fifth generation from a cross between zhongyou821 and zhongr888 with zhongyou821 as successive backcross parent) was displayed by cdna-aflp and differential transcripts-derived fragments (tdfs). the full-length cdna of 1,707 bp with 1,323 bp open reading frame (orf, open box), named rsk was identified by rt-race from the resistance related fragment 40-2 in zhongyou821. it encoded a protein of 440 amino acid residues, which contained a putative extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of rsk revealed that it had high homology to arabidopsis thaliana kinase involved in protein binding, and had a conserved region of lrr-ri, indicating it might be a member of leucine-rich repeats, ribonuclease inhibitor-like subfamily. dna sequences of 1,685 bp and 1,703 bp without an intron were also identified from zhongyou821 and bc5, respectively. expression analysis showed that rsk might play a role in disease resistance pathways.
human_metabolism	a $600 million nutritional supplements market growing at 30% every year attests to consumer awareness of, and interests in, health benefits attributed to these supplements. for over 80years the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) consumption for human health has been established. the fda recently approved the use of -3 pufas in supplements. additionally, the market for -3 pufa ingredients grew by 24.3% last year, which affirms their popularity and public awareness of their benefits. pufas are essential for normal human growth; however, only minor quantities of the beneficial -3 pufas eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) are synthesized by human metabolism. rather pufas are obtained via dietary or nutritional supplementation and modified into other beneficial metabolites. a vast literature base is available on the health benefits and biological roles of -3 pufas and their metabolism; however, information on their dietary sources and palatability of foods incorporated with -3 pufas is limited. dha and epa are added to many foods that are commercially available, such as infant and pet formulae, and they are also supplemented in animal feed to incorporate them in consumer dairy, meat, and poultry products. the chief sources of epa and dha are fish oils or purified preparations from microalgae, which when added to foods, impart a fishy flavor that is considered unacceptable. this fishy flavor is completely eliminated by extensively purifying preparations of n-3 pufa sources. while n-3 pufa lipid autoxidation is considered the main cause of fishy flavor, the individual oxidation products identified thus far, such as unsaturated carbonyls, do not appear to contribute to fishy flavor or odor. alternatively, various compound classes such as free fatty acids and volatile sulfur compounds are known to impart fishy flavor to foods. identification of the causative compounds to reduce and eventually eliminate fishy flavor is important for consumer acceptance of pufa-fortified foods.
cell_biology	molecular ecologists have good reasons to be excited about the newest dna/rna sequencing technologies. however, this exuberance should be tempered with a hefty dose of reality: new sequencing technologies come with significant new challenges. herein, we offer a brief overview of some practical problems encountered during transcriptomics studies conducted in our laboratory, and of nontrivial issues that prospective practitioners should consider. these include template contamination (e.g. from xenobiotics) and the cutting-room floor problem, whereby most of the data are often unassembled, unannotated and unused. we also highlight computational requirements, including hardware, personnel time and associated skill sets. we are very optimistic about the future of molecular ecology, but we hope this cautionary overview will help neophytes better recognize some key challenges associated with new technologies.
genetics	eimeria maxima is one of the most pathogenic species of avian coccidia, yet it is unknown why different e. maxima strains differ in the pathogenic effects they cause in chickens. the purpose of this study was to determine if a more pathogenic e. maxima strain (apu1) was also more fecund than a less pathogenic e. maxima strain (apu2). at identical doses, e. maxima apu1 always produces greater intestinal lesions and lower weight gain compared to e. maxima apu2. using a dose response study, median and mean intestinal lesion scores in e. maxima apu2-infected chickens were greater by a score of 1-1.5 compared to chickens infected with e. maxima apu2. likewise, weight gain depression in e. maxima apu1-infected chickens was 20-25% greater (equivalent to 110-130 g body weight) than in e. maxima apu2-infected chickens. in order to understand the underlying cause of these observed clinical effects, 120 broiler chicks (5 oocyst levels, 6 replicates/level) were inoculated with various doses of e. maxima apu1 or apu2 oocysts. the dynamics of oocyst shedding was investigated by collecting fecal material every 12 h from 114 to 210 h post-inoculation (p.i.) and every 24 h thereafter from 210 to 306 h, and then processed for measuring e. maxima oocyst output. oocysts were first observed at 138 h p.i., and time of peak oocyst production was nearly identical for both e. maxima apu1 and apu2 around 150-162 h. total oocyst production was 1.1-2.6 fold higher at all dose levels for e. maxima apu1 compared to e. maxima apu2, being significantly higher (p <0.05) at the log 1.5 dose level. other groups of chickens were infected with higher doses of e. maxima apu1 or apu2 oocysts, and intestinal lesions were assessed by histology at 72, 96, 120, and 144h p.i. although schizonts, gamonts, and oocysts were observed at expected time-points, no obvious differences were noted in lesions induced by the two e. maxima strains. this study showed that the greater fecundity of e. maxima apu1 compared to e. maxima apu2 explains in part the observed differences in pathogenicity of the two e. maxima strains, but that other factors may contribute to differences in observed clinical effects.
human_metabolism	we propose a computationally efficient probabilistic modeling, methodology to estimate the adverse effects on humans of exposure to contaminated groundwater. our work is aligned with the standard suggested by the regulatory agencies and allows to propagate uncertainty from hydrogeological, toxicological and behavioral parameters to the final health risk endpoint. the problem under consideration consists of a contaminated aquifer supplying water to a population. contamination stems from a continuous source that feeds a steady plume which constitutes the hazard source. this scenario is particularly suited for napl pollutants. the erratic displacement of the contaminant plume in groundwater, due to the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, is characterized within the lagrangian stochastic framework which enables the complete probabilistic characterization of the contaminant concentration at an environmentally sensitive location. following the probabilistic characterization of flow and transport, we quantify the adverse health effects on humans. the dose response assessment involves the estimation of the uncertain effects of the exposure to a given contaminant while accounting for the exposed individual 's metabolism. the model integrates groundwater transport, exposure and human metabolism in a comprehensive probabilistic framework which allows the assessment of the risk probability through a novel simple analytical solution. aside from its computational efficiency, the analytical features of the framework allows the assessment of uncertainty arising from the hydrogeological parameters.

fluid_mechanics	quantitative evaluation of the shear threshold on c. tinctorius l. cell growth is vital for bioreactor system design and optimization of scaled-up industrial cultivation. the present research focused on investigating the effects of shear force on c. tinctorius l cell growth by computational fluid dynamic (cfd) analysis in shaken flasks. the results revealed that specific cell growth rates were greatly inhibited as the shear force increased from 1.17 to 2.42 pa. recovery of viability and aggregation diameter to their normal levels could be implemented after a 4-day adaptation with large fluctuations in physiological state. with further correlation analysis on shear force and c. tinctorius l. growth rate, a threshold value was identified at an average and maximum shear stress of approximately 0.55 pa (0.06 w/kg) and 4.00 pa (0.93 w/kg) according to the influence on cell growth. quantitative data on shear effects can facilitate the design of industrial processes and lead to more rational scale-up in industrial c. tinctorius l cultivation.

machine_design	this research introduces a novel magnetically isolated phase structure for switched reluctance motor, namely, as septi-segment srm (sssrm), which is proper for high torque/volume and with lowest leakage flux in different fields of industries. the sssrm contains seven stator layers that are isolated from each other magnetically, also each of them include an assembly of 4/4 stator/rotor poles. the three layers are energized at the same time for generating higher torque with lower ripple compared with the typical srm. furthermore, this configuration results other advantages, such as easy cooling and independent phases. to evaluate the proposed motor performance, the configuration is introduced at first. secondly, the motor profiles as flux linkage, flux density, self/mutual inductance and motor torque are assessed using a 3d finite element method (3d-fem). an sssrm has been manufactured with a test bench in the laboratory, and the experimental results of the new motor and typical type were compared in the same volume and area. the results and comparative study clearly demonstrate the prominent features of the proposed motor for various applications. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
northern_blotting	the enolase2 gene is usually expressed in mature neurons and also named neuron specific enolase (nse). in the present study, we first obtained the nse gene cdna sequence by using the race method based on the expressed sequence tag (est) fragment from the cdna library of gekko japonicus and identified one transcript of about 2.2 kb in central nervous system of gekko japonicus by northern blotting. the open reading frame of nse is 1305 bp, which encodes a 435 amino-acid protein. we further investigated the multi-tissue expression pattern of nse by rt-pcr and found that the expression of nse mrna was very high in brain, spinal cord and low in heart, while it was not detectable in other tissues. the real-time quantitative pcr was used to investigate the time-dependent change in the expression of the nse mrna level after gecko spinal cord transection and found it significantly increased at one day, reaching its highest level three days post-injury and then decreasing at the seventh day of the experiment. the recombinant plasmid of pet-32a-nse was constructed and induced to express his fused nse protein. the purified nse protein was used to immunize rabbits to generate polyclonal antisera. the titer of the antiserum was more than 1:65536 determined by elisa. western blotting showed that the prepared antibody could specifically recognize the recombinant and endogenous nse protein. the result of immunohistochemistry revealed that positive signals were present in neurons of the brain and the spinal cord. this study provided the tools of cdna and polyclonal antibody for studying nse function in gekko japonicus.
internal_combustion_engine	three connecting bolts fractured, which were assembled on the fan used in the internal combustion engine. detailed fractographic study and metallurgical analysis were focused on the fractured bolts. fractographic and metallurgical studies indicate that the fracture surface and the microstructure of three bolts exhibit similar features. the fatigue fracture is the main failure mechanism of the bolts. appearance of the micro-cracks in the thread tip of the fractured bolts makes the stress at the thread regions increase intensively so that the fatigue cracks initiated from the thread regions. due to the presence of dynamic load, the bolts were never properly tightened during installation which should be responsible for the formation of the cracks.
strength_of_materials	in the present study, new quaternary mgy1.65zn0.74al0.53 and mgy3.72zn1.96al0.45 alloys (wt.%) were synthesized employing the disintegrated melt deposition (dmd) casting technique followed by hot extrusion. microstructural characterization revealed the presence of 14h long-period stacking ordered structure (lpso) and mg4y2znal3 phases aligned along the direction of extrusion in both alloys. refined grains (= 20 mu m) in the extruded microstructures. compared to monolithic mg, significant increase in the microhardness (similar to 67-88%), tensile yield strength (similar to 245-290%) and ultimate tensile strength (similar to 113-144%) were observed in the mg-y-zn-al alloys. despite the significant increase in strength of materials, failure strains of both mg-y-zn-al alloys were comparable to monolithic mg. ignition temperatures of both mg-y-zn-al alloys were found to outperform commercially available az31, az80 and we43 (high-temperature) mg alloys, and the highest ignition temperature of 770 degrees c was achieved in the mgy3.72zn1.96al0.45 alloy.

fluid_mechanics	the article presents the results of examining a wind turbine on the vertical axis of rotation. the study was conducted in an open circuit wind tunnel gunt hm 170 in the laboratory of the department of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and aviation propulsion systems at lublin university of technology. the subject of research was a rotor based on the patent pl 219985, with blades capable of altering the surface of the active area (receiving kinetic energy of the wind). the study was performed on appropriately scaled and geometrically similar models maintaining, relevant to the type of research, the criterion numbers. the studied rotors with different blade inclination angles were produced using a 3d powder printer zprinter r (r) 450. the results of the conducted research were obtained for the flow velocity of 6.5 m/s and three inclination angles, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees, at variable rotational speed. the test equipment used in the study allows maintaining the required speed, recording velocity and torque, which in turn allows an engineer to measure such characteristics of torque and power as a function of rotor speed.
enzymology	background: chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide on earth and as such a great target for bioconversion applications. the phylum bacteroidetes is one of nature 's most ubiquitous bacterial lineages and is essential in the global carbon cycle with many members being highly efficient degraders of complex carbohydrates. however, despite their specialist reputation in carbohydrate conversion, mechanisms for degrading recalcitrant crystalline polysaccharides such as chitin and cellulose are hitherto unknown. results: here we describe a complete functional analysis of a novel polysaccharide utilization locus (pul) in the soil bacteroidete flavobacterium johnsoniae, tailored for conversion of chitin. the f. johnsoniae chitin utilization locus (chiul) consists of eleven contiguous genes encoding carbohydrate capture and transport proteins, enzymes, and a two-component sensor-regulator system. the key chitinase (chia) encoded by chiul is atypical in terms of known bacteroidetes-affiliated pul mechanisms as it is not anchored to the outer cell membrane and consists of multiple catalytic domains. we demonstrate how the extraordinary hydrolytic efficiency of chia derives from synergy between its multiple chitinolytic (endo-and exo-acting) and previously unidentified chitin-binding domains. reverse genetics show that chia and pul-encoded proteins involved in sugar binding, import, and chitin sensing are essential for efficient chitin utilization. surprisingly, the chiul encodes two pairs of susc/d-like outer membrane proteins. ligand-binding and structural studies revealed functional differences between the two susd-like proteins that enhance scavenging of chitin from the environment. the combined results from this study provide insight into the mechanisms employed by bacteroidetes to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides and reveal important novel aspects of the pul paradigm. conclusions: by combining reverse genetics to map essential pul genes, structural studies on outer membrane chitin-binding proteins, and enzymology, we provide insight into the mechanisms employed by bacteroidetes to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides and introduce a new saccharolytic mechanism used by the phylum bacteroidetes. the presented discovery and analysis of the chiul will greatly benefit future enzyme discovery efforts as well as studies regarding enzymatic intramolecular synergism.
genetics	dams fragment aquatic networks and impact the evolutionary dynamics of migratory fish populations. historically, the lake pend oreille-lower clark fork river system in idaho and montana supported a large metapopulation of adfluvial westslope cutthroat trout (westslope). these fish matured in the lake and made upstream spawning migrations to their natal tributaries in the river. currently, dams allow downstream passage for juvenile fish to the lake, but no upstream passage for adults. we examined 19 microsatellite and anonymous nuclear loci to characterize spatial patterns of non-native rainbow trout (rainbow) genetic introgression in westslope populations upstream and downstream of these dams. we detected hybridization at 20 of 42 sites sampled throughout the system, with rainbow introgression ranging from 1.1 to 99.8%. rainbow introgression was higher in tributaries downstream of both dams (12 of 18 sites downstream vs 6 of 22 sites upstream). within tributaries, hybrids were more common in lower sections and only one sampled site contained a hybrid swarm. fish collected below both dams during the spawning migration were admixtures of westslope, rainbows and hybrids with an average rainbow introgression of 48%. phenotypic criteria reduced rainbow introgression to less than 1% for putative westslope identified for selective upstream transport at both dams. lack of upstream fish passage at these dams has likely constrained spread of hybridization and increased isolation among non-hybridized westslope populations by reducing the abundance of the migratory life history form in areas upstream of these dams.
northern_blotting	fusarium wilt, caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (foc), is among the most destructive diseases of banana (musa spp.). because no credible control measures are available, development of resistant cultivars through genetic engineering is the only option. we investigated whether intron hairpin rna (ihprna)-mediated expression of small interfering rnas (sirnas) targeted against vital fungal genes (velvet and fusarium transcription factor 1) in transgenic banana could achieve effective resistance against foc. partial sequences of these two genes were assembled as ihprnas in suitable binary vectors (ihprna-vel and ihprna-ftf1) and transformed into embryogenic cell suspensions of banana cv. rasthali by agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. eleven transformed lines derived from ihprna-vel and twelve lines derived from ihprna-ftf1 were found to be free of external and internal symptoms of foc after 6-week-long greenhouse bioassays. the five selected transgenic lines for each construct continued to resist foc at 8 months postinoculation. presence of specific sirnas derived from the two ihprnas in transgenic banana plants was confirmed by northern blotting and illumina sequencing of small rnas derived from the transgenic banana plants. the present study represents an important effort in proving that host-induced post-transcriptional ihprna-mediated gene silencing of vital fungal genes can confer efficient resistance against debilitating pathogens in crop plants.
immunology	high-throughput screening (hts) is currently the mainstay for the identification of chemical entities capable of modulating biochemical reactions or cellular processes. with the advancement of biotechnologies and the high translational potential of small molecules, a number of innovative approaches in drug discovery have evolved, which explains the resurgent interest in the use of hts. the oncology field is currently the most active research area for drug screening, with no major breakthrough made for the identification of new immunomodulatory compounds targeting transplantation-related complications or autoimmune ailments. here, we present a novel in vitro murine fluorescent-based lymphocyte assay easily adapted for the identification of new immunomodulatory compounds. this assay uses t or b cells derived from a transgenic mouse, in which the nur77 promoter drives gfp expression upon t-or b-cell receptor stimulation. as the gfp intensity reflects the activation/ transcriptional activity of the target cell, our assay defines a novel tool to study the effect of given compound(s) on cellular/biological responses. for instance, a primary screening was performed using 4,398 compounds in the absence of a ""target hypothesis"", which led to the identification of 160 potential hits displaying immunomodulatory activities. thus, the use of this assay is suitable for drug discovery programs exploring large chemical libraries prior to further in vitro/in vivo validation studies.
materials_engineering	a new open-source project evaluation tool, entitled the materials engineering tetrahedron (met), has been developed to determine the economic viability of materials design, selection, processing, and validation costs associated with any infrastructure-based project. met improves project design by providing an economic perspective to the traditional materials science tetrahedron, relating microstructure, processing, property, and performance through the introduction of value-based economic costs for each side of the tetrahedron. the resulting size and distortion, from a regular tetrahedron illustrates the balance between the system, component, or material fabrication project detailed. the met model also allows for increased budget efficiency and the potential for improved identification of cost saving mechanisms. the use of financial tools, such met, will aid engineering project management by providing easy and reliable metrics to compare projected costs versus desired outcomes. expansion and use of these types of tools will reduce risks during the initial stages of project design. to illustrate the strength of met, several example tetrahedra were generated demonstrating the various uses and applications of this new program.
southern_blotting	immortalized human precartilaginous stem cells (ipscs) were established to provide stable cell resource for the study of the molecular mechanism of gene targeting on the differentiation of pscs. plasmid pcmvsv40t/pur containing simian virus 40 large t antigen gene (sv40tag) was transfected into human pscs by using lipofectin transfection. colonies were isolated by puromycin selection and expanded by multiple passages. immunohistochemistry, rt-pcr and southern blotting were used to identify the transfected cells and to detect the expression and integration of sv40tag in expanded cell lines. the positive colonies were isolated and subcultured, designated immortalized precartilaginous stem cells (ipscs), which were confirmed as fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (fgfr-3) positive cells by immunohistochemistry and rt-pcr. sv40tag cdna was found in cultured ipscs of passage 8 by southern blotting, and the expressions of sv40tag mrna and protein were confirmed by rt-pcr. these findings suggested that ipscs strain with sv40tag was constructed successfully.
computer-aided_design	new advanced manufacturing technologies under the alias of additive biomanufacturing allow the design and fabrication of a range of products from pre-operative models, cutting guides and medical devices to scaffolds. the process of printing in 3 dimensions of cells, extracellular matrix (ecm) and biomaterials (bioinks, powders, etc.) to generate in vitro and/or in vivo tissue analogue structures has been termed bioprinting. to further advance in additive biomanufacturing, there are many aspects that we can learn from the wider additive manufacturing (am) industry, which have progressed tremendously since its introduction into the manufacturing sector. first, this review gives an overview of additive manufacturing and both industry and academia efforts in addressing specific challenges in the am technologies to drive toward am-enabled industrial revolution. after which, considerations of poly(lactides) as a biomaterial in additive biomanufacturing are discussed. challenges in wider additive biomanufacturing field are discussed in terms of (a) biomaterials; (b) computer-aided design, engineering and manufacturing; (c) am and additive biomanufacturing printers hardware; and (d) system integration. finally, the outlook for additive biomanufacturing was discussed.

strength_of_materials	in the high speed sliding electrical contact with large current, the temperature of contact area rises quickly under the coupling action of the friction heating, the joule heating and electric arc heating. the rising temperature seriously affects the conductivity of the components and the yield strength of materials, as well affects the contact state and lead to damage, so as to shorten the service life of the contact elements. therefore, there is vital significance to measure the temperature accurately and investigate the temperature effect on damage of rail surface. aiming at the problem of components damage in high speed sliding electrical contact, the transient heat effect on the contact surface was explored and its influence and regularity on the sliding components damage was obtained. a kind of real-time temperature measurement method on rail surface of high speed sliding electrical contact is proposed. under the condition of 2.5 ka current load, based on the principle of infrared radiation non-contact temperature sensor was used to measure the rail temperature. the dynamic distribution of temperature field was obtained through the simulation analysis, further, the connection between temperature changes and the rail surface damage morphology, the damage volume was analyzed and established. finally, the method to reduce rail damage and improve the life of components by changing the temperature field was discussed.
cell_biology	synthetic binding proteins are constructed using nonantibody molecular scaffolds. over the last two decades, in-depth structural and functional analyses of synthetic binding proteins have improved combinatorial library designs and selection strategies, which have resulted in potent platforms that consistently generate binding proteins to diverse targets with affinity and specificity that rival those of antibodies. favorable attributes of synthetic binding proteins, such as small size, freedom from disulfide bond formation and ease of making fusion proteins, have enabled their unique applications in protein science, cell biology and beyond. here, we review recent studies that illustrate how synthetic binding proteins are powerful probes that can directly link structure and function, often leading to new mechanistic insights. we propose that synthetic proteins will become powerful standard tools in diverse areas of protein science, biotechnology and medicine.
immunology	in recent years, the myocardium has been rediscovered under the lenses of immunology, and lymphocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies with different etiologies. aging is an important risk factor for heart diseases, and it also has impact on the immune system. thus, we sought to determine whether immunological activity would influence myocardial structure and function in elderly mice. morphological, functional, and molecular analyses revealed that the age-related myocardial impairment occurs in parallel with shifts in the composition of tissue-resident leukocytes and with an accumulation of activated cd4+ foxp3(-)(forkhead box p3) ifn-gamma(+) t cells in the heart-draining lymph nodes. a comprehensive characterization of different aged immune-deficient mouse strains revealed that t cells significantly contribute to age-related myocardial inflammation and functional decline. upon adoptive cell transfer, the t cells isolated from the mediastinal lymph node (med-ln) of aged animals exhibited increased cardiotropism, compared with cells purified from young donors or from other irrelevant sites. nevertheless, these cells caused rather mild effects on cardiac functionality, indicating that myocardial aging might stem from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic (immunological) factors. taken together, the data herein presented indicate that heart-directed immune responses may spontaneously arise in the elderly, even in the absence of a clear tissue damage or concomitant infection. these observations might shed new light on the emerging role of t cells in myocardial diseases, which primarily affect the elderly population.
molecular_biology	as bacterial resistance becomes increasingly common, a new hybrid peptide, cecropina-magainin (kwalskegpgkflgkkkkf), has been developed that can kill a broad spectrum of bacteria without damaging human cells. the mechanism of antibacterial toxicity for the hybrid peptides is unknown. herein, we investigate the localization of the hybrid peptide in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the minimum inhibitory concentration was 64 mu g/ml. the hybrid peptides could enhance the hydrophobicity of mrsa. dye leakage experiments showed that the hybrid peptides caused dye leakage from liposomes. the hybrid peptides influenced the permeability of the outer membrane and plasma membrane of mrsa. after cecropina-magainin treatment of mrsa, the membrane ultrastructure was damaged and the concentration of k+ increased. ultimately, the peptide destroyed the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, allowing the dye propidium iodide to enter the cytoplasm. therefore, the hybrid antibacterial peptide can kill mrsa.

enzymology	human 8-oxoguanine dna glycosylase (ogg1) excises the mutagenic oxidative dna lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxog) from dna. kinetic characterization of ogg1 is undertaken to measure the rates of 8-oxog excision and product release. when the ogg1 concentration is lower than substrate dna, time courses of product formation are biphasic; a rapid exponential phase (i.e. burst) of product formation is followed by a linear steady-state phase. the initial burst of product formation corresponds to the concentration of enzyme properly engaged on the substrate, and the burst amplitude depends on the concentration of enzyme. the first-order rate constant of the burst corresponds to the intrinsic rate of 8-oxog excision and the slower steady-state rate measures the rate of product release (product dna dissociation rate constant, k(off)). here, we describe steady-state, pre-steady-state, and single-turnover approaches to isolate and measure specific steps during ogg1 catalytic cycling. a fluorescent labeled lesion-containing oligonucleotide and purified ogg1 are used to facilitate precise kinetic measurements. since low enzyme concentrations are used to make steady-state measurements, manual mixing of reagents and quenching of the reaction can be performed to ascertain the steady-state rate (k(off)). additionally, extrapolation of the steady-state rate to a point on the ordinate at zero time indicates that a burst of product formation occurred during the first turnover (i.e. y-intercept is positive). the first-order rate constant of the exponential burst phase can be measured using a rapid mixing and quenching technique that examines the amount of product formed at short time intervals (s). these approaches can measure elementary rate constants that influence the efficiency of removal of a dna lesion.
computer-aided_design	composite resin blocks for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) applications have recently become available. however, cad/cam composite resins have lower wear resistance and accumulate more plaque than cad/cam ceramic materials. we assessed the effects of sio2-nanocomposite film coating of four types of cad/cam composite resin blocks: cerasmart, katana avencia block, lava ultimate, and block hc on surface hardness and bacterial attachment. all composite blocks with coating demonstrated significantly greater vickers hardness, reduced surface roughness, and greater hydrophobicity than those without coating. adhesion of streptococcus mutans to the coated specimens was significantly less than those for the uncoated specimens. these reduced levels of bacterial adherence on the coated surface were still evident after treatment with saliva. surface modification by sio2-nanocomposite film coating has potential to improve wear resistance and susceptibility to plaque accumulation of cad/cam composite resin restorations.
human_metabolism	astrocytes are important for normal brain functioning. astrocytes are metabolic regulators of the brain that exert many functions such as the preservation of blood-brain barrier (bbb) function, clearance of toxic substances, and generation of antioxidant molecules and growth factors. these functions are fundamental to sustain the function and survival of neurons and other brain cells. for these reasons, the protection of astrocytes has become relevant for the prevention of neuronal death during brain pathologies such as parkinson 's disease, alzheimer 's disease, stroke, and other neurodegenerative conditions. currently, different strategies are being used to protect the main astrocytic functions during neurological diseases, including the use of growth factors, steroid derivatives, mesenchymal stem cell paracrine factors, nicotine derivatives, and computational biology tools. moreover, the combined use of experimental approaches with bioinformatics tools such as the ones obtained through system biology has allowed a broader knowledge in astrocytic protection both in normal and pathological conditions. in the present review, we highlight some of these recent paradigms in assessing astrocyte protection using experimental and computational approaches and discuss how they could be used for the study of restorative therapies for the brain in pathological conditions.
immunology	inadequate access to prevention and medical treatment for female sex workers (sw) represents a challenge for the german health system. accessibility and care for sw in bochum (germany) through a cooperation between the interdisciplinary immunology outpatient clinic, center for sexual health and medicine of st. josef 's hospital, the bochum health department and the madonna e.v. was the focus of this work. medical outreach services were provided for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (sti) in sw in brothels in bochum between august 2013 and january 2014. after clarification and verbal consent from the sw, free hiv, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis tests were offered and carried out using pseudonyms for the sw. a total of 112 sw were reached (up to 55.4 % within the framework of the sti outreach study). of the sw, 94.6 % had an immigrant background. the majority (61.3 %) of sw were between 20 und 29 years old. only 19.0 % of the collective had health insurance. the following stis were diagnosed: 12.5 % chlamydia, 6.2 % syphilis, 3.6 % gonorrhea, 3.6 % trichomoniasis, and 0.9 % hiv. these results were compared with results from sti studies in sw in germany. treatment was performed in accordance with the standards of the german sti society. the offer improved the accessibility and the utilization of medical services by sw in bochum. a further improvement of services is urgently needed.
thermodynamics	this study aimed to investigate the formation of three inclusion complexes of laccaic acid a (the main component of the lac dye, named as la) with beta-cyclodextrin(beta-cd), methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (m -beta-cd), or (2-hydroxyethyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (hp -beta-cd), exploring particularly the effects of cds on the solubility of la and the binding ability of the final inclusion coitiplexes. lac dye, a natural colorant, had been widely used in food and textile industry. because of its low water solubility, the application of this nontoxic dye was restricted. this study employed beta-cyclodextrin and its derivatives to encapsulate the hydrophobic part of la and resolve the aforementioned limitation. the binding constants (k-c) and solubility of la were determined with the three beta-cds using the phase-solubility method, which followed the rank order of hp-beta-cd>m -beta-cd >beta-cd. the inclusion interactions between la and,beta-cds were detected using the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and h-1 nuclear magnetic resonance. moreover, the scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope were applied to characterize the appearance of the inclusion complexes. this study would provide a useful approach for obtaining novel la-based products with high water solubility and low toxicity.

northern_blotting	the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase, encoded by pnp) is a major player in bacterial rna decay. in escherichia coli, pnpase expression is post-transcriptionally regulated at the level of mrna stability. the primary transcript is very efficiently processed by the endonuclease rnase iii at a specific site and the processed pnp mrna is rapidly degraded in a pnpase-dependent manner. while investigating the pnpase autoregulation mechanism we found, by uv-cross-linking experiments, that the ribosomal protein s1 in crude extracts binds to the pnp-mrna leader region. we assayed the potential role of s1 protein in pnp gene regulation by modulating s1 expression from depletion to overexpression. we found that s1 depletion led to a sharp decrease of the amount of pnp and other tested mrnas, as detected by northern blotting, whereas s1 overexpression caused a strong stabilization of pnp and the other transcripts. surprisingly, mrna stabilization depended on pnpase, as it was not observed in a pnp deletion strain. pnpase-dependent stabilization, however, was not detected by chemical decay assay of bulk mrna. overall, our data suggest that pnpase exonucleolytic activity may be modulated by the translation potential of the target mrnas and that, upon ribosomal protein s1 overexpression, pnpase protects from degradation a set of full-length mrnas. it thus appears that a single mrna species may be differentially targeted to either decay or pnpase-dependent stabilization, thus preventing its depletion in conditions of fast turnover.
immunology	p53 was reported to be an attractive immunotherapy target because it is mutated in approximately half of human cancers, resulting in its inactivation and often accumulation in tumor cells. peptides derived from p53 are presented by class i mhc molecules and may act as tumor-associated epitopes which could be targeted by p53-specific t cells. interestingly, it was recently shown that there is a lack of significant correlation between p53 expression levels in tumors and their recognition by p53-tcr transduced t cells. to better understand the influence of the mutational status of p53 on its presentation by the mhc system and on t cell antitumor reactivity, we generated several mutant p53 constructs and expressed them in hla-a2(+)/p53(-) cells. upon co-culture with p53-specific t cells, we measured the specific recognition of p53-expressing target cells by means of cytokine secretion, marker upregulation and cytotoxicity, and in parallel determined p53 expression levels by intracellular staining. we also examined the relevance of antigen presentation components on p53 recognition and the impact of mutant p53 expression on cell-cycle dynamics. our results show that selected p53 mutations altering protein stability can modulate p53 presentation to t cells, leading to a differential immune reactivity inversely correlated with measured p53 protein levels. thus, p53 may behave differently than other classical tumor antigens and its mutational status should therefore be taken into account when elaborating immunotherapy treatments of cancer patients targeting p53.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background/objectives: although the antioxidative effects of lycopene are generally known, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of lycopene are not fully elucidated. this study aimed to examine the role and mechanism of lycopene as an inhibitor of inflammation. methods/materials: lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated sw 480 human colorectal cancer cells were treated with 0, 10, 20, and 30 pm lycopene. the mtt assay was performed to determine the effects of lycopene on cell proliferation. western blotting was performed to observe the expression of inflammation-related proteins, including nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b), inhibitor kappa b (i kappa b), mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), extracellular signal-related kinase (erk), c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk), and p38 (p38 map kinase). real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to investigate the mrna expression of tumor necrosis factor a (tnf-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2). concentrations of nitric oxide (no) and prostaglandin e-2 (pge(2)) were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. results: in cells treated with lycopene and lps, the mrna expression of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, inos, and cox-2 were decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). the concentrations of pge2 and no decreased according to the lycopene concentration (p < 0.05). the protein expressions of nf-kappa b and jnk were decreased significantly according to lycopene concertation (p < 0.05). conclusions: lycopene restrains nf-kappa b and jnk activation, which causes inflammation, and suppresses the expression of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, cox-2, and inos in sw480 human colorectal cancer cells.
materials_engineering	advances in nanotechnology have enabled the production and characterization of magnetic nano-particles with nanometer-sized features that can be functionalized with material sciences for bio engineering and materials engineering etc. the iron oxides and iron oxide with other compounds are of importance in fields including biomedicine, clinical and bio-sensing applications, corrosion resistance, lubrication and magnetic properties of materials, catalyst, and geochemical processes etc. the magnetic nano-sized iron oxide particles was synthesized by the co-precipitation method from fecl2 center dot 4h(2)o and fecl3 center dot 6h(2)o dissolved in deionized water with vigorous stirring. it was added organic components in the solution for preventing of agglomeration of particles during synthesizing. the magnetite nanoparticles were obtained by two ways: at first by adding glycerin to the solution; second - continue stirring throughout the slow addition of fine powder of sodium oleate. it shows that the ferro-fluid with additional glycerin component and it is contained heterogeneous agglomerations of iron oxide particles with bubbled structure. while solution is added sodium oleate components, it has uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the liquid solution.
hydraulics	elevated forest mortality has been attributed to climate change-induced droughts, but prediction of spatial mortality patterns remains challenging. we evaluated whether introducing plant hydraulics and topographic convergence-induced soil moisture variation to land surface models (lsm) can help explain spatial patterns of mortality. a scheme predicting plant hydraulic safety loss from soil moisture was developed using field measurements and a plant physiology-hydraulics model, trees. the scheme was upscaled to populus tremuloides forests across colorado, usa, using lsm-modeled and topographymediated soil moisture, respectively. the spatial patterns of hydraulic safety loss were compared against aerial surveyed mortality. incorporating hydraulic safety loss raised the explanatory power of mortality by 40% compared to lsm-modeled soil moisture. topographic convergence was mostly influential in suppressing mortality in low and concave areas, explaining an additional 10% of the variations in mortality for those regions. plant hydraulics integrated water stress along the soil-plant continuum and was more closely tied to plant physiological response to drought. in addition to the well-recognized topo-climate influence due to elevation and aspect, we found evidence that topographic convergence mediates tree mortality in certain parts of the landscape that are low and convergent, likely through influences on plant-available water.
southern_blotting	transgenic technology has been successfully used for gene function analyses and trait improvement in cereal plants. however, its usage is limited in woody plants, especially in the difficult-to-transform but commercially viable hybrid poplar. in this work, an efficient regeneration and transformation system was established for the production of two hybrid aspen clones: populus alba x p. berolinensis and populus davidiana x p. bolleana. a plant transformation vector designed to express the reporter gene uida, encoding beta-glucuronidase (gus), driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter, was used to detect transformation event at early stages of plant regeneration, and to optimize the parameters that may affect poplar transformation efficiency. bacterium strain and age of leaf explant are two major factors that affect transformation efficiency. addition of thidiazuron (tdz) improved both regeneration and transformation efficiency. the transformation efficiency is approximately 9.3% for p. alba x p. berolinensis and 16.4% for p. davidiana x p. bolleana. using this system, transgenic plants were usually produced in less than 1 month after co-cultivation. the growth characteristics and morphology of transgenic plants were identical to the untransformed wild type plants, and the transgenes could be inherited by vegetative propagation, as confirmed by pcr, southern blotting, rt-pcr and beta-glucuronidase staining analyses. the establishment of this system will help to facilitate the studies of gene functions in tree growth and development at a genome level, and as well as the introduction of some valuable traits in aspen breeding.
genetics	study question: do genetic effects regulate gene expression in human endometrium? summary answer:this study demonstrated strong genetic effects on endometrial gene expression and some evidence for genetic regulation of gene expression in a menstrual cycle stage-specific manner. what is known already:genetic effects on expression levels for many genes are tissue specific. endometrial gene expression varies across menstrual cycle stages and between individuals, but there are limited data on genetic control of expression in endometrium. study design, size, duration:we analysed genome-wide genotype and gene expression data to map cis expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) in endometrium. participants/materials, setting, methods:we recruited 123 women of european ancestry. dna samples from blood were genotyped on illumina humancoreexome chips. total rna was extracted from endometrial tissues. whole-transcriptome profiles were characterized using illumina human ht-12 v4.0 expression beadchips. we performed eqtl mapping with similar to 8 000 000 genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and 12 329 genes. main results and the role of chance:we identified a total of 18 595 cis snp-probe associations at a study-wide level of significance (p < 1 x 10(-7)), which correspond to independent eqtls for 198 unique genes. the eqtls with the largest effect in endometrial tissue were rs4902335 for churc1 (p = 1.05 x 10(-32)) and rs147253019 for zp3 (p = 8.22 x 10(-30)). we further performed a context-specific eqtl analysis to investigate if genetic effects on gene expression regulation act in a menstrual cycle-specific manner. interestingly, five cis-eqtls were identified with a significant stage-by-genotype interaction. the strongest stage interaction was the eqtl for c10orf33 (pyroxd2) with snp rs2296438 (p = 2.0 x 10(-4)), where we observe a 2-fold difference in the average expression levels of heterozygous samples depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle. large scale data:the summary eqtl results are publicly available to browse or download. limitations, reasons for caution:a limitation of the present study was the relatively modest sample size. it was not powered to identify trans-eqtls and larger sample sizes will also be needed to provide better power to detect cis-eqtls and cycle stage-specific effects, given the substantial changes in expression across the menstrual cycle for many genes. wider implications of the findings:identification of endometrial eqtls provides a platform for better understanding genetic effects on endometriosis risk and other endometrial-related pathologies. study funding/competing interest(s):funding for this work was provided by nhmrc project grants gnt1026033, gnt1049472, gnt1046880, gnt1050208, gnt1105321 and app1083405. there are no competing interests.
northern_blotting	two genotypes showing differential immunity against karnal bunt (tilletia indica) were used to investigate the role of three members of cystatin gene family in growth stage dependent immunity in wheat (triticum aestivum l.). three members of cystatin gene family (wc1, wc2, and wc4) were cloned and sequenced. analysis of sequenced data showed that there was 76-99% nucleotide and protein sequence identity between different genes of the wheat cystatin. in silico amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of a conserved signature pattern of residues and also the functional domains were presumed to be actively involved in imparting cysteine protease inhibition capability. the semi-quantitative and quantitative levels of these members were measured by means of rt-pcr, northern blotting, western blotting, and by elisa techniques. the members of cystatin gene family were expressed in both resistant (hd 29) and susceptible genotypes (wh 542); however, the expression level was significantly (p0.05) in contrary to wc1 family whose expression gradually increased from s-v to s-2 stage. according to the intensity of the detected band in rt pcr, northern blot and western blot, wc1 family seems to be expressed more than the other gene families. the immunoassay results further showed that wc1 protein was abundantly expressed in resistant genotype and high expression was observed at the s2 stage as compared to susceptible genotype (p < 0.001) suggesting that low level of expression of wc1 in s2 stage is responsible for kb infection. the results of the present study clearly indicate the role of cystatin gene family in differential and stage dependent immunity against kb.
southern_blotting	salinity is an adverse environmental stress that limits the yield and quality of maize. as one of the most important osmolytes present in higher plants, glycinebetaine helps stabilize metabolism in plant cells and protects the constituents of cells from damage. in this study, a gene from atriplex micrantha that encodes betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase was introduced by agrobacterium-mediated transformation into maize inbred lines zheng58 and qi319 under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. putative transgenic plants were confirmed by pcr and southern blotting analysis. the transgenic maize plants expressed higher amounts of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and also grew better than the wt plants under nacl stress. compared with the wild type, the transgenic plants had increased fresh weight, lower malondialdehyde content, lower relative electrical conductivity, higher chlorophyll content, taller plant height, and higher grain yield under salt stress, which indicated that the expression of badh gene in maize seedlings enhanced the salt tolerance of these plants.
polymerase_chain_reaction	streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, can gain access to the bloodstream and has been associated with cardiovascular disease. however, the roles of s.mutans in inflammation in cardiovascular disease remain unclear. the aim of this study was to examine cytokine production induced by s.mutans in human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) and to evaluate the participation of toll-like receptors (tlrs) and cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) -like receptors in haecs. cytokine production by haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and the expression of tlrs and nod-like receptors was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. the involvement of tlr2 and nod2 in cytokine production by invaded haecs was examined using rna interference. the invasion efficiencies of s.mutans strains were evaluated by means of antibiotic protection assays. five of six strains of s.mutans of various serotypes induced interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production by haecs. all s.mutans strains upregulated tlr2 and nod2 mrna levels in haecs. streptococcus mutans xc upregulated the intracellular tlr2 and nod2 protein levels in haecs. silencing of the tlr2 and nod2 genes in haecs invaded by s.mutans xc led to a reduction in interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production. cytokine production induced by invasive s.mutans via intracellular tlr2 and nod2 in haecs may be associated with inflammation in cardiovascular disease.
enzymology	flavin is a general name given to molecules having the heteroaromatic ring system of 7,8-dimethylisoalloxazine but practically means riboflavin (rfl), flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad), and flavin mononucleotide (fmn) in biological systems, whose structures are illustrated in fig. 1, together with the atomic numbering scheme and ring numbering of the isoalloxazine moiety. as the isoalloxazine skeleton cannot be synthesized in human cells, it is obtained from diet as rfl (vitamin b-2). fad and fmn can act as cofactors in flavoenzymes but rfl does not. most flavoenzymes catalyze redox reactions of substrates (miura, chem rec 1:183-194, 2001). when o-2 serves as the oxidant in the oxidation half cycle of an enzymic reaction, the enzyme is called ""flavo-oxidase"" but when others do, the enzyme is called ""flavo-dehydrogenase."" the difference between the two types of oxidative catalysis arises from delicate differences in the pi-electron distributions in the isoalloxazine ring, which can be revealed by raman spectroscopy (miura, chem rec 1:183-194, 2001). since a flavin is an extremely versatile molecule, the scientific field including chemistry, biochemistry, and enzymology is collectively called ""flavonology."" it was found recently, however, that the flavin also acts as a chromophore to initiate light-induced dna repair and signal transductions (sancar, chem rev 103:2203-2237, 2003).
southern_blotting	tanhx2, a vacuolar na+-h+ antiport gene from wheat (triticum aestivum l.), was transformed into alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) via agrobacterium-mediated transformation to evaluate the role of vacuolar energy providers in plant salt stress responses. pcr and southern blotting analysis showed that the target gene was integrated into the medicago genome. reverse transcription-pcr indicated that gene tanhx2 was expressed at the transcriptional level. the relative electrical conductivity in the t-2 transgenic plants was lower and the osmotic potential was higher compared to the wild-type plants under salt stress conditions. the tonoplast h+-atpase, h+-pyrophosphatase (ppase) hydrolysis activities and atp-dependent proton pump activities in transgenic plants were all higher than those of wild-type plants, and the enzyme activities could be induced by salt stress. the ppi-dependent proton pump activities decreased when nacl concentrations increased from 100mm to 200mm, especially in transgenic plants. the vacuolar na+-h+ antiport activities of transgenic plants were 2-3 times higher than those of the wild -type plants under 0mm and 100mm nacl stress. na+-h+ antiport activity was not detectable for wild-type plants under 200mm nacl, but for transgenic plants, it was further increased with an increment in salt stress intensity. these results demonstrated that expression of the foreign tanhx2 gene enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic alfalfa.
northern_blotting	hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) acts as a signaling molecule modulating the expression of various genes in plants. however, the reference gene(s) used for gene expression analysis of h2o2 signaling is still arbitrary. a reliable result obtained by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (rt-qpcr) highly depends on accurate transcript normalization using stably expressed reference genes, whereas the inaccurate normalization could easily lead to the false conclusions. in this report, by using genorm and normfinder algorithms, 12 candidate reference genes were evaluated and compared in root and shoot tissues of arabidopsis upon different doses of h2o2. the results revealed that, in our experimental conditions, three novel reference genes (tip41-like, ukn, and ubc21) were identified and validated as suitable reference genes for rt-qpcr normalization in both root and shoot tissues under oxidative stress. this conclusion was further confirmed by publicly available microarray data of methyl viologen and drought stress. in comparison with a single reference gene (ef-1a), the expression pattern of zat12 modulated by h2o2, when using tip41-like, ukn, and ubc21 as multiple reference gene(s), was similar with the previous reports by using northern blotting. thus, we proposed that these three reference genes might be good candidates for other researchers to include in their reference gene validation in gene expression studies under h2o2-related oxidative stress.
northern_blotting	we have reported that orally administrated acetate contributed to suppression of lipogenesis in the liver and to reduction of lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue of otsuka long-evans tokushima fatty (oletf) rats. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acetate on skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. treatment with acetate showed a higher rate of oxygen consumption and a smaller size of lipid droplets in white adipose and brown adipose tissues. an analysis by northern blotting revealed that the transcripts of myoglobin and glut4 genes in the abdominal muscle of the oletf rats were increased by acetate treatment, while the transcripts of lipolytic genes increased in the white adipose and brown adipose tissues. it is possible that acetate has effects on lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscles and the adipose tissues, and has functions that work against obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.
materials_engineering	the mechanical design of biological materials has generated widespread interest in recent years, providing many insights into their intriguing structure property relationships. a critical characteristic of load-bearing materials, which is central to the survival of many species, is their wear and abrasion tolerance. in order to be fully functional, protective armors, dentitious structures and dynamic appendages must be able to tolerate repetitive contact loads without significant loss of materials or internal damage. however, very little is known about this tribological performance. using a contact mechanics framework, we have constructed materials selection charts that provide general predictions about the wear performance of biological materials as a function of their fundamental mechanical properties. one key assumption in constructing these selection charts is that abrasion tolerance is governed by the first irreversible damage at the contact point. the maps were generated using comprehensive data from the literature and encompass a wide range of materials, from heavily mineralized to fully organic materials. our analysis shows that the tolerance of biological materials against abrasion depends on contact geometry, which is ultimately correlated to environmental and selective pressures. comparisons with experimental data from nanoindentation experiments are also drawn in order to verify our predictions. with the increasing amount of data available for biological materials also comes the challenge of selecting relevant model systems for bioinspired materials engineering. we suggest that these maps will be able to guide this selection by providing an overview of biological materials that are predicted to exhibit the best abrasion tolerance, which is of fundamental interest for a wide range of applications, for instance in restorative implants and protective devices.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the relation between viral load and disease severity in childhood acute respiratory tract infections (ari) is not fully understood. objectives: to assess the clinical relevance of the relation between viral load, determined by cycle threshold (ct) value of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and disease severity in children with single-and multiple viral ari. study design: 582 children with ari were prospectively followed and tested for 15 viruses. correlations were calculated between ct values and clinical parameters. results: in single viral ari, statistically significant correlations were found between viral loads of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) and hospitalization and between viral loads of human coronavirus (hcov) and a disease severity score. in multiple-viral ari, statistically significant correlations between viral load and clinical parameters were found. in rsv-rhinovirus (rv) multiple infections, a low viral load of rv was correlated with a high length of hospital stay and a high duration of extra oxygen use. the mean ct value for rv, hcov and parainfluenza virus was significantly lower in single-versus multiple infections. conclusion: although correlations between ct values and clinical parameters in patients with single and multiple viral infection were found, the clinical importance of these findings is limited because individual differences in host-,viral and laboratory factors complicate the interpretation of statistically significant findings. in multiple infections, viral load cannot be used to differentiate between disease causing virus and innocent bystanders.

molecular_biology	trichosanthin (tcs) exhibits an anti-cancer effect on various human cancer cells. however, the mechanism of anti-cancer effect at the molecular level remains to be elucidated. in this study, the underlying anti-cancer mechanism of tcs in human ovarian cancer cells (ovcar-3) was investigated using various molecular biology techniques, such as flow cytometry, western blotting. we major focus on the potential roles of apoptosis and autophagy in tcs inhibition of human ovarian cancer cells. the results demonstrated tcs inhibits human ovarian cancer cells growth due to apoptosis and autophagy. tcs triggers autophagy firstly, which was confirmed by an increased atg5 expression and promoted lc3 cleavage, and subsequent apoptotic cell death. the apoptotic cell death induced by tcs was attenuated by both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy. the autophagy inhibitor 3-ma, which functions at the early stage of autophagy, significantly reduced tcs-induced cell death and caspase-3 activity in human ovarian cancer cells. we also demonstrated that inhibition of apoptosis had no effect on tcs-induced autophagy in ovcar-3 cells. in conclusion, we found that a common pathway between autophagy and apoptosis exists in tcs-induced cell death in human ovarian cancer cells, which might shed light on drug therapy.

internal_combustion_engine	due to marked differences of material properties and combustion characteristics between hydrogen and carbon-based fuels, an increased heat flux inside the cylinder of hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines occurs. the present study aims for a simulation model that describes the wall heat transfer within the entire range of engine calibration possibilities. conducted experiments on a hydrogen engine equipped with temperature sensors provide the base for the present study. using the surface temperature method, highly resolved instantaneous surface heat fluxes can be identified. these measurements are compared with results from published heat transfer models that are originally developed for conventional fuels. as no satisfying result with these models can be obtained for the hydrogen engine, a modified heat transfer model is derived and validated based on the experimental data. necessary developments on characteristic model features lead to a distinctive model for a hydrogen engine. it is demonstrated that the proposed model attains a consistently high prediction quality for a broad range of engine calibration variabilities.

genetics	lambda interferon (ifn-lambda) has potent antiviral effects against multiple enteric viral pathogens, including norovirus and rotavirus, in both preventing and curing infection. because the intestine includes a diverse array of cell types, however, the cell(s) upon which ifn-lambda acts to exert its antiviral effects is unclear. here, we sought to identify ifn-lambda-responsive cells by generation of mice with lineage-specific deletion of the receptor for ifn-lambda, ifnlr1. we found that expression of ifnlr1 on intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) in the small intestine and colon is required for enteric ifn-lambda antiviral activity. iec ifnlr1 expression also determines the efficacy of ifn-lambda in resolving persistent murine norovirus (mnov) infection and regulates fecal shedding and viral titers in tissue. thus, the expression of ifnlr1 by iecs is necessary for the response to both endogenous and exogenous ifn-lambda. we further demonstrate that iec ifnlr1 expression is required for the sterilizing innate immune effects of ifn-lambda by extending these findings in rag1-deficient mice. finally, we assessed whether our findings pertained to multiple viral pathogens by infecting mice specifically lacking iec ifnlr1 expression with reovirus. these mice phenocopied ifnlr1-null animals, exhibiting increased intestinal tissue titers and enhanced reovirus fecal shedding. thus, iecs are the critical cell type responding to ifn-lambda to control multiple enteric viruses. this is the first genetic evidence that supports an essential role for iecs in ifn-lambda-mediated control of enteric viral infection, and these findings provide insight into the mechanism of ifn-lambda-mediated antiviral activity. importance human noroviruses (hnovs) are the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. type iii interferons (ifn-lambda) control enteric viral infections in the gut and have been shown to cure mouse norovirus, a small-animal model for hnovs. using a genetic approach with conditional knockout mice, we identified iecs as the dominant ifn-lambda-responsive cells in control of enteric virus infection in vivo. upon murine norovirus or reovirus infection, ifnlr1 depletion in iecs largely recapitulated the phenotype seen in ifnlr1(-/-) mice of higher intestinal tissue viral titers and increased viral shedding in the stool. moreover, ifn-lambda-mediated sterilizing immunity against murine norovirus requires the capacity of iecs to respond to ifn-lambda. these findings clarify the mechanism of action of this cytokine and emphasize the therapeutic potential of ifn-lambda for treating mucosal viral infections.
immunology	the purposes of this study were to determine: (i) the extent of an acute session of high-intensity intermittent exercise (hiie) followed by a concurrent strength session (conc) on the increase of systemic inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and (ii) whether eight weeks of high intensity interval training plus concurrent strength training alters the acute inflammatory response and immune status. ten recreationally active males (aged 26.9 +/- 4.3 years) performed two experimental exercise sessions interspersed by eight weeks of hilt plus concurrent strength training. the experimental exercise session was composed of a 5-km run on a treadmill (1:1 at 100% of maximal aerobic speed (mas)), and after 10 min of passive recovery, back squat exercises were performed (80% 1rm, four sets until exhaustion). serum samples were collected after fasting, pre-hiie, post-hiie, pre-conc, post-conc, and 30 and 60 min postexercise session. the comparison between both concurrent exercise sessions was performed using repeated measure anova, with the bonferroni post-hoc when necessary. interleukin-6 (il-6) presented a moment effect (f = 6.72; p < 0.05), with post-conc significantly higher than pre-hiie, post-hiie, and 60 min, only a tendency was found between pre-hiie and post-hiie (difference =-5.99; p = 0.09). mcp-1 and il-ira did not present effects for condition, moment, or interaction. interleuldn-10 (il-10) presented both moment and interaction effects (f = 5.31 and 2.50; p = 0.005 and 0.036). pre-conc and post-conc were significantly higher than pre-hiie. the interaction between before and after eight weeks of concurrent training probably occurred at post-conc (11.42 +/- 3.09 pg ml(-1) and 8.88 +/- 1.29 pg ml(-1)). in addition, maintenance of immune function was observed. therefore, hiie and concurrent strength exercise lead to an increase in cytokines response, but eight weeks of training program promoted antiinflammatory response after an acute session of concurrent exercise.

southern_blotting	nine italian peach nurseries, which use agrobacterium rhizogenes strain k84 to protect plants from crown gall, were monitored for three years with the aim of determining whether transconjugant populations may arise following plasmid exchanges between k84 and autochtonous soil agrobacteria. six hundred and seventy-eight agrobacterium isolates were obtained from 120 tumours developed on apricot and peach rootstocks that had been treated in pre-planting with the antagonist. agrobacteria were characterized for pathogenicity, biovar, opine catabolism and agrocin 84 sensitivity. colony hybridization was used for screening the isolates harbouring plasmids pti and/or pagk84. analysis of plasmid content and southern blotting were performed on putative transconjugant agrobacteria found in tumours collected from one nursery where a biological control breakdown was observed. the rflp analysis of 16s + igs regions showed that pagk84 was transferred from the antagonist to virulent and avirulent soil agrobacteria belonging to different ribotypes. pathogenic transconjugants, inoculated on gf677 rootstocks, were not controlled in vivo by k84 and stably maintained pti and pagk84 in the bacterial cells for at least one year. at the end of a biocontrol trial, new transconjugant tumorigenic agrobacteria originated by the transfer of pagk84 to the pathogen. virulent and avirulent transconjugants may represent a real threat for biological control by k84 strain since all of them produced agrocin and were insensitive to it. survival in soil of these populations could make the future application of k84 ineffective.
genetics	the pyrenean desman (galemys pyrenaicus) is a small, semiaquatic mammal endemic to the pyrenean mountains and the northern half of the iberian peninsula where it lives in cold and well-oxygenated flowing mountain streams. this species is currently classified as vulnerable on the iucn red list and has been undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation for decades, inevitably impacting its distribution. a recent genetic study, based on mitochondrial and intronic sequences, showed that the genetic variability of the pyrenean desman is very low in the pyrenees. in this study, we investigated the potential existence of genetic structure and gene flow at a smaller scale using 24 polymorphic microsatellite loci. as the pyrenean desman is a very elusive species, we supplemented our tissue sample collection with samples of feces collected in the french range of this species. we successfully identified 70 individuals based on 355 fecal samples. bayesian analyses revealed 3 genetic and geographic clusters (1 eastern, 1 central, and 1 western, including 3 genetic subclusters), with origins tracing back only 200 years. these clusters were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity and high inbreeding coefficients. although gene flow among clusters appeared to be limited, populations seem to have exchanged alleles recently. therefore, connectivity between watersheds should be enhanced to maintain genetic diversity and potentially improve the long-term survival of the pyrenean desman in france.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective several studies have reported that retinoic acid (ra) might be used to treat malignancies. the effects of ra are mediated by the ra receptor (rar), and rar/rar especially acts as a tumor suppressor. however, little is known about its role in human endometrial cancer. materials and methods in this study, we examined the effects of all-trans ra (atra) on progression of human endometrial cancer cell line, rl95-2 and hec1a. we then examined the expression of rar and rar in 50 endometrial cancer tissues by using immunohistochemistry. results we found inhibitory effects of atra on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration in rl95-2 cells, but not in hec1a cells. rar or rar knockdown individually could not cancel out the inhibition of cell proliferation by atra in rl95-2 cells, but simultaneous knockdown of rar and rar could block its effect on proliferation. rar and rar knockdown dose dependently reduced the inhibition of migration by atra, but the effect was more pronounced with rar knockdown than with rar knockdown. we confirmed that rar gene was directly regulated by atra in microarray and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. furthermore, the rar agonist (bms453) significantly suppressed proliferation of rl95-2 cells. in immunohistochemical analysis, rar expression was positively correlated with tumor grade, and rar showed the opposite tendency in endometrial cancer. conclusions retinoic acid might have multiple antitumor effects, and rar may be a potent therapeutic target in ra treatment for endometrial cancers.
fluid_mechanics	objectives/hypothesisthis study aimed to investigate and measure airway dynamics in anatomical regions where laryngeal cancer was most common in comparison to other regions of the larynx, thereby determining the effect of airway dynamics on the development of laryngeal cancer. study design and methodspulmonary function test airflow data and larynx anatomy measurement data obtained by three-dimensional computed tomography. a healthy male adult was modeled by simulation using the ansys program. analysis of air flow rates, pressure, and force were also made. resultsthe supraglottic region average pressure was higher when compared to the subglottic region and clearly lower when compared to the glottic region. the subglottic had the lowest pressure and force levels. the glottic region was the first ranked location for laryngeal cancer; the supraglottic region was the second; and the frequency of laryngeal cancer was much lower in the subglottic region. our data suggests that the high pressure and force contribute to an increased amount of contact and interaction between toxic particles and mucosa and to increased diffusion of the particles, leading to an increased carcinogenic effect and frequency of cancer. conclusionlaryngeal cancer was found more frequently in regions with an increased pressure and force stress and reduced air velocity, with a subsequent increase in penetration of the inhaled toxic agents. these findings demonstrate the importance of basic physical fluid mechanics in cancer pathogenesis. level of evidencena. laryngoscope, 126:1136-1142, 2016
manufacturing_engineering	tolerances play an important role in modem manufacturing engineering and impact significantly the quality of a product and machining cost. in conventional methods, tolerances design is divided into two separate sequential stages i.e. product tolerance design and process tolerance design. this sequential tolerances design method would result in some problems in cooperation, continuity, and consistency between two separate design stages. a more rational approach in tolerance design is concurrent tolerancing which consolidate the two sequential design stages into one. in this paper, a genetic algorithm (ga) is used for concurrent tolerance design based on manufacturing cost and quality loss. a practical example is used to illustrate the design process. the calculation results by using ca are compared with those by conventional nonlinear optimization method.
internal_combustion_engine	the performance, efficiency and emissions of internal combustion (ic) engines are affected by the thermo-viscous boundary layer region and heat transfer. computational models for the prediction of engine performance typically rely on equilibrium wall-function models to overcome the need for resolving the viscous boundary layer structure. the wall shear stress and heat flux are obtained as boundary conditions for the outer flow calculation. however, these equilibrium wall-function models are typically derived by considering canonical flow configurations, introducing substantial modeling assumptions that are not necessarily justified for in-cylinder flows. the objective of this work is to assess the validity of several model approximations that are commonly introduced in the development of wall-function models for ic-engine applications. this examination is performed by considering crank-angle resolved high-resolution micro-particle image velocimetry (a mu-piv) measurements in a spark-ignition direct-injection single cylinder engine. using these measurements, the performance of an algebraic equilibrium wall-function model commonly used in rans and les ic-engine simulations is evaluated. by identifying shortcomings of this model, a non-equilibrium differential wall model is developed and two different closures are considered for the determination of the turbulent viscosity. it is shown that both wall models provide adequate predictions if applied inside the viscous sublayer. however, the equilibrium wall-function model consistently underpredicts the shear stress if applied in the log-layer. in contrast, the non-equilibrium wall model provides improved predictions of the near-wall region and shear stress irrespective of the wall distance and the piston location. by utilizing the experimental data, significant adverse pressure gradients due to the large vortical motion inside the cylinder (induced by tumble, swirl and turbulence) are observed and included in the non-equilibrium wall model to further improve the model performance. these investigations are complemented by developing a consistent wall heat transfer model, and simulation results are compared against the equilibrium wall-function model and woschni 's empirical correlation.
enzymology	the positive effect of lipoxygenase, added as an enzyme-active soy flour, during the production of white bread is well established. in addition to increasing the mixing tolerance and overall dough rheology, lipoxygenase is also an effective bleaching agent. it is known that these effects are mediated by enzyme-coupled cooxidation of gluten proteins and carotenoids. however, the mechanism whereby these effects are achieved is not yet fully understood. in order to gain a better understanding into the reactions governing the beneficial effects of lipoxygenases in bread dough, an in-depth knowledge of the lipoxygenase catalytic mechanism is required. until now no single review combining the molecular enzymology of lipoxygenase enzymes and their application in the baking industry has been presented. this review, therefore, focuses on the extraction and molecular characterization of lipoxygenases in addition to the work done on the application of lipoxygenases in the baking industry.
hydraulics	sediment transport is an important aspect of soil erosion, and sediment transport capacity (t-c) is a key to establishing process -based erosion models. a lot of studies exist that have determined t-c for overland flow, however, few studies have been conducted to determine t-c for loess sediments on steep slopes. experimental data for this region are thus needed. the objectives of this study are to formulate new equations to describe t-c and evaluate the suitability of these equations for loess sediments on steep slopes. the slope gradients in this study ranged from 10.51% to 38.39%, and flow discharges per unit width varied from 1.11 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) to 3.78 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1). results showed that 11 increased as a power function with flow discharge and slope gradient, with r-2 = 0.99 and nash -sut(c)liffe model efficiency (nse) = 0.99. t, was more sensitive to flow discharge than slope gradient. t-c increased as a power function with mean flow velocity, which was satisfied to predict t-c with r-2 = 0.99 and nse = 0.99. shear stress (r2 = 0.89, nse = 0.88) was also a good predictor of t-c, and stream power (r-2 = 0.96, nse = 0.96) was a better predictor of t-c than shear stress. however, unit stream power was not a good predictor to estimate t-c in our study, with r-2 = 0.63 and nse = 0.62. these findings offer a new approach for predicting t-c for loess sediments on steep slopes. 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
manufacturing_engineering	there are many ways to achieve knowledge. the experience presented in this paper is one that describes the knowledge achievement process thru knowledge models - in this case using concept maps. the subject of the experiment was to design a knowledge model on a technical subject: turning. the project participants were the students of the terminal year from the engineering faculty of sibiu, lucian blaga university. especially the technical field is one in which knowledge (information interpreted with a result) are hard to reach because of the important quantity of information which in the absence of the right connections made between them they remain raw dates, difficult to understand, hard to integrate in a real technical context in order to solve a given problem.
molecular_biology	to observe the biological characteristic and the prognoses in patients with acute erythroleukemia (ael). the results of 167 patients with newly diagnosed ael, from january 2004 and june 2014 in the department of hematology, shandong province chinese medicine hospital, were reviewed by morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, molecular biology. flow cytometry analysis indicated that cd13 (96.1 %), cd33 (95.1 %), cd117 (87.4 %) and cd34 (79.4 %) were highly expressed in ael. 56 of 148 (37.8 %) ael patients had a variety of cytogenetic abnormalities, 27 of 148 (18.2 %) patients were complex karyotype (abnormal involving 3 or more chromosomes), the abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more frequently involved and the most common one was +8, accounting for 35.7 % of all abnormal karyotype, followed by 5q- (17.9 %). mutation analysis showed cebpa mutation ratio of ael patients was 44.0 % (11/25), that of npm1as 15.4 % (4/26). initial induced remission rate of ael was 56.6 % (30/53), compared by 33.3 % (4/12) of mdsm6. survival analysis was shown that the overall survival in female was better than that in male (p = 0.047). the overall survival time of transplantation group was significantly longer than chemotherapy group (p = 0.000). the os of 13-39 years old group was the best, 40-49 years old group took second place, >50 years old group appeared to be the worst. patients with aml-m-6 had dysplasia in varying degrees in granulocyte, erythrocyte and megakaryocyte series. periodic acid-shiff reaction staining in polychromatic erythroblast and ortho-chromatic erythroblast had a specificity in the diagnosis of ael. ael had its own unique biological features, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could significantly improve its poor prognosis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	chimerism associated with placental sharing in marmosets has been traditionally analysed using conventional chromosome staining on metaphase spreads or polymerase chain reaction. however, the former technique requires the presence of proliferating cells, whereas the latter may be associated with possible blood cell contamination. therefore, we aimed to develop a single-cell analysis technique for sexing marmoset cells. we applied fluorescent in situ hybridisation (fish) to cell nuclei using differentially labelled x and y chromosome-specific probes. herein we present the validation of this method in metaphase cells from a marmoset lymphoblastoid cell line, as well as application of the method for evaluation of cross-sex chimerism in interphase blood lymphocytes and haematopoietic bone marrow cells from marmosets of same- and mixed-sex litters. the results show conclusively that haematopoietic cells of bone marrow and leucocytes from blood are cross-sex chimeric when the litter is mixed sex. in addition, single samples of liver and spleen cell suspensions from one individual were tested. cross-sex chimerism was observed in the spleen but not in liver cells. we conclude that fish is the method of choice to identify cross-sex chimerism, especially when combined with morphological identification of nuclei of different cell types, which will allow a targeted tissue-specific analysis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	introductiondetection of recurrent genetic abnormalities is of great significance for a refined diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in leukemia. conventional nested reverse transcription pcr is labor intensive and time-consuming. methodswe have developed a novel dual-color taqman probe-based real-time pcr method for the simultaneous screening of 45 fusion transcripts in 12 parallel reactions. the method was tested and validated with cell lines carrying known fusion transcripts and patient samples. resultsa multiplex real-time pcr method was successfully developed for rapid detection of 45 fusion genes and validated for 15 of the more commonly detected fusion genes. intra-assay reproducibility assessed for the most frequent rearrangements ranged from 0.41% to 0.74% for the coefficient of variation (cv) of cycle threshold (ct) and the interassay reproducibility ranged from 1.62% to 2.83% in five separate experiments. the lowest detection limit for the translocations tested ranged between 1 : 16 000 and 1 : 32 000. validation of the method with 213 patient samples showed 100% specificity and excellent consistence with conventional nested rt-pcr. conclusionoverall, we believe that this method is easily applicable, cost-effective, and clinically useful for a rapid screening of fusion genes in the initial diagnostic phase of leukemia. its use can also be extended to the monitoring of minimal residual disease.
hydraulics	tree-rings are precious natural archives to assess ecosystem variability over time. xylem anatomy in woody tissue is a promising source of information in tree-rings since it is closely linked to tree hydraulics and carbon fixation. however, despite the rising interest for cell anatomy in dendrochronology, still little is known about the interpretation of the variability of cell anatomical responses observed across different environments and species. here we analyze cell anatomical responses to increasing summer drought on 18 trees from 3 conifer species (picea obovata, pinus sylvestris, and larix sibirica) growing in the transition zone between forest and steppe in the republic of khakassia (russia). analyses include the comparison of tracheid size distributions along climatic gradients and contrasting micro-topography from 1986 to 2008. results indicate an overall decrease of earlywood tracheid lumen and cell wall thickness to high temperature and drought regardless of species and site conditions. in particular an increase of one degree celsius during the summer caused up to 5% reduction of earlywood cell lumen and wall thickness. these anatomical shifts suggest that a downscaling of hydraulic efficiency is not paralleled by increased hydraulic safety, presumably due to carbon limitation. based on the results of this case study, we suggest that increasing drought stress might hamper the formation of a functional xylem structure, thus being a possible trigger for a miss-acclimation causing long-term decline and higher exposure to hydraulic failures. despite the promising study approach, more studies including more data (trees, years) and broader climatic gradients would be needed to further improve our mechanistic understanding.

cell_biology	the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (igf) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of islet cell biology. however, the signaling pathway(s) utilized by insulin to directly modulate -cells is unclear. to interrogate whether insulin exerts endocrine effects in regulating proteins in the insulin/igf-1 signaling cascade in vivo in physiological states via the insulin receptor, we designed two experimental approaches: 1) glucose gavage and 2) hyperinsulinemic intravenous infusion, for studies in either -cell specific insulin receptor knock-out (irko) or control mice. immunostaining of sections of pancreas (collected immediately after glucose gavage or insulin infusion) from controls showed significant increases in pakt+, p-p70s6k+, and perk+ -cells and a significant decrease in % nuclear foxo1+ -cells compared with corresponding vehicle-treated groups. in contrast, in irkos, we observed no significant changes in pakt+ or p-p70s6k+ -cells in either experiment; however, perk+ -cells were significantly increased, and an attenuated decrease in % nuclear foxo1+ cells was evident in response to glucose gavage or insulin infusion. treatment of control and irko -cell lines with glucose or insulin showed significantly decreased % nuclear foxo1+ -cells suggesting direct effects. furthermore, blocking mapk signaling had virtually no effect on foxo1 nuclear export in controls, in contrast to attenuated export in irko -cells. these data suggest insulin acts on -cells in an endocrine manner in the normal situation; and that in -cells lacking insulin receptors, insulin and glucose minimally activate the akt pathway, while erk phosphorylation and foxo1 nuclear export occur independently of insulin signaling.
genetics	the leon springs pupfish (cyprinodon bovinus) is an endangered species currently restricted to a single desert spring and a separate captive habitat in southwestern north america. following establishment of the captive population from wild stock in 1976, the wild population has undergone natural population size fluctuations, intentional culling to purge genetic contamination from an invasive congener (cyprinodon variegatus) and augmentation/replacement of wild fish from the captive stock. a severe population decline following the most recent introduction of captive fish prompted us to examine whether the captive and wild populations have differentiated during the short time they have been isolated from one another. if so, the development of divergent genetic and/or morphologic traits between populations could contribute to a diminished ability of fish from one location to thrive in the other. examination of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and morphologic variation revealed no evidence of residual c. variegatus characteristics in contemporary c. bovinus samples. however, significant genetic and morphologic differentiation was detected between the wild and captive populations, some of which might reflect local adaptation. our results indicate that genetic and physical characteristics can diverge rapidly between isolated subdivisions of managed populations, potentially compromising the value of captive stock for future supplementation efforts. in the case of c. bovinus, our findings underscore the need to periodically inoculate the captive population with wild genetic material to help mitigate genetic, and potentially morphologic, divergence between them and also highlight the utility of parallel morphologic and genomic evaluation to inform conservation management planning.
hydraulics	this study aims to understand (mainly qualitatively) the long-term role of human impact on avulsion processes and the development of fluvial (mega-) fans in semi-arid environments. in this paper we refer to human impact as the direct influences of actions on the river 's hydraulics (i.e. flow regulation, flow diversion and channel engineering). in five case-studies drawn from the khuzestan plains in southwest iran we have analysed the setup and triggering conditions of specific avulsions that occurred in the past (timescale of millennia) and identified the role of human interference in their causation. our analysis is based on the integration of historical, archaeological, geomorphological and geological data. through this study we demonstrate that avulsions in the khuzestan plains are the result of long-term and complex interplay between multiple human-induced and natural causes. in similar ways human-induced actions may play important roles during different phases of avulsion development. the success of an avulsion in the post-triggering phase may be defined by human-induced setup causes as well as morphodynamic processes. we suggest that present-day flood events may be partly inherited from long-term human alterations of the natural processes. these finding could have implications for any fluvial system (e.g. distributive fluvial systems, deltas) where avulsion plays a major role in their development and research tends to emphasize on natural mechanisms. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
polymerase_chain_reaction	oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most aggressive cancer that is associated with high recurrence, metastasis, and poor treatment outcome. dysregulation of long non-coding rnas has been shown to promote tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers. in this study, we investigated the expression of 11 selected long non-coding rnas that are associated with cell proliferation, metastasis, and tumor suppression in oral squamous cell carcinomas and normal tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. out of the 11 long non-coding rnas profiled, 9 were significantly overexpressed in tumors with tobacco chewing history. moreover, the long non-coding rna profile was similar to the head and neck cancer datasets of the cancer genome atlas database. linc-ror, a regulator of reprogramming, implicated in tumorigenesis was found to be overexpressed in undifferentiated tumors and showed strong association with tumor recurrence and poor therapeutic response. in oral squamous cell carcinomas, for the first time, we observed linc-ror overexpression, downregulation of mir-145-5p, and overexpression of c-myc, klf4, oct4, and sox2, suggesting the existence of linc-ror-mediated competing endogenous rna network in undifferentiated tumors. taken together, this study demonstrated the association of linc-ror overexpression in undifferentiated oral tumors and its prognostic value to predict the therapeutic response.
machine_design	the flow of muck and cuttings in the face, cutterhead, cutting chamber, and screw conveyor determines the pressure profile of the excavated soil as well as its impact on the wear of the related components in a soft ground tunneling machine. this paper discusses the use of computational fluid dynamic (cfd) to simulate the flow characteristic of the conditioned soil in the screw conveyor of earth pressure balance (epb) tunnel boring machine. in this simulation, conditioned soil assumed to behavior as a bingham plastic fluid. back analysis method in conjunction with cfd modeling is used to calculate the rheological properties of soil from a set of known screw conveyor torque read outs from a machine operating in seattle, wa. the error of the torque values between the simulation results and actual field data is in the range of 0.1-6.2%. this illustrate that the cfd method can simulate the soil movement in the screw conveyor of epb machines. the results also indicates that the same approach can be used to optimize the machine design to minimize torque and wear as well as optimizing machine operating parameters during the tunneling operation to improve productivity and have a better control of the face pressure.

thermodynamics	coco peat powder (cpd), the main by-product of the coconut palm, is an excellent source of environmentally friendly magnetic sorbent with potential application in oil-spill cleanup. in order to develop the best resource for the agricultural crop and alleviate environmental stress caused by disposal of natural cpd, fe3o4 nanoparticles were immobilized on coco peat powder (cpd) with the aid of mussel-inspired polydopamine (pda) and then chemically modified by low-surface-energy octadecylamine (oda) to fabricate a novel magnetic coco peat powder (mcpd) for selective oil-water separation. the obtained mcpi), which had high hydrophobicity (water contact angle: 135 +/- 3 degrees) and saturation magnetization of 27.6 emu/g, exhibited remarkable sorption efficiency for convenient removal of oils from water and displayed excellent separating performance under an auxiliary magnetic field. the results indicated that the highest amount of oil sorption on mcpd reached 8.57 times of its own weight, and the oil could be desorbed from the oil-loaded mcpd and easily recycled for at least 11 cycles. the oil-loaded mcpd also exhibited high recyclability, with a loss of less than 15.32% in oil-sorption capacity after 11 cycles, which suggests that the mcpd prepared through the proposed synthesis process has high potential for application in large-scale removal of spilled oils from water. this work also provides a universal strategy for developing an oil-pollution treatment using natural resources from the waste stream.

genetics	adna studies are a cooperative field of research with a broad range of applications including evolutionary biology, genetics, anthropology and archaeology. scientists are using ancient molecules as source material for historical questions. colleagues from the humanities are observing this with both interest and concern because adna research is affecting academic identities and both concepts of history and historiography. adna research developed in a way that can be described as a hype cycle (chackie fenn). technological triggers such as sanger sequencing and the polymerase chain reaction kicked off a multitude of experiments with ancient dna during the 1980s and 1990s. geneticists, microbiologists, anthropologists and many more euphorically joined a ""molecule hunt"". adna was promoted as a time machine. media attention was enormous. as experiments and implementations began to fail and contamination was discovered to be a tremendous problem, media interest waned and many labs lost their interest. some turned their disillusionment into systematic research into methodology and painstakingly established lab routines. the authenticity problem was first addressed by control oriented measures but later approached from a more cognitive theoretical perspective as the pitfalls and limits of adna became clearer. by the end of the 2000s the field reached its current plateau of productivity. cross-disciplinary debates, conflicts and collaborations are increasing critical reflection among all participants. historians should consider joining the field in a kind of critical friendship to both make the most of its possibilities and give an input from a constructivist perspective.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper seeks to examine the characteristics and importance of the heat transfer phenomena in combustion chamber walls. in-cylinder pressure and combustion chamber wall temperature (tw) were measured under motored and fired conditions in a spark-ignition (si) engine. parameters were measured at a constant engine speed (1,500rpm), at different ignition timings, and same phi=1.0, separately for lpg, gasoline, or hydrogen. cooling loss and heat release were investigated with different heat transfer equations for all three fuels. also, the cooling loss of hydrogen was compared with fossil fuels to investigate the differences in heat transfer. the values for a correction constant required for each fuel were determined using different heat transfer equations. the findings of this study suggest that the proposed model has better prediction results than eichelberg 's heat transfer coefficient equation and burnt 's specific heat ratio equation for all ignition timings and fuels.
immunology	nk cell cytotoxicity in chediak-higashi syndrome (chs) is strongly impaired as lytic granules are not released upon nk-target cell contact, contributing to several defects typical of this severe immunodeficiency. correction of ni(cell defects in chs should improve the outcome of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, proposed as therapy. we investigated nk cell functions in a chs patient before and after cord-blood transplantation, and the ability of in vitro il-2 treatment to restore them. before the transplant, the strong defect in nk cell-mediated natural and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, as well as in ifn-gamma production, could be restored up to normal levels by in vitro il-2 treatment. this cytokine also caused the appearance of smaller lysosomal granules and their orientation towards the nk-target cell contact area, thus suggesting that il-2 had a more general capacity to restore nk cell effector functions. moreover after the transplant, although the successful engraftment, nk cell cytotoxicity resulted still partially impaired at one year, almost normal at ten years and, anyhow, fully recovered by in vitro il-2 treatment. taken together, our results indicate that il-2 had a wide capacity to restore nk cell effector functions, being able to reverse the altered cytotoxic activity, lytic granule pattern, and cytokine production observed in the chs patient.

machine_design	particle swarm optimization (pso) and genetic algorithms (ga) are used to minimize the cost of a permanent magnet (pm) synchronous generator with concentrated windings for tidal power applications. with the use of matlabs global optimization toolbox, it is possible to run several optimization algorithms on the same problem, and to combine the two stochastic solvers ga and pso with the gradient based solver fmincon to produce two hybrid optimization solvers. it has been shown that a complex machine design problem with tight constraints and a narrow solution space is difficult to solve for both a ga and for pso. both ga and pso were unable to find the optimal value on their own. hybrid versions of ga and pso gave better results. the average minimum costs found with hybrid pso and hybrid ga were 1.07 and 1.11 times the global minimum. when the integer value was set to the optimal value, the hybrid ga found a mean cost only 1.01 times the global minimum. for both algorithms, it was necessary to increase the population size to improve the fitness functions and reduce the variance.
molecular_biology	here, we report a method for time-resolved, longitudinal extraction and quantitative measurement of intracellular proteins and mrna from a variety of cell types. cytosolic contents were repeatedly sampled from the same cell or population of cells for more than 5 d through a cell-culture substrate, incorporating hollow 150-nm-diameter nanostraws (ns) within a defined sampling region. once extracted, the cellular contents were analyzed with conventional methods, including fluorescence, enzymatic assays (elisa), and quantitative real-time pcr. this process was nondestructive with >95% cell viability after sampling, enabling long-term analysis. it is important to note that the measured quantities from the cell extract were found to constitute a statistically significant representation of the actual contents within the cells. of 48 mrna sequences analyzed from a population of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stemcells (hipsc-cms), 41 were accurately quantified. the ns platform samples from a select subpopulation of cells within a larger culture, allowing native cell-to-cell contact and communication even during vigorous activity such as cardiomyocyte beating. this platform was applied both to cell lines and to primary cells, including cho cells, hipsc-cms, and human astrocytes derived in 3d cortical spheroids. by tracking the same cell or group of cells over time, this method offers an avenue to understand dynamic cell behavior, including processes such as induced pluripotency and differentiation.
immunology	among athletes and coaches, there is a common perception that high training loads and competitions, applied chronically, with inadequate nutritional control and/or recovery periods, may reduce the immune resistance, increasing susceptibility to infection episodes, mainly upper respiratory tract infection (urti). in this sense, this study is focused on reviewing the interactions between immunological parameters with the overtraining syndrome, specifically in team sports, considering its intermittent nature. thus, a review of national and international journals related to the topic was held. the correlations between exercise, immune system and susceptibility to urti have been evaluated mainly in individual and endurance sports compared to the team sports. the modulations of leukocytes throughout the season, against the totalization of training loads and competitions, when analyzed specifically for neutrophils and monocytes, are possibly related to tissue repair processes and incidence of urti. modulations related to lymphocytes seem to be more directly related to the incidence of urti. moreover, an understanding of all the proposed markers, including immunological markers, in association with the performance indicators and control of training, appears to be a more promising avenue for clinical diagnosis of the athlete 's immune status and prevention of overtraining syndrome than the search for a unique marker of overtraining.
cell_biology	we review the bio-activities of natural product sesquiterpenes and present the first description of their effects upon mitosis. this type of biological effect upon cells is unexpected because sesquiterpenes are believed to inactivate proteins through michael-type additions that cause non-specific cytotoxicity. yet, certain types of sesquiterpenes can arrest cells in mitosis as measured by cell biology, biochemical and imaging techniques. we have listed the sesquiterpenes that arrest cells in mitosis and analyzed the biological data that support those observations. in view of the biochemical complexity of mitosis, we propose that a subset of sesquiterpenes have a unique chemical structure that can target a precise protein(s) required for mitosis. since the process of mitotic arrest precedes that of cell death, it is possible that some sesquiterpenes that are currently classified as cytotoxic might also induce a mitotic arrest. our analysis provides a new perspective of sesquiterpene chemical biology.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aimsthymomas and thymic squamous cell carcinomas (tsqccs) are rare thymic epithelial tumours. data on angiogenesis and vascular phenotype in these tumours are limited, and no study has taken histological world health organization (who) subtypes into account. the aim of this study was to compare vascularization, pericytes coverage and expression of angiogenic growth factors in different who-defined subtypes of thymoma methods and resultsvascular density, diameter and architecture and expression of -smooth muscle actin (sma), platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) receptor- (pdgfr), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) receptor 1 (vegfr1) and vegf receptor 2 (vegfr2) were investigated in who type a, ab, b1, b2 and b3 thymomas and tsqccs, by the use of immunostaining, quantitative morphometry, and tumour vessel isolation by trypsin digestion. expression levels of angiopoietin 1 (ang-1), angiopoietin 2 (ang-2), vegf-a, pdgf-b and hif-1 were examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. a and ab thymomas were characterized by a dense network of capillary-like vessels with tight pericyte coverage, whereas b thymomas showed a loose vascular network with increasing vascular diameters and increasing expression of sma and pdgfr from b1 to b3 thymomas and tsqccs. vegfr1 and vegfr2 were expressed in vessels of all analysed tumour entities, and at higher levels in epithelial cells of a and b3 thymomas and tsqccs. mrna of ang-2, but not of ang-1, was significantly up-regulated in all thymoma subtypes, with the highest levels being found in a thymomas. in tsqccs, ang-1 and vegf were the predominantly up-regulated growth factors. hif-1 was only up-regulated in b3 thymomas and tsqccs. conclusionthymomas and tsqccs differ significantly in their vascular architecture and expression of key angiogenic growth factors. the findings could help to improve the differential diagnosis of difficult-to-classify thymic epithelial tumours, and indicate different mechanisms of tumour angiogenesis and functional differences of tumour vessels of major thymoma subtypes and tsqccs.
immunology	rationale: forkhead box p3(+) t regulatory cells (tregs) are key players in maintaining immune homeostasis. evidence suggests that tregs respond to environmental cues to permit or suppress inflammation. in atherosclerosis, th1-driven inflammation affects treg homeostasis, but the mechanisms governing this phenomenon are unclear. objective: here, we address whether atherosclerosis impacts treg plasticity and functionality in apoe(-/-) mice, and what effect treg plasticity might have on the pathology of atherosclerosis. methods and results: we demonstrate that atherosclerosis promotes treg plasticity, resulting in the reduction of cxcr3(+) tregs and the accumulation of an intermediate th1-like interferon (ifn)-gamma(+) ccr5(+) treg subset (th1/tregs) within the aorta. importantly, th1/tregs arise in atherosclerosis from bona fide tregs, rather than from t-effector cells. we show that th1/tregs recovered from atherosclerotic mice are dysfunctional in suppression assays. using an adoptive transfer system and plasticity-prone mir146a-/-tregs, we demonstrate that elevated ifn gamma(+)mir146a(-/-)th1/tregs are unable to adequately reduce atherosclerosis, arterial th1, or macrophage content within apoe(-/-) mice, in comparison to mir146a(+/+) tregs. finally, via single-cell rna-sequencing and real-time-polymerase chain reaction, we show that th1/tregs possess a unique transcriptional phenotype characterized by coexpression of treg and th1 lineage genes and a downregulation of treg-related genes, including ikzf2, ikzf4, tigit, lilrb4, and il10. in addition, an ingenuity pathway analysis further implicates ifn gamma, ifn alpha, interleukin-2, interleukin-7, ctla-4 (cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4), t-cell receptor, and csnk2b-related pathways in regulating treg plasticity. conclusions: atherosclerosis drives treg plasticity, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional ifn gamma(+) th1/tregs that may permit further arterial inflammation and atherogenesis.
computer-aided_design	exploratory research was performed on a promising safety intervention concept, prevention through design (ptd), also known as designing for construction safety (dfcs). the overall research goal was to increase understanding of the role that owners of constructed facilities can play in adopting ptd on their capital projects. a total of 65 face-to-face interviews and 79 anonymous surveys were completed at four case-study organizations in addition to 103 surveys completed online by members of national construction associations and organizations. industry survey data indicate that while the majority of owner firm employees had not heard of ptd, they find the concept compelling and do not anticipate significant barriers to its implementation. key empirical findings indicate that (1) an explicit ptd process is required for implementation; (2) proactive owner leadership and involvement are necessary to initiate ptd on a project; (3) owner leadership is required both to set high expectations for worker safety and health and to ensure general contractor and trade contractor personnel participation in the design review process; and (4) supporting tools, such as design checklists, four dimensional (4d) computer-aided design (cad) systems, and risk identification and assessment documents, facilitate the ptd process. these findings can be used by owners to most effectively implement a ptd program on one or more of their projects.

human_metabolism	the cytochrome enzyme p4503a4 (cyp3a4) is thought to play a major part in the human metabolism of clozapine. nefazodone is a potent and specific in-vivo inhibitor of cyp3a4. we co-administered nefazodone and clozapine in six patients and found that mean clozapine levels rose by 4% of baseline and norclozapine levels by 16%. based on these observations, it is inferred that inhibition of cyp3a4 in vivo has minimal effects on clozapine metabolism. nefazodone appears to be safe when co-administered,vith clozapine. int clin psychopharmacol 14-185-187 (c) 1999 lippincott williams & wilkins.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose: to compare tendon-to-bone healing in remnant-preserving and conventional anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. methods: 72 new zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to conventional acl reconstruction group (group a), remnant-preserving and tensioning acl reconstruction group (group b), and remnant-preserving and graft through remnant sleeve acl reconstruction group (group c), with 24 rabbits (48 knees) in each group. the incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement in each group were analyzed using ct 3d reconstruction. graft tendon-bone healing was monitored by he and masson staining, and osteoprotegerin (opg) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand (rankl) mrna expression in the bone tissue surrounding the graft. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to evaluate the ratio of opg/rankl expression. results: histological analysis showed that group c had the best graft tendon-bone healing, followed by group b and group a at all time-points post-surgery. at weeks 3 and 6 post-surgery, opg mrna levels and opg/rankl values were higher in groups b and c compared to group a (p < 0.05). rankl mrna levels of groups b and c were lower than group a (p0.05). at 3 weeks post-surgery, the incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement were greater in group a compared to groups b and c (p < 0.05). conclusion: both remnant-preserving construction approaches promoted graft tendon-bone healing, the underlying mechanism may be associated with the upregulation of opg mrna and downregulation of rankl mrna in bone tunnel early post-operation.
fluid_mechanics	predicting the final embedment depth of a dynamically installed anchor is a key prerequisite for reliable calculation of anchor capacity. this paper investigates the embedment characteristics of dynamically installed anchors in normally consolidated and overconsolidated clay through a series of centrifuge tests involving a model anchor instrumented with a microelectric mechanical system (mems) accelerometer, enabling the full motion response of the anchor to be established. the data are used to assess the performance of an anchor embedment model based on strain-rate-dependent shearing resistance and fluid mechanics drag resistance. predictions of a database of over 100 anchor installations - formed from this study and the literature - result in calculated anchor embedment depths that are within +/- 15% of the measurements. an interesting aspect, consistent across the entire database, relates to the strain rate dependence on frictional resistance relative to bearing resistance. the predictions reveal that strain rate dependency may indeed be higher for frictional resistance, although only if a soil strength lower than the fully remoulded strength is considered as the reference strength, which suggests that water may be entrained along a boundary layer at the anchor-soil interface during installation.
northern_blotting	both cdna and a genomic dna fragment encoding a new potato proteinase inhibitor ii were isolated from a diploid potato ivp101 (solanum phurejia l.) and named pinii-2x. nucleotide sequencing confirmed that the dna fragment of pinii-2xwas 580 bp, including a 115-bp intron and two exons. the deduced pinii-2x protein contained an intact signal peptide and two active sites. the pinii-2x gene and its deduced pinii-2x protein had 88% and 93% homology with another tetraploid potato proteinase inhibitor ii, respectively. northern blotting analysis indicated that the mrna of pinii-2x gene was wound induced in potato leaves. binary vector pnar301 and pnar302 were constructed for rice transformation, in which the pinii-2x cdna was driven, respectively, by rice actin i promoter (acti) and maize ubiquitin promoter (ubii). via an agrobacterium-mediated method, these two constructs were transferred into japonica rice cv. xiushui 63. pcr and southern blotting analysis for transgenic rice revealed the integration of the pinii-2x gene. northern blotting analysis also confirmed transcripts of the pinii-2x gene in transgenic rice plants. insect bioassays using stripe stem borer (chilo suppressalis walker) demonstrated that the average weight and body length of larvae in transgenic plants were only nearly 50% and 61% of those of larvae in control plants, respectively. these results indicate that the pinii-2x gene should be an effective insect-resistance gene and could be valuable for application in crop breeding for insect resistance.
computer-aided_design	isogeometric analysis (iga) is a new analysis method for unification of computer aided design (cad) and computer aided engineering (cae). with the use of nurbs basis functions for both modelling and analysis, the bottleneck of meshing is avoided and a seamless integration is achieved. the cad and computational geometry concepts in iga are new to the analysis community. though, there is a steady growth of literature, details of calculations, explanations and examples are not reported. the content of the paper is complimentary to the existing literature and addresses the gaps. it includes summary of the literature, overview of the methodology, step-by-step calculations and matlab codes for example problems in static structural and modal analysis in 1-d and 2-d. at appropriate places, comparison with the finite element analysis (fem) is also included, so that those familiar with fem can appreciate iga better.
immunology	objective: to determine if the molecular profiles of endometriotic lesions contain informative measures of inflammation and immune dysfunction that may contribute to better understanding of the interplay between immune dysfunction and inflammation and their contribution to endometriosis pathogenesis. design: immune and inflammation transcriptomic analysis with the use of the nanostring ncounter gx human immunology v2 platform (579 human immune and inflammation-related genes and 15 housekeeping genes). setting: academic university and teaching hospital. intervention(s): none. patient(s): stage iii-iv endometriosis patients with infertility (n = 8) and fertile disease-free control women undergoing tubal ligation (n = 8). menstrual stage was matched to secretory phase in all participants. main outcome measure(s): immune and inflammation transcriptomics quantification from ectopic endometriotic lesions and matched eutopic endometrium from patients. endometria of fertile women served as control subjects. result(s): our results displayed endometriotic lesions as molecularly distinct entities compared with eutopic endometrium and endometrium of control samples; 396 out of 579 screened immune and inflammation-related genes were significantly different in ectopic tissues compared with control endometrium. most importantly, eutopic endometrium of the patients displayed a unique molecular profile compared with the control endometrium (91/579 genes were significantly different), particularly of genes involved in regulation of cell apoptosis and decidualization. conclusion(s): we characterize differential expression of immune-inflammation genes in endometriosis patients, and show molecular distinction of eutopic endometrium of patients compared with control fertile women.

hydraulics	to assess the thermal-hydraulics of a condenser of a typical automotive air conditioning system with maldistribution of intake air, a comprehensive investigation has been taken up. the investigation comprises both experiments and numerical simulations. a special purpose software, coildesigner is used to simulate the heat transfer and fluid dynamics of the multiple channel micro-tube air to refrigerant crossflow condenser. while experimentally the overall performance of the condenser is studied by creating blockages of different types and extents in the inlet air path, simulation results provide the spatial variation of pressure, temperature, heat transfer coefficient, and quality on the tube side, in addition to the overall performance for each of the cases. the simulation results clearly bring out the spatial change in the transport parameters due to a typical blockage. one can compare the effective use of the exchanger area of the heat exchanger for an unblocked and a typically blocked case. the simulation also gives a very reliable prediction of the overall performance as recorded by the experiment.

cell_biology	background: fluorescent proteins have continued to shed light on cell biology since the cdna of wild type green fluorescent protein was first isolated. nowadays, these remarkable proteins are useful tools, not only in basic research, but also in clinical medicine. highlight: by taking advantage of fluorescent protein-based technologies, we identified a signaling network critical for influenza virus internalization and infection. in addition, we developed a highly sensitive biosensor for monitoring kinase activity that utilizes energy transfer between fluorescent proteins. this has led to a high-performance clinical test that enables the prediction of future therapeutic responses and the risk of acquired drug resistance for each individual patient before beginning molecular target therapy. conclusion: technologies that utilize fluorescent proteins, such as the biosensor presented here, should find increasing applications in clinical medicine.

hydraulics	an accurate, fast-running and stable six-group, point kinetics (pk) model is developed and applied successfully to the dynamic simulation of the operation of the prismatic core, high temperature next generation nuclear plant (ngnp) reactor. the model is unrestricted by the size of the time step, which could be as much as several seconds, accounts for doppler broadening and the fuel and graphite temperature reactivity feedbacks, and includes an active neutron source for zero-power reactor startup. an efficient and robust numerical technique that approximates the exponential matrix using 7th order-accurate pade(3,3) function with a discretization error on the order of (delta t)(3), solves the coupled nonlinear and stiff six-groups point kinetics equations. the pk model handles reactivity insertions in excess of a prompt critical, rho/(beta) over bar>$1.0, with unrestrictive time step size. model results are successfully benchmarked using the inhour solution for a step insertion of external reactivity. to simulate the transient response of the ngnp reactor following an external reactivity insertion and during a startup, the pk model is coupled to 84-nodes thermal-hydraulics model of the reactor, also developed in this work. with a 2 s time step, the error of predicting the reactor thermal power is similar to 0.001%, increasing exponentially to similar to 0.08% and similar to 1.5% with increased time step size to 5 and 8 s, respectively. the present pk model has been successfully incorporated into melcor-h-2 nuclear reactor analysis code to simulate transient operation of very high temperature reactor (vhtr) for electricity generation, using a closed brayton cycle turbomachinery, and the co-generation of hydrogen using sulfur iodine (si) thermo-chemical processes.

immunology	respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is an important etiological agent of respiratory infections, particularly in children. much information regarding the immune response to rsv comes from animal models and in vitro studies. here, we provide a comprehensive description of the human immune response to rsv infection, based on a systematic literature review of research on infected humans. there is an initial strong neutrophil response to rsv infection in humans, which is positively correlated with disease severity and mediated by interleukin-8 (il- 8). dendritic cells migrate to the lungs as the primary antigen-presenting cell. an initial systemic t-cell lymphopenia is followed by a pulmonary cd8(+) t-cell response, mediating viral clearance. humoral immunity to reinfection is incomplete, but rsv igg and iga are protective. b-cell-stimulating factors derived from airway epithelium play a major role in protective antibody generation. gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) has a strongly protective role, and a th2-biased response may be deleterious. other cytokines (particularly il-17a), chemokines (particularly ccl-5 and ccl-3), and local innate immune factors (including cathelicidins and ifn-lambda) contribute to pathogenesis. in summary, neutrophilic inflammation is incriminated as a harmful response, whereas cd8(+) t cells and ifn-gamma have protective roles. these may represent important therapeutic targets to modulate the immunopathogenesis of rsv infection.
molecular_biology	the theory of computer science is based around universal turing machines (utms): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. modern digital computers are physical embodiments of classical utms. for the most important class of problem in computer science, non- deterministic polynomial complete problems, non- deterministic utms (nutms) are theoretically exponentially faster than both classical utms and quantum mechanical utms (qutms). however, no attempt has previously been made to build an nutm, and their construction has been regarded as impossible. here, we demonstrate the first physical design of an nutm. this design is based on thue string rewriting systems, and thereby avoids the limitations of most previous dna computing schemes: all the computation is local (simple edits to strings) so there is no need for communication, and there is no need to order operations. the design exploits dna 's ability to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in p time. each thue rewriting step is embodied in a dna edit implemented using a novel combination of polymerase chain reactions and site- directed mutagenesis. we demonstrate that the design works using both computational modelling and in vitro molecular biology experimentation: the design is thermodynamically favourable, microprogramming can be used to encode arbitrary thue rules, all classes of thue rule can be implemented, and non- deterministic rule implementation. in an nutm, the resource limitation is space, which contrasts with classical utms and qutms where it is time. this fundamental difference enables an nutmto trade space for time, which is significant for both theoretical computer science and physics. it is also of practical importance, for to quote richard feynman ` there 's plenty of room at the bottom'. this means that a desktop dna nutm could potentially utilize more processors than all the electronic computers in the world combined, and thereby outperform the world 's current fastest supercomputer, while consuming a tiny fraction of its energy.
computer-aided_design	integrating more functionality in a smaller form factor with higher performance and lower-power consumption is pushing semiconductor technology scaling to its limits. 3-d chip stacking is touted as the silver bullet technology that can keep moore 's momentum and fuel the next wave of consumer electronic products. additionally, the complexity of digital designs imposes that computer-aided design algorithms are getting harder and slower. this paper introduces a framework for application implementation onto 3-d reconfigurable architectures. in contrast to existing approaches, the proposed solution is customizable according to constraints posed by the application and the target 3-d device in order to improve performance metrics. experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our framework, as we achieve average enhancements in terms of maximum operation frequency and power consumption by 35% and 47%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
immunology	accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in the liver contributes to cholestatic liver injury. inflammation induced by excessive bile acids is believed to play a crucial role, however, the mechanisms of bile acids triggered inflammatory response remain unclear. recent studies have highlighted the effect of nlrp3 inflammasome in mediating liver inflammation and fibrosis. in this study, we for the first time showed that chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca), the major hydrophobic primary bile acid involved in cholestatic liver injury, could dose-dependently induce nlrp3 inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine-il-1 beta in macrophages by promoting ros production and k+ efflux. mechanistically, cdca triggered ros formation in part through tgr5/egfr downstream signaling, including protein kinase b, extracellular regulated protein kinases and c-jun n-terminal kinase pathways. meanwhile, cdca also induced atp release from macrophages which subsequently causes k+ efflux via p2x7 receptor. furthermore, in vivo inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasome with caspase-1 inhibitor dramatically decreased mature il-1 beta level of liver tissue and ameliorated liver fibrosis in bile duct ligation (bdl) mouse model. in conclusion, excessive cdca may represent an endogenous danger signal to activate nlrp3 inflammasome and initiate liver inflammation during cholestasis. our finding offers a mechanistic basis to ameliorate cholestatic liver fibrosis by targeting inflammasome activation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	sugarcane grassy shoot (scgs) disease is associated with the presence of 16srxi group phytoplasmas that are transmitted by leafhoppers; limited studies have been performed in india toward its natural transmission. to determine the insect vectors that transmit the disease in nature, leafhopper species from scgs-infected fields at shahjahanpur, central uttar pradesh, india, were collected and analyzed for phytoplasma presence using nested polymerase chain reaction with phytoplasma-specific primers. an similar to 1.2-kb amplified dna fragment was detected in nested pcr from the three major leafhopper species, viz. maiestas portica (melichar), exitianus indicus (ross) and cofana unimaculata (signoret), and the symptomatic sugarcane leaves of variety cos 07250. blastn analysis of similar to 1.2-kb 16s rdna partial sequences obtained from symptomatic sugarcane plants and these leafhoppers revealed 99-100 % sequence identities among themselves and 99 % identity with other reported strains of 'candidatus phytoplasma oryzae' (16srxi group). phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequences of scgs, m. portica, c. unimaculata and e. indicus phytoplasma strains also indicated the closest phylogenetic relationship with those of 'ca. p. oryzae' group. transmission tests and population sampling study further confirmed that m. portica and c. unimaculata were vectors of the scgs phytoplasma from diseased to healthy sugarcane plants. the identification of new vectors of scgs phytoplasma suggested that these leafhopper species may be responsible for secondary spread of scgs phytoplasma.
molecular_biology	parasitic worms of the genus trichinella (phylum nematoda; class enoplea) represent a complex of at least twelve taxa that infect a range of different host animals, including humans, around the world. they are foodborne, intracellular nematodes, and their life cycles differ substantially from those of other nematodes. the recent characterization of the genomes and transcriptomes of all twelve recognized taxa of trichinella now allows, for the first time, detailed studies of their molecular biology. in the present study, we defined, curated, and compared the protein kinase complements (kinomes) of trichinella spiralis and t. pseudospiralis using an integrated bioinformatic workflow employing transcriptomic and genomic data sets. we examined how variation in the kinome might link to unique aspects of trichinella morphology, biology, and evolution. furthermore, we utilized in silico structural modeling to discover and characterize a novel, mos-like kinase with an unusual, previously undescribed n-terminal domain. taken together, the present findings provide a basis for comparative investigations of nematode kinomes, and might facilitate the identification of enoplea-specific intervention and diagnostic targets. importantly, the in silico modeling approach assessed here provides an exciting prospect of being able to identify and classify currently unknown (orphan) kinases, as a foundation for their subsequent structural and functional investigation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the metastatic detection rate can vary according to the approach adopted in the microscopic analysis of the lns, which includes frozen-section examination, total inclusion of the tissue with and without whole-mount sections, serial sectioning, and the application of immunohistochemistry. the assessment of the sentinel ln, the search for micrometastases, and the evaluation of atypical ln metastatic sites further contribute to the detection of the metastatic spread. in this review, an update on the histopathological evaluation of lnd specimens in patients with pca is given, and focus is made on their clinical and prognostic significance.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the current study aimed to investigate the potential role of mir-9 in the inhibition of ovarian cancer progression through the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sdf-1)/ c-x-c chemokine receptor type 4 (cxcr4) pathway and to provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. human ovarian cancer ovcar-3 cells were transfected with mir-9 short hairpin rna (shrna). the effect of mir-9 on the mrna expression levels of cxcr4 were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. the effects of mir-9 on ovcar-3 cell proliferation, invasion and apoptotic ability were detected using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, matrigel method, and annexin v-fluorescein isothiocyanate flow cytometry, respectively. in addition, expression levels of sdf-1/cxcr4 pathway associated proteins were determined by western blot analysis. mrna expression levels of cxcr4 in ovcar-3 cells transfected with mir-9 shrna was significantly downregulated compared with the blank and control groups (p<0.05). furthermore, compared with the two control groups, the current results revealed that mir-9 inhibited cell proliferation, suppressed invasive ability and induced cell apoptosis in ovcar-3 cells (p<0.05). finally, it was observed that mir-9 functioned as a tumor inhibitor through the sdf-1/cxcr4 pathway by suppressing the expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (erk1), erk2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 proteins. the present study suggested that mir-9 may function as a promising tumor inhibitor for ovarian cancer through targeting the sdf-1/cxcr4 pathway.
molecular_biology	echinococcus granulosus (eg) is the major cause of cystic echinococcosis in humans and livestock in the world. in chile is a zoonosis of great importance. the most frequently affected geographic areas are the regions of aysen, los rios, los lagos, coquimbo and the araucania. hence, it was discovered that in endemic areas of hydatidosis there could be several strains and genotypes of eg. in addition, there is evidence that some strains and genotypes are more infectious for human beings than others. this interesting phenomenon of the biology of eg has been studied using molecular biology techniques based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna sequence analysis, which has made it possible to characterize the cestode species complex called eg sensu lato (s l) as being comprised of eg sensu stricto (s. s.) (genotypes g1-g3), e. equinus (g4), e. ortleppi (g5) and e. canadensis (g6-g10), which present an important phenotypic variation detectable in characteristics of the biological cycle, specificity of the intermediate host, pattern of development, pathogenicity, antigenicity, transmission dynamics and, consequently, in the measures needed to control the disease. the aim of this manuscript is to describe the different genotypes of eg described in humans and different livestock host reported in the literature.
human_metabolism	introduction in the almost six decades of bariatric surgery, a variety of surgical approaches to treating morbid obesity have been developed. history and evolution rather than prior techniques being continually superseded by new ones, a broad choice of surgical solutions based on restrictive, malabsorptive, humoral effects, or combinations thereof, is now available. in fact, in recent years, the advent of surgically modifying human metabolism promises new approaches to ameliorate traditionally medically treated metabolic entities, i.e., diabetes, even in the non-obese. the understanding of the various metabolic effects have led to a paradigm shift from bariatric surgery as a solely weight-reducing procedure to metabolic surgery affecting whole body metabolism. conclusion the bariatric surgeon now faces the challenge and opportunity of selecting the most suitable technique for each individual case. to assist in such decision-making, this review, metabolic surgery-principles and current concepts, is presented, tracing the historical development; describing the various surgical techniques; elucidating the mechanisms by which glycemic control can be achieved that involve favorable changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, gut hormones, adipokines, energy expenditure, appetite, and preference for low glycemic index foods; as well as exploring the fascinating future potential of this new interdisciplinary field.
human_metabolism	animal models are used to study many aspects of human disease and to test therapeutic interventions. however, some very important features of human biology cannot be replicated in animals, even in nonhuman primates or transgenic rodents engineered with human genes. most human microbial pathogens do not infect animals and the metabolism of many xenobiotics is different between human beings and animals. the advent of transgenic immune-deficient mice has made it possible to generate chimeric animals harboring human tissues and cells, including hepatocytes. the liver plays a central role in many human-specific biological processes and mice with humanized livers can be used to model human metabolism, liver injury, gene regulation, drug toxicity, and hepatotropic infections.
cell_biology	progress in biomaterial science and engineering and increasing knowledge in cell biology have enabled us to develop functional biomaterials providing appropriate biochemical and biophysical cues for tissue regeneration applications. tissue regeneration is particularly important to treat chronic wounds of people with diabetes. understanding and controlling the cellular microenvironment of the wound tissue are important to improve the wound healing process. in this study, we review different biochemical (e.g., growth factors, peptides, dna, and rna) and biophysical (e.g., topographical guidance, pressure, electrical stimulation, and pulsed electromagnetic field) cues providing a functional and instructive acellular matrix to heal diabetic chronic wounds. the biochemical and biophysical signals generally regulate cell-matrix interactions and cell behavior and function inducing the tissue regeneration for chronic wounds. some technologies and devices have already been developed and used in the clinic employing biochemical and biophysical cues for wound healing applications. these technologies can be integrated with smart biomaterials to deliver therapeutic agents to the wound tissue in a precise and controllable manner. this review provides useful guidance in understanding molecular mechanisms and signals in the healing of diabetic chronic wounds and in designing instructive biomaterials to treat them.
human_metabolism	purpose the presence of activated brown adipose tissue (abat) has been associated with a reduced risk of obesity in adults. we aimed to investigate whether the presence of abat in patients undergoing f-18-fdg pet/ct examinations was related to blood lipid profiles, liver function, and the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld). methods we retrospectively and prospectively analysed the f-18-fdg pet/ct scans from 5,907 consecutive patients who were referred to the nuclear medicine department of the marmara university school of medicine from outpatient oncology clinics between july 2008 and june 2014 for a variety of diagnostic reasons. attenuation coefficients for the liver and spleen were determined for at least five different areas. blood samples were obtained before pet/ct to assess the blood lipid profiles and liver function. results a total of 25 of the 5,907 screened individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the study demonstrated brown fat tissue uptake [abat(+) subjects]. after adjustment for potential confounders, 75 individuals without evidence of abat on pet [abat(-) subjects] were enrolled for comparison purposes. the abat(+) group had lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase levels (p < 0.01), whereas we found no significant differences in the serum triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between the two groups. the prevalence of nafld was significantly lower in abat(+) than in abat(-) subjects (p < 0.01). conclusion our study showed that the presence of abat in adults had a positive effect on their blood lipid profiles and liver function and was associated with reduced prevalence of nafld. thus, our data suggest that activating brown adipose tissue may be a potential target for preventing and treating dyslipidaemia and nafld.
internal_combustion_engine	power generation from biomass gasification through the use of spark ignition engines requires the cooling of the biomass syngas to avoid knock. this cooling leads to the condensation of tar impurities, which foul and clog up critical process components leading to significant maintenance issues and costs. conventionally, tar related problems are addressed by optimizing the gasification process along with developing tar purification systems, both of which result in increased investment and maintenance costs. a novel method is being developed at the universite catholique de louvain, where the entire process, from the exit of the biomass gasifier to the combustion of tar loaded impure syngas in an internal combustion engine, is carried out at a temperature of 250 degrees c, thereby avoiding tar condensation and its consequent problems. a homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) engine is utilized for such a high intake temperature operation. this paper describes the first experiments with an impure and hot biomass syngas, produced from a two-stage gasifier, which is burned in a hcci engine without the intermediate cooling and tar purification steps. the objective of the experiment was to test the stability of the engine in response to the naturally occurring random variations in the syngas composition. the experiments were carried out over a continuous period of 24 h. indicated efficiencies of 33%-39% and imep around 2.5 bar were observed while the emissions of nox were relatively high, probably due to the presence of ammonia in the syngas. the implementation of a closed control loop, with the combustion phasing as the feedback parameter and the fueling rate as the controlled parameter, ensured a stable operation over the experimental duration.

southern_blotting	exotoxins produced by actinobacillus (a.) pleuropneumoniae (apx) play major roles in the pathogenesis of pleuropneumonia in swine. this study investigated the role of apxi in hemolysis and cellular damage using a novel apxia mutant, apxia336, which was developed from the parental strain a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 10 that produces only apxi in vitro. the genotype of apxia336 was confirmed by pcr, southern blotting, and gene sequencing. exotoxin preparation derived from apxia336 was analyzed for its bioactivity towards porcine erythrocytes and alveolar macrophages. analysis results indicated that apxia336 contained a kanamycin-resistant cassette inserted immediately after 1005 bp of the apxia gene. phenotype analysis of apxia336 revealed no difference in the growth rate as compared to the parental strain. meanwhile, apxi production was abolished in the bacterial culture supernatant, i.e. exotoxin preparation. the inability of apxia336 to produce apxi corresponded to the loss of hemolytic and cytotoxic bioactivity in exotoxin preparation, as demonstrated by hemolysis, lactate dehydrogenase release, mitochondrial activity, and apoptosis assays. additionally, the virulence of apxia336 appeared to be attenuated by 15-fold in balb/c mice. collectively, apxi, but not other components in the exotoxin preparation of a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 10, was responsible for the hemolytic and cytotoxic effects on porcine erythrocytes and alveolar macrophages.
cell_biology	chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a myeloproliferative disease with a characteristic bcr-abl tyrosine kinase (tk) fusion protein. despite the clinical efficacy accomplished by tkis therapies, disease progression may affect patient response rate to these inhibitors due to a multitude of factors that could lead to development of a mechanism known as multidrug resistance (mdr). 7-ketocholesterol (7kc) is an oxidized cholesterol derivative that has been extensively reported to cause cell death in a variety of cancer models. in this study, we showed the in vitro efficacy of 7kc against mdr leukemia cell line, lucena. 7kc treatment induced reduction in cell viability, together with apoptosis-mediated cell death. moreover, downregulation of mdr protein caused intracellular drug accumulation and 7kc co-incubation with either daunorubicin or vincristine reduced cell viability compared to the use of each drug alone. additionally, quantitative label-free mass spectrometry-based protein quantification showed alteration of different molecular pathways involved in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and misfolded protein response. conclusively, this study highlights the effect of 7kc as a sensitizing agent of multi drug resistance cml and elucidates its molecular mechanisms. significance: cml patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) have showed a 5-year estimated overall survival of 89%, with cumulative complete cytogenetic response of 87%. however, development of drug resistance is a common feature of the disease progression. this study aimed at showing the effect of 7kc as a cytotoxic and sensitizing agent of multidrug resistance cml cell lines. the cellular and molecular basis of this compound were elucidated using a comprehensive strategy based on quantitative proteomic and cell biology assays. we showed that 7kc induced cell death and overcomes drug resistance in cml through mechanisms that go beyond the classical mdr1 pathways.

genetics	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of upper and lower motor neurons. despite intensive research, the origin and progression of als remain largely unknown, suggesting that the traditional clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies might not be adequate to completely capture the molecular complexity underlying the disease. in our previous work, comprehensive genomic profiling of 41 motor cortex samples enabled to discriminate control from sporadic als patients and segregated these latter into two distinct subgroups, each associated with different deregulated genes and pathways. interestingly, some deregulated genes in sporadic als were previously associated with familiar als, indicating shared pathogenic mechanisms between the two forms of disease. in this, we performed cluster analysis on the same whole-genome expression profiles using a restricted (203) subset of genes extensively implicated in monogenic forms of als. surprisingly, this short and unbiased gene list was sufficiently representative to allow the accurate separation of sals patients from controls and the stratification of sals patients into two molecularly distinct subgroups. overall, our findings support the existence of a molecular taxonomy for als and represent a further step toward the establishment of a molecular-based diagnosis and patient-tailored therapies.
immunology	arctic wildlife can be exposed to high mercury (hg) levels, and are also naturally exposed to gastrointestinal parasites that can reduce condition and negatively affect reproductive output and/or survival in similar ways. importantly, both hg and parasites are increasing in wildlife in some arctic regions. we studied the northern common eider duck (somateria mollissima) to explore how hg in association with both natural levels and experimentally reduced parasitic infections, affect reproduction and survival. female eiders were measured, banded, and blood sampled to determine blood hg burdens, prior to breeding. propensity to nest, clutch size, nest survival, nest attendance, and return rates were assessed in relation to both hg burden and parasite treatment. neither reproduction nor return rates of females varied with hg concentrations, but females arriving late to the colony, or in low body condition, showed increased nesting propensity when given the anti-parasite treatment as compared to placebo treatment. our results suggest that parasites can play a critical role in decisions to invest in avian breeding annually, particularly among individuals with a late onset to breeding, and in poor condition. crown copyright (c) 2016 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
machine_design	the interest for permanent magnet (pm) synchronous machines equipped with fractional-slot concentrated winding is more and more increasing in recent years. among the others the surface mounted pm machines (spm) have been widely selected from motor manufacturers. particularly attractive are the spoke-type interior pm (ipm) machines. nowadays, pm machines are often selected for variable speed applications without precise positioning requirements taking the advantage of sensorless control algorithms. nevertheless the capability to detect the electrical rotor position without sensor also at zero speed, by means of techniques based on high-frequency signal injection, is an enhancing feature that requires a proper machine design. the aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of both rotor and stator modifications taking a commercial motor as a reference geometry. the analysis of two rotor structures, spm and ipm, as well as stator tooth geometry variations pointed out how the machine response due the injection of an high frequency voltage is significantly affected by the stator iron saturation. finite elements simulations have been confirmed by test on two ipm motors manufactured with different stator design.
immunology	neutrophils (pmn) are best known for their phagocytic functions against invading pathogens and microorganisms. they have the shortest half-life amongst leukocytes and in their non-activated state are constitutively committed to apoptosis. when recruited to inflammatory sites to resolve inflammation, they produce an array of cytotoxic molecules with potent antimicrobial killing. yet, when these powerful cytotoxic molecules are released in an uncontrolled manner they can damage surrounding tissues. in recent years however, neutrophil versatility is increasingly evidenced, by demonstrating plasticity and immunoregulatory functions. we have recently identified a new neutrophil-derived subpopulation, which develops spontaneously in standard culture conditions without the addition of cytokines/growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf)/interleukin (il)-4. their phagocytic abilities of neutrophil remnants largely contribute to increase their size immensely; therefore they were termed giant phagocytes (g phi). unlike neutrophils, g phi are long lived in culture. they express the cluster of differentiation (cd) neutrophil markers cd66b/cd63/cd15/cd11b/myeloperoxidase (mpo)/neutrophil elastase (ne), and are devoid of the monocytic lineage markers cd14/cd16/cd163 and the dendritic cd1c/cd141 markers. they also take-up latex and zymosan, and respond by oxidative burst to stimulation with opsonized-zymosan and pma. g phi also express the scavenger receptors cd68/cd36, and unlike neutrophils, internalize oxidized-low density lipoprotein (oxldl). moreover, unlike fresh neutrophils, or cultured monocytes, they respond to oxldl uptake by increased reactive oxygen species (ros) production. additionally, these phagocytes contain microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3b (lc3b) coated vacuoles, indicating the activation of autophagy. using specific inhibitors it is evident that both phagocytosis and autophagy are prerequisites for their development and likely nadph oxidase dependent ros. we describe here a method for the preparation of this new subpopulation of long-lived, neutrophil-derived phagocytic cells in culture, their identification and their currently known characteristics. this protocol is essential for obtaining and characterizing g phi in order to further investigate their significance and functions.
human_metabolism	this work shows that the main photochemical pathways of acetaminophen (apap) transformation in surface waters would be direct photolysis (with quantum yield of (4.57 +/- 0.17).10(-2)), reaction with co3- (most significant at ph >7, with second-order rate constant of (3.8 +/- 1.1).10(8) m-1 s(-1)) and possibly, for dissolved organic carbon higher than 5 mg c l-1, reaction with the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((cdom)-c-3*). the modelled photochemical half-life time of apap in environmental waters would range from days to few weeks in summertime, which suggests that the importance of phototransformation might be comparable to biodegradation. apap transformation by the main photochemical pathways yields hydroxylated derivatives, ring-opening compounds as well as dimers and trimers (at elevated concentration levels). in the case of (cdom)-c-3* (for which the triplet state of anthraquinone-2-sulphonate was used as proxy), ring rearrangement is also hypothesised. photochemistry would produce different transformation products (tps) of apap than microbial biodegradation or human metabolism, thus the relevant tps might be used as markers of apap photochemical reaction pathways in environmental waters.

molecular_biology	obesity continues to be a major global problem. various cancers are related to obesity and proper understanding of their aetiology, especially their molecular tumour biology is important for early diagnosis and better treatment. genes play an important role in the development of obesity. few genes such as leptin, leptin receptor encoded by the db (diabetes), pro-opiomelanocortin, agrp and npy and melanocortin-4 receptors and insulin-induced gene 2 were linked to obesity. micrornas control gene expression via mrna degradation and protein translation inhibition and influence cell differentiation, cell growth and cell death. overexpression of mir-143 inhibits tumour growth by suppressing b cell lymphoma 2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 activities and kras oncogene. cancers of the breast, uterus, renal, thyroid and liver are also related to obesity. any disturbance in the production of sex hormones and insulin, leads to distortion in the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. the possible mechanism linking obesity to cancer involves alteration in the level of adipokines and sex hormones. these mediators act as biomarkers for cancer progression and act as targets for cancer therapy and prevention. interestingly, many anti-cancerous drugs are also beneficial in treating obesity and vice versa. we also reviewed the possible link in the mechanism of few drugs which act both on cancer and obesity. the present review may be important for molecular biologists, oncologists and clinicians treating cancers and also pave the way for better therapeutic options.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: ovarian cancer is the leading lethal, gynecological malignancy in the united states. no doubt, the continued morbidity and mortality of ovarian cancer reflects a poor understanding of invasive mechanisms. recent studies reveal that ovarian cancers express aberrant micrornas (mirnas or mirs), some of which have oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties. several studies suggested that mir-205 is involved in tumorigenesis. presently, we investigate the molecular mechanisms and target of mir-205 in ovarian cancer. methods: quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were performed to assess mir-205 and transcription factor 21 (tcf21) expression in ovarian cancer and normal ovary samples. the effect of mir-205 on tcf21 was determined by luciferase reporter assay and western blot. the effect of mir-205 and tcf21 on cell invasion was quantitated using transwell invasion assay. result: mir-205 expression was increased in ovarian cancer and it promoted the invasive behavior of ovarian cancer cell lines (ovcar-5, ovcar-8 and skov-3). mir-205 directly targeted tcf21, which was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissue. mir-205 inhibited tcf21 expression and as a consequence blunted the inhibitory effect of tcf21 on cell invasion. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. tcf21 inhibited mmp-2 and mmp-10 and decreased ovarian cancer cell invasion. co-transfection of tcf21 expression plasmid with mir-205 mimic diminished the inhibitory effect of tcf21 on mmp-2 and mmp-10 in ovarian cancer cells. conclusion: mir-205 appears to have an important role in the spread of ovarian cancer by targeting tcf21. these findings offer a new mechanism of ovarian cancer tumorigenesis, which could be useful for the development of new therapeutic approaches to ovarian cancer treatment.
strength_of_materials	a stochastic model of nonisothermal creep and long-term strength of metallic materials is proposed. experimental data on the creep of the zhs6kp alloy at temperatures equal to 900, 950, and 1000a degrees c are stochastically analyzed. these experimental data are used to substantiate the hypotheses applied in constructing the model. the stochastic model is checked for adequacy to the experimental data on the creep of the zhs6kp alloy under stationary and nonstationary loading conditions. it is shown that the calculated and experimental data are in satisfactory agreement.
northern_blotting	the shape of the inflorescence in arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia is a raceme with individual flowers developing acropetally. the ecotype landsberg harboring the erecta (er) mutation shows a corymb-like inflorescence, namely a compact inflorescence with a flattened arrangement of flower buds at the tip. to gain insight into inflorescence development, we previously isolated corymb-like inflorescence mutants, named corymbosal (crm1), and found that the corymb-like inflorescence in crm1-1 was due to reduced cell elongation of pedicels and stem internodes. double mutants of crm1 with er and crm2, and crm1-1 crm2-1 er-105 triple mutants show an additive phenotype. crm1-1 is caused by a mutation in big, which is required for polar auxin transport. crm1/big is expressed in inflorescence meristems, floral meristems and vascular tissues. we analyzed a collection of 12 reduced lateral root formation (rlr) mutants, which are allelic to crm1-1, and categorized the mutants into three classes, depending on the plant developmental defects. although all 12 alleles had new stop codons, the phenotype of heterozygous crm1-1/doc1-1 and northern blotting suggest that new crm1/big mutant alleles are hypomorphic. auxin-responsive dr5rev::gfp expression was decreased in crm1-1 vasculature of pedicels and stem internodes. pinformed1 (pin1) and crm1/big are expressed in vasculature of pedicels and stem internodes. the severity of corymb-like inflorescence in crm1/big mutants correlated with increased levels of pin1. our results suggest that crm1/big controls the elongation of the pedicels and stem internodes through auxin action.
genetics	we report herein results of a study performed in the balearic islands which had the following goals: 1) determine the proportion of pregnant or non-pregnant women planning pregnancy, who would choose to undergo a screening test for fragile x syndrome (fxs), if it is accompanied by the appropriate information; 2) assess satisfaction and any increase in stress among women who participate in screening; 3) collect epidemiological information about the incidence of the disease in our population; and 4) collect demographic and health history data and assess participants' awareness of the disease. screening was performed on 3,731 pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age and the results indicate: a very high voluntary rate of participation; a high level of self-reported satisfaction and low levels of stress because of the test; a very high incidence of premutation (1/106) in our population; and a low level of awareness about the existence of fxs (25 %). additional findings indicate no significant correlation between self-reported health history and premutation detection, and the high premutation incidence does not seem to be specific to the indigenous balearic population. based on these results, we discuss the pros and cons of an implementation of preconception and pregnant women screening for fxs within a public health screening program.
polymerase_chain_reaction	1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-dcp) and dichloromethane (dcm) are possible causative agents associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma in employees working in printing plant in osaka, japan. however, few reports have demonstrated an association between these agents and cholangiocarcinoma in rodent carcinogenicity studies. moreover, the combined effects of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. in the present study, we evaluated the in vivo mutagenicity of 1,2-dcp and dcm, alone or combined, in the livers of gpt delta rats. six-week-old male f344 gpt delta rats were treated with 1,2-dcp, dcm or 1,2-dcp+dcm by oral administration for 4weeks at the dose (200mgkg(-1) body weight 1,2-dcp and 500mgkg(-1) body weight dcm) used in the carcinogenesis study performed by the national toxicology program. in vivo mutagenicity was analyzed by gpt mutation/spi(-) assays in the livers of rats. in addition, gene and protein expression of cyp2e1 and gstt1, the major enzymes responsible for the genotoxic effects of 1,2-dcp and dcm, were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. gpt and spi(-) mutation frequencies were not increased by 1,2-dcp and/or dcm in any group. additionally, there were no significant changes in the gene and protein expression of cyp2e1 and gstt1 in any group. these results indicated that 1,2-dcp, dcm and 1,2-dcp+dcm had no significant impact on mutagenicity in the livers of gpt delta rats under our experimental conditions. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
internal_combustion_engine	on account of increasingly strict needs on engine efficiency and emission control, the fuel to air ratio (far) control arrangements for internal combustion engines (ices) are still incessantly developed. the effects of time delay limit the far controller gains and degrade the system performance. this paper addresses a control system design for far in ices that suffer from unknown time-delay induced due to several reasons such as unknown evaporation time, unknown fuel quantity injected into the combustion process, and an imperfection in the model used to describe far and its relation to the surrounding factors that affect the combustion process. a new theorem is proposed in this context depending on routh-hurwitz technique and manipulating poles cancellation control method to achieve the required control action. a mathematical proof is introduced for the proposed theorem and a numerical simulation is performed to illustrate the validity of the control scheme.
enzymology	background: dna-pkcs stimulates the endonucleolytic activities of artemis but not the 5-exonuclease activity. results: point mutagenesis, small molecule inhibitors, and modulation of divalent cation concentrations all affect both the endonuclease and 5-exonuclease activities in parallel. conclusion: artemis has intrinsic 5-exonuclease activity, in addition to its known endonuclease activity. significance: artemis may use both its endo- and its 5-exonuclease activity in nhej. artemis is a member of the metallo--lactamase protein family. artemis has endonuclease activity at dna hairpins and at 5- and 3-dna overhangs of duplex dna, and this endonucleolytic activity is dependent upon dna-pkcs. there has been uncertainty about whether artemis also has 5-exonuclease activity on single-stranded dna and 5-overhangs, because this 5-exonuclease is not dependent upon dna-pkcs. here, we show that the 5-exonuclease and the endonuclease activities co-purify. second, we show that a point mutant of artemis at a putative active site residue (h115a) markedly reduces both the endonuclease activity and the 5-exonuclease activity. third, divalent cation effects on the 5-exonuclease and the endonuclease parallel one another. fourth, both the endonuclease activity and 5-exonuclease activity of artemis can be blocked in parallel by small molecule inhibitors, which do not block unrelated nucleases. we conclude that the 5-exonuclease is intrinsic to artemis, making it relevant to the role of artemis in nonhomologous dna end joining.
immunology	background: alloimmunization against human platelet antigens (hpas) can occur prenatally and induce fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (fnait). the aim of this study was to identify placental histological features associated with platelet alloimmunization and their clinical significance. methods: this study examined 21 placentas from fnait-affected pregnancies and 42 age-matched control cases, all collected from pathology departments in the rhone-alpes region. clinical and laboratory findings were collected for each fnait case. two pathologists reviewed the placental slides of each fnait and control case. histological features, with special emphasis on chronic inflammatory lesions, were evaluated. differences between the two groups were calculated with odds ratios (ors) and assessed with wald 's chi-square. results: fnait was associated with a significantly higher frequency of chronic chorioamnionitis (cc) (or 14, 95%cl 1.7-113.8), basal chronic villitis (bcv) (or 17, 95%ci 2-145.6) and chronic intervillositis (civ). chronic villitis (cv) (or 3.7, 95%ci 0.9-15.2) and chronic deciduitis (cd) (or 4.7, 95%ci 0.79-28.2) were also more frequent in the fnait than the control group, but these differences were not statistically significant. conclusions: fnait is significantly associated with cc, bcv, and civ. this chronic inflammatory reaction is preferentially localized on the maternofetal interface. anti-hpa alloimmunization may trigger an immunological conflict similar to graft-versus-host disease.

genetics	five species of whale with matrilineal social systems (daughters remain with mothers) have remarkably low levels of mitochondrial dna diversity. non-heritable matriline-level demography could reduce genetic diversity but the required conditions are not consistent with the natural histories of the matrilineal whales. the diversity of nuclear microsatellites is little reduced in the matrilineal whales arguing against bottlenecks. selective sweeps of the mitochondrial genome are feasible causes but it is not clear why these only occurred in the matrilineal species. cultural hitchhiking (cultural selection reducing diversity at neutral genetic loci transmitted in parallel to the culture) is supported in sperm whales which possess suitable matrilineal socio-cultural groups (coda clans). killer whales are delineated into ecotypes which likely originated culturally. culture, bottlenecks and selection, as well as their interactions, operating between- or within-ecotypes, may have reduced their mitochondrial diversity. the societies, cultures and genetics of false killer and two pilot whale species are insufficiently known to assess drivers of low mitochondrial diversity.
cell_biology	diet-induced obesity can lead to detrimental chronic disorders. the severity of this global epidemic has encouraged ongoing research to characterize the mechanisms underlying obesity and its comorbidities. recent evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids (sea) in high-fat diets rapidly generate inflammation in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (arc), which centrally regulates whole-body energy homeostasis. herein, we will review the roles of hypothalamic neurons and resident microglia in the initiation of sfa-induced hypothalamic inflammation. particularly, we focus on neuronal and microglial free fatty acid-sensing and capacity to produce inflammatory signaling. we also outline a potential role of peripherally-derived monocytes in this inflammation. and finally, we explore synaptic plasticity as a mechanism through which hypothalamic inflammation can modulate arc circuitry, and thus disrupt energy homeostasis.

immunology	chronic granulomatous disease (cgd), a disease characterized by inadequate neutrophil killing of microbial pathogens, affects 4 to 5 per million live births. for many decades following its description, cgd was a fatal disease in childhood. with the development of effective preventive therapies and the early recognition of infectious complications, 90% of children with cgd now survive into adulthood. the management of cgd in adults includes unique challenges and potential disease manifestations. in this article, the authors discuss the current approach to the management of cgd in both children and adults. this includes a focus on the importance of a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach in the care of cgd and its potential complications. in addition, a novel approach to improving education about cgd, and subsequently improving adherence to preventive therapies, is discussed.

enzymology	ap endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester bond 5'- to the ap (apurinic or apyrimidinic) sites and is one of the major enzymes involved in base excision repair. so far, the properties of several archaeal ap endonuclease homologues have been characterized in vitro, but little is known about their functions in vivo. herein, we report on the biochemical and genetic analysis of two ap endonucleases, sisexoiii and sisendoiv, from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon sulfolobus islandicus rey15a. both sisexoiii and sisendoiv exhibit ap endonuclease activity, but neither of them has 3'-5' exonuclease activity. sisexoiii and sisendoiv have similar k (m) values on the substrate containing an ap site, but the latter cleaves the ap substrate at a dramatically higher catalytic rate than the former. unlike other ap endonucleases identified in archaea, sisexoiii and sisendoiv do not exhibit any cleavage activity on dna having oxidative damage (8-oxo-dg) or uracil. genetic analysis revealed that neither gene is essential for cell viability, and the growth of a dagger sire_2666 (endoiv), a dagger sire_0100 (exoiii), and a dagger sire_0100a dagger sire_2666 is not affected under normal growth conditions. however, a dagger sire_2666 exhibits higher sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (mms) than a dagger sire_0100. over-expression of sire_0100 can partially complement the sensitivity of a dagger sire_2666 to mms, suggesting a backup role of sisexoiii in ap site processing in vivo. intriguingly, over-expression of sisendoiv renders the strain more sensitive to mms than the control. taken together, we conclude that sisendoiv, but not sisexoiii, is the main ap endonuclease that participates directly in base excision repair in s. islandicus.
immunology	cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection occurs frequently in young children, who, when infected, are then a major source of transmission. oral cmv shedding by 14 infants with primary infection was comprehensively characterized using quantitative polymerase chain reaction weekly for >= 9 months. three phases of oral shedding were identified: expansion, transition, and clearance. viral expansion occurred over a median of 7 weeks, with a median doubling time of 3 days. during the transition phase, expansion slowed over a median of 6 weeks before peak viral load was reached. clearance was slow (22-day median half-life), and shedding did not resolve during observation for any infant. mathematical modeling demonstrated that prolonged oral cmv expansion is explained by a low within-host reproduction number (median, 1.63) and a delayed immune response that only decreases the infected cell half-life by 44%. thus, the prolonged oral cmv shedding observed during primary infection can be explained by slow viral expansion and inefficient immunologic control.
human_metabolism	background: there is evidence that adipocytokines play an important role in metabolism and in inflammation. because human metabolism dramatically changes in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and chronic inflammation is the hallmark of the disease, we studied serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn 's disease (cd) in comparison with healthy controls (hc). methods: leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and active ghrelin serum levels were measured in 100 ibd patients (46 uc and 54 cd) and in 60 matched hc using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin levels were correlated with disease activity, type, localization, and treatment. results: mean serum leptin levels were 10.6 +/- 2.0 ng/ml in uc patients, 12.5 +/- 2.6 ng/ml in cd patients, and 15.0 +/- 1.8 ng/rnl in hc (p = .01). mean serum adiponectin levels were 9514.8 +/- 787.8 ng/ml in uc patients, 7651.1 +/- 613 ng/ml in cd patients, and 7270.6 +/- 559.4 ng/ml in hc (p = .05). mean serum resistin levels were 21.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml in uc patients, 18.7 +/- 1.6 ng/ml in cd patients and 11.8 +/- 0.6 ng/ml in hc (p = .0002). mean serum ghrelin levels were 48.2 +/- 4.2 pg/ml in uc patients, 49.4 +/- 4.6 pg/ml in cd patients and 14.8 +/- 3.0 pg/ml in hc (p < .0001). serum levels of these adipocytokines were not correlated with either c-reactive protein levels or the clinical indices of activity. no association between serum adipocytokines levels and disease localization in both uc and cd patients was found. only serum ghrelin was significantly higher in ileal compared with colonic cd (p = .04). conclusions: serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, and active ghrelin are increased whereas serum levels of leptin are decreased in patients with ibd. further studies are needed to elucidate the role of adipocytokines in ibd.

southern_blotting	type-a spermatogonia first appear at between 3-7 d postnatally in mice and are the only immortalized diploid cells that reproduce in adulthood in these animals. in our current study, we explored the feasibility of producing stable transgenic mice using these cells. enhanced pegfp-n1 plasmids were suspended in exgen500 transfection reagent and injected at different angles into the testes of 7-d-old male icr mice. the resulting type-a spermatogonia-mediated gene transfer (tasmgt) mice were then mated with normal females at different stages of sexual maturity (6, 12, and 24 wk). the integration and expression of the introduced egfp gene was evaluated in the f(1) transgenic offspring by pcr and southern blotting analysis. the foreign gene integration rates for a low-dose group (15 mu l gene suspension injected into each testis) and a high-dose group (30 mu l suspensions injected) at the three stages of female sexual maturity tested were 11.76% (2/17), 14.29% (3/21), and 11.11% (2/18), and 5% (1/20), 5.56% (1/18), and 0 (0/17), respectively. the average integration rates for these two dose groups were 12.5% (7/56) and 3.64% (2/55), respectively, which was a significant difference (p<0.05). semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis further showed that the introduced gfp gene was expressed in 3/9 integration mice. in addition, gfp expression was observed in the sperm cells from the tasmgt mice, and also in the embryos and f(2) pups from the f(1) generation transgenic mice. hence, although the foreign gene integration rate for tasmgt is not high and the transgenic offspring show as yet unexplained defects, our results indicate that this method is a potentially feasible and reproducible new approach to creating transgenic mice.
northern_blotting	objective: normalization of mrna data, i.e., the calculation of mrna expression values comparable in between different experiments, is a major issue in biomedical and orthopaedic/rheumatology research, both for single-gene technologies [northern blotting, conventional and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr)] and large-scale gene expression experiments. in this study, we tested several established normalization methods for their effects on gene expression measurements. method. five standard normalization strategies were applied on a previously published data set comparing peripheral and central late stage osteoarthritic cartilage samples. results: the different normalization procedures had profound effects on the distribution as well as the significance values of the gene expression levels. all applied normalization procedures, except the median absolute deviation scaling, showed a bias towards up- or down-regulation of genes as visualized in volcano plots. of interest, the p-values were much more depending on the normalization procedure than the fold changes. ten commonly used housekeeping genes showed a significant variability in between the different specimens investigated. the gene expression analysis by cdna arrays was confirmed for these genes by qpcr. conclusion: this study documents how much normalization strategies influence the outcome of gene expression profiling analysis (i.e., the detection of regulated genes). different normalization approaches can significantly change the p-values and fold changes of a large number of genes. thus, it is of vital importance to check every individual step of gene expression data analysis for its appropriateness. the use of global robustness and quality measures for analyzing individual outcomes can help in estimating the reliability of final microarray study results.

machine_design	most of the electrical machines design studies found in literature lie on the concept that the design under investigation (and optimization) focuses mainly on the geometrical aspects of the machine and thus takes into account only a certain ferromagnetic material (i.e. iron) for its parts. these studies, give little or no information about the influence of material alternatives on the same (and optimized) design. from a manufacturers' point of view though, this information is crucial especially nowadays that there are a lot of commercially available materials in the market. in this context, this paper presents the results of a research project in the design stage of an energy efficient three phase squirrel cage induction motor (scim), by investigating the effects of several soft magnetic materials (adopted for its stator and/or its rotor parts) on multiple quantities of primary concern such as: efficiency, power factor, output torque, losses, weight and cost. after a brief proposed design procedure, a total of twenty-two different materials from recent manufacturers' data were examined. also, the main electromagnetic analysis was performed through commercial analysis software. simple ranking methods are also proposed here for different application areas and the results obtained are then thoroughly discussed and commented.
computer-aided_design	simulated spectrometric observations of unresolved resident space objects are required for the interpretation of quantities measured by optical telescopes. this allows for their characterization as part of regular space surveillance activity. a peer-reviewed spacecraft reflectance model is necessary to help improve the understanding of characterization measurements. with this objective in mind, a novel approach to model spacecraft spectral reflectance as an overall spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (sbrdf) is presented. a spacecraft 's overall sbrdf is determined using its triangular-faceted computer-aided design (cad) model and the empirical sbrdf of its homogeneous materials. the cad model is used to determine the proportional contribution of each homogeneous material to the overall reflectance. each empirical sbrdf is contained in look-up tables developed from measurements made over a range of illumination and reflection geometries using simple interpolation and extrapolation techniques. a demonstration of the spacecraft reflectance model is provided through simulation of an optical ground truth characterization using the canadian advanced nanospace experiment-1 engineering model nanosatellite as the subject. validation of the reflectance model is achieved through a qualitative comparison of simulated and measured quantities.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background & aims: mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs) mediate tissue repair and might be used to prevent or reduce liver fibrosis. however, little is known about the anti-fibrotic factors secreted from mscs or their mechanisms. methods: umbilical cord-derived mscs ( ucmscs) were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells ( hpucmscs), medium was collected, and secretome proteins were identified and quantified using nanochip-liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. liver fibrosis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of thioacetamide or ccl4; some mice were then given injections of secretomes or proteins. liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology or polymerase chain reaction array to analyze changes in gene expression patterns. we analyzed the effects of msc secretomes and potential anti-fibrotic proteins on transforming growth factor beta 1 ( tgf beta 1)-mediated activation of human hepatic stellate cell ( hsc) lines ( htert-hsc and lx2) and human primary hscs. liver tissues were collected from 16 patients with liver cirrhosis and 16 individuals without cirrhosis ( controls) in korea and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblots. results: in mice with fibrosis, accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins was significantly reduced 3 days after injecting secretomes from ucmscs, and to a greater extent from hpucmscs; numbers of activated hscs that expressed the myogenic marker a-smooth muscle actin ( alpha-sma, encoded by acta2 [ actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle]) were also reduced. secretomes from ucmscs, and to a greater extent from hpucmscs, reduced liver expression of multiple fibrotic factors, collagens, metalloproteinases, tgf beta, and smad proteins in the tgfb signaling pathways. in hsc cell lines and primary hscs, tgf beta 1-stimulated upregulation of alpha-sma was significantly inhibited ( and smad2 phosphorylation reduced) by secretomes from ucmscs, and to a greater extent from hpucmscs. we identified 32 proteins in secretomes of ucmscs that were more highly concentrated in secretomes from hpucmscs and inhibited tgf beta-mediated activation of hscs. one of these, milk fat globule-egf factor 8 ( mfge8), was a strong inhibitor of activation of human primary hscs. we found mfge8 to downregulate expression of tgfb type i receptor by binding to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin on hscs and to be secreted by mscs from umbilical cord, teeth, and bone marrow. in mice, injection of recombinant human mfge8 had anti-fibrotic effects comparable to those of the hpucmsc secretome, reducing extracellular matrix deposition and hsc activation. co-injection of an antibody against mfge8 reduced the anti-fibrotic effects of the hpucmsc secretome in mice. levels of mfge8 were reduced in cirrhotic liver tissue from patients compared with controls. conclusions: mfge8 is an anti-fibrotic protein in msc secretomes that strongly inhibits tgf beta signaling and reduces extracellular matrix deposition and liver fibrosis in mice.
computer-aided_design	the use of virtual surgery, patient-specific saw and drill guides, and custom-made osteosynthesis plates is rapidly spreading from deformity surgery to orthognathic surgery. most of the commercially available systems are using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (cad/cam) wafers to produce patient-specific saw guides. however, most plate systems provided are still the conventional ""in stock"" mini plates that can be individually designed by pre-bending according to the stereolithographic model of the patient. custom made three-dimensional (3d) printed implants have earlier been demonstrated to be an ideal solution in deformity surgery and in reconstruction of complex posttraumatic cases. in this study, we report the novel use of patient-specific saw and drill guides combined with patient-specific 3d titanium alloy implants as a fixation system in maxillary movement after le fort i and bimaxillary osteotomies (n = 32). the implants were individually designed for each patient to follow anatomical structures and to provide exact positioning and stability of the repositioned maxilla.

molecular_biology	5-bromouracil is a nucleobase analogue that can replace thymine in dna strands and acts as a strong radiosensitizer, with potential applications in molecular biology and cancer therapy. here, the deactivation of 5-bromouracil after ultraviolet irradiation is investigated in the singlet and triplet manifold by accurate quantum chemistry calculations and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. it is found that, after irradiation to the bright pp* state, three main relaxation pathways are, in principle, possible: relaxation back to the ground state, intersystem crossing (isc) and c-br photodissociation. based on accurate ms-caspt2 optimizations, we propose that ground-state relaxation should be the predominant deactivation pathway in the gas phase. we then employ different electronic structure methods to assess their suitability to carry out excited-state dynamics simulations. mrcis (multi-reference configuration interaction including single excitations) was used in surface hopping simulations to compute the ultrafast isc dynamics, which mostly involves the (1)n(o)pi* and (3)pi pi* states. this article is part of the themed issue 'theoretical and computational studies of non-equilibrium and non-statistical dynamics in the gas phase, in the condensed phase and at interfaces'.

molecular_biology	background: in many parts of the old world, domesticated camels (genus - camelus) are an essential resource, providing food, labor, commodities, and sport to millions of people of the three extent species, two have been domesticated (single-humped dromedarius, camelus dromedarius, and two humped bactrian camels camelus bactrianus) and one remains wild (two-humped wild bactrian camels camelus ferus). all three species possess a variety adaptations to harsh desert conditions, including mechanisms to tolerate of extreme temperatures, dehydration, and sandy terrain. people residing in harsh climate zones of the world are being benefitted by raising camels in terms of draft, milk, meat, hides and wool from centuries. there are different breeds of dromedary camels distributed in various parts of pakistan; however there have been scarcity of research work on camels in pakistan. identification of novel link between camel breeders with fatal neurodegenerative disorders is presence or not can be detect by a prion gene and it was not carried out in pakistan soil to date. prion diseases which are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affect both animals and humans. it is believed that the prions are infectious agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. in this study we report the first study on prion protein gene in dromedary camels of pakistan. material, methods & results: genes are the blueprint of life and determine the functional aspects of cellular mechanisms. genomic dna of the enrolled blood samples was extracted using the nucleospin((r)) dna extraction kit. genomic dna was run on agarose gel electrophoresis, checked the genomic dna quality and amplified using prion region specific primer pair. prion protein gene was amplified (770 bp) in 35 individuals of seven dromedary camel breeds from the province balochistan and punjab of pakistan. samples having required fragment size were selected and sent for sequencing through sanger sequencing. all the sequences were aligned through multiple sequence alignment and edited using codon code aligner and explored for phylogenetic analysis. a portion of 667 bp was finally selected for phylogenetic analysis of dromedary camels from pakistan with 61 different mammalian species (drawn from genbank) that revealed five different clades. we found 99.9% nucleotide sequence similarities among dromedary camels (germany), dromedary camels (iran), and dromedary camels (pakistan). we observed deletion in dromedary camels in codon region 66-69 except wild bactrian camels that might be the causative factor for prion protein gene resistance in camels. the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates was used to draw phylogenetic tree. discussion: this study documents the presence of 14 prp polymorphisms and shows the relationship between different camel breeds. the deletion had not previously been examined prp allelic variation, and was found to segregate in these breeds. however, additional data are necessary to demonstrate prp and genetic approach will be ideal for the future studies and, more investigations are necessary to demonstrate prp genetic resistance in camels. the utility of these techniques in identifying prion genes and selecting superior animals and culling the weak animals and making them parents of the next generation that will lead to producing more meat and milk with fewer animals are well discussed and by slaughtering of high prion incidence will eliminate human animal fatal neurodegenerative disorders.
materials_engineering	modelling and simulation of multiphysical phenomena need to be considered in the design and optimisation of mechanical properties of cast components in order to accelerate the introduction of new cast alloys. the data on casting defects, including microstructure features, are crucial for evaluating the final performance-related properties of the component. in this paper, the required models for the prediction of interdendritic casting defects, such as microporosity and hot tears, are reviewed. the data on calculated solidification shrinkage are presented and its effects on microporosity levels discussed. numerical simulation results for microporosity are presented for a356, 356 and 319 aluminium alloys using procast software. the calculated pressure drop of the interdendritic liquid was observed to be quite significant and the regions of high-pressure drop can be used as an indicator on the severity of interdendritic microporosity defects.
computer-aided_design	introduction: the surgical template is a guide aimed at directing the implant placement, tumor resection, osteotomy and bone repositioning. using it, preoperative planning can be transferred to the actual surgical site, and the precision, safety and reliability of the surgery can be improved. however, the actual workflow of the surgical template design and manufacturing is quite complicated before the final clinical application.areas covered: the major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source of the current and future development of the template design and manufacturing for relevant researchers.expert commentary: this paper aims to present a review of the necessary procedures in the template-guided surgery including the image processing, 3d visualization, preoperative planning, surgical guide design and manufacturing. in addition, the template-guided clinical applications for various kinds of surgeries are reviewed, and it demonstrated that the precision of the surgery has been improved compared with the non-guided operations.
immunology	background: patients who have failed traditional treatment of chronic urticaria may require trials of alternative medications. safety profiles, continuous laboratory monitoring, and physician comfort are often barriers to treatment. objectives: to evaluate the safety of alternative agents used in chronic urticaria. methods: a retrospective chart review of electronic medical records from a single-center allergy and immunology clinic in a major academic hospital was conducted. one hundred twenty-six charts of patients with chronic urticaria treated with alternative agents were reviewed. results: adverse effects were reported in 39 of 73 (53%) patients on dapsone, 19 of 47 (40%) patients on sulfasalazine, 15 of 36 (42%) patients on tacrolimus, 7 of 45 (16%) patients on hydroxychloroquine, 9 of 27 (33%) patients on mycophenolate, 6 of 8 (75%) patients on cyclosporine, and 3 of 24 (4%) patients on omalizumab. most of these adverse effects were mild, did not require discontinuation of the medication, and resolved after stopping the medication or decreasing the dose. conclusions: the use of alternative agents for the treatment of chronic urticaria angioedema is generally safe when proper laboratory and clinical monitoring is observed.

human_metabolism	occurring alongside the main saccharide components, antioxidant compounds in honey play significant roles in human metabolism and nutrition. six individual organic acids and two saccharides were determined by a simple and rapid capillary electrophoretic technique without any special treatment. gluconic acid was the predominant organic acid and was detected in all samples. formic, malic, citric and succinic acids were determined at minor concentrations, while oxalic acid was not detected in any of the samples. glucose and fructose content was found between 223.50 g.kg(-1) and 422.40 g.kg(-1), and 310.20 g.kg(-1) and 642.20 g.kg(-1), respectively. the fructose/glucose ratios of the ten honey samples in this study were between 1.18 and 1.75 with an average value of 1.50. gluconic acid content changed depending on the type of honey between 1.50 g.kg(-1) and 13.8 g.kg(-1) with an average value of 6.24 g.kg(-1), while the other organic acids were at minor concentrations, or were not detected at all. the antioxidant properties of the honey were analysed in terms of total polyphenols, ferric-reducing/antioxidant power (frap) and 1,1-dipheny1-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) scavenging activities. among the samples, darker honeys showed higher antioxidant values, related to their total phenolic compound contents.
enzymology	introduction: enzymes are the macromolecular catalysts of many living processes and represent a sizable proportion of all druggable biological targets. enzymology has been practiced just over a century during which much progress has been made in both the identification of new enzymes and the development of novel methodologies for enzyme kinetics. areas covered: this review aims to address several key practical aspects in enzyme kinetics in reference to translational drug discovery research. the authors first define what constitutes a high performance enzyme kinetic assay. the authors then review the best practices for turnover, activation and inhibition kinetics to derive critical parameters guiding drug discovery. notably, the authors recommend global progress curve analysis of dose/time dependence employing an integrated michaelis-menten equation and global curve fitting of dose/dose dependence. expert opinion: the authors believe that in vivo enzyme and substrate abundance and their dynamics, binding modality, drug binding kinetics and enzyme 's position in metabolic networks should be assessed to gauge the translational impact on drug efficacy and safety. integrating these factors in a systems biology and systems pharmacology model should facilitate translational drug discovery.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background and objectivebacteria in the dental biofilm surrounding marginal gingival grooves cause periodontal diseases. numerous bacteria within the biofilm consume nutrients from the gingival crevicular fluid. furthermore, some gram-negative bacteria in mature dental biofilms produce butyrate. thus, gingival epithelial cells in close proximity to mature dental biofilms are at risk of both starvation and exposure to butyrate. in the present study, we determined the combined effects of starvation and butyrate exposure on gingival epithelial cell death and the underlying mechanisms. material and methodsthe ca9-22 cell line was used as an in vitro counterpart of gingival epithelial cells. cell death was measured as the amount of total dna in the dead cells using sytox green dye, which penetrates through membranes of dead cells and emits fluorescence when it intercalates into double-stranded dna. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) activity, the amount of autophagy, and acetylation of histone h3 were determined using western blot. gene expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3b (lc3b) were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. resultsbutyrate-induced cell death occurred in a dose-dependent manner whether cells were starved or fed. however, the induction of cell death was two to four times higher when cells were placed under starvation conditions compared to when they were fed. moreover, both starvation and butyrate exposure induced ampk activity and autophagy. while ampk inactivation resulted in decreased autophagy and butyrate-induced cell death under conditions of starvation, ampk activation resulted in butyrate-induced cell death when cells were fed. combined with the results of our previous report, which demonstrated butyrate-induced autophagy-dependent cell death, the results of this study suggest that the combination of starvation and butyrate exposure activates ampk inducing autophagy and subsequent cell death. notably, this combination markedly induced lc3b production and the induction was attenuated by ampk inhibition. lc3b knockdown, in turn, significantly decreased butyrate-induced cell death. therefore, ampk-dependent lc3b induction apparently plays an important role in butyrate-induced cell death. there was a lack of correspondence between the levels of ampk activation and lc3b induction; this may reflect the histone deacetylase-inhibitory capacity of butyrate on histone proteins. conclusiontaken together, starvation and butyrate exposure promote autophagy via ampk signaling, while the histone deacetylase-inhibitory effects of butyrate alter chromatin to transcriptionally active state, resulting in strong lc3b induction and subsequent cell death. these findings may help improve the understanding of the cellular processes underlying periodontal disease initiation.
manufacturing_engineering	omitted citations - i.e., missing links between a cited paper and the corresponding citing papers - are the main consequence of several bibliometric database errors. this paper investigates the possible relationship between omitted citations and publishers of the relevant citing papers. this relationship is potentially meaningful because: (i) publishers generally impose editorial styles, which could affect database errors, and (ii) some publishers may be more efficient than others in detecting and correcting pre-existing errors in the manuscripts to be published, reducing the risk of database errors. based on an extensive sample of scientific papers in the manufacturing engineering field, this study examines the citations omitted by the scopus and wos databases, using a recent automated algorithm. major results are that: (i) there are significant differences in terms of omitted-citation rate between publishers and (ii) the omitted-citation rates of publishers may vary depending on the database in use.

hydraulics	a herringbone water-sediment separation structure (hereinafter referred to as ""herringbone structure"") has been shown to be effective in separating coarse inorganic debris; however, less is known regarding the large wood (lw) filtration effect in this structure. this paper presents preliminary research on the wood filtration effect of the herringbone structure based on physical model tests. the results show that the herringbone structure exhibited effective performance in large wood size segregation, with a 100% component filtration rate for lw that diameter (d) larger than ribbed beam opening width (a). the total filtration rate also exceeded 80% when the fraud number (fr) is larger than 2.64 and increased with the increase of fr. after exceeding fr (max), total filtration rate would be decreased due to overflow. beside flow condition, structure parameters influence significantly on lw filtration rate. we attempt to explain the filtration process via particle contact trajectory and particle movement trajectory. the inclined angle of ribbed beam (gamma) contributed the most variation to the filtration rate via influencing the coincidence with particle contact trajectory and particle movement trajectory. the high sensitivity coefficient of ribbed beam (theta) under relatively low fr conditions implies remarkable influences on lw filtration effects by causing clogging problem. the ribbed beam opening width (a) together with lw diameter (d) influenced the size segregation performance.
thermodynamics	environmental applications of graphene (gn) are limited by the occurrence of aggregation. herein, graphene oxide (go) was synthesized, reduced to gn by ascorbic acid, and intercalated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab). gn-ctab was characterized by boehm 's titration, n-2 adsorption/desorption, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectrophotometry, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. then, gn-ctab was used for the adsorptive removal of acid red 265 (ar265) and acid orange 7 (ao7) dyes from water both under batch and column operation. under batch operation, the effect of ph, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, contact time and temperature on dyes adsorption were assessed. adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics were analyzed systematically. regarding the fixed bed operation, the effect of both the bed height and flow rate were studied and experimental results fitted to the thomas and bdst models. then, the bed loss capacity along five adsorption-regeneration cycles was determined in order to further approach the practical application of gn-ctab for wastewater treatment, namely for the removal of dyes.

computer-aided_design	background: recent introduction of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) monolithic zirconia dental prostheses raises the issue of material low thermal degradation (ltd), a wellknown problem with zirconia hip prostheses. this phenomenon could be accentuated by masticatory mechanical stress. until now zirconia ltd process has only been studied in vitro. this work introduces an original protocol to evaluate ltd process of monolithic zirconia prostheses in the oral environment and to study their general clinical behavior, notably in terms of wear. methods/design: 101 posterior monolithic zirconia tooth elements (molars and premolars) are included in a 5-year prospective clinical trial. on each element, several areas between 1 and 2 mm(2) (6 on molars, 4 on premolars) are determined on restoration surface: areas submitted or non-submitted to mastication mechanical stress, glazed or non-glazed. before prosthesis placement, ex vivo analyses regarding ltd and wear are performed using raman spectroscopy, sem imagery and 3d laser profilometry. after placement, restorations are clinically evaluated following criteria of the world dental federation (fdi), complemented by the analysis of fracture clinical risk factors. two independent examiners perform the evaluations. clinical evaluation and ex vivo analyses are carried out after 6 months and then each year for up to 5 years. discussion: for clinicians and patients, the results of this trial will justify the use of monolithic zirconia restorations in dental practice. for researchers, the originality of a clinical study including ex vivo analyses of material aging will provide important data regarding zirconia properties.

southern_blotting	two promoter probe plasmid vectors, designated pipp1 and pipp2, were constructed from the existing plasmids pxe4 and pset152. pipp1 and 2 use the xyle gene of pseudomonas putida as a reporter and can be transferred to streptomycetes by conjugation from escherichia coli. the function of these plasmids as promoter probes was demonstrated in streptomyces antibioticus and streptomyces coelicolor using the phenoxazinone synthase and polynucleotide phosphorylase promoters from s. antibioticus. xyle activity could be detected in colonies on agar plates or via the in vitro assay for catechol dioxygenase. the integration into the s. antibioticus chromosome of the constructs containing the phsa promoter was verified by southern blotting. the presence of the bla locus in pipp1 allows the recovery of putative promoters by marker rescue.

southern_blotting	the marine photosynthetic bacterium rhodovulum sulfidophilum produces extracellular nucleic acids involved in its flocculation. previously, we showed that the rna fraction of these extracellular nucleic acids released into the culture medium contains mainly non-aminoacylated fully mature-sized trnas and fragments of 16s and 23s rrnas. here, we report the characterization of extracellular dna itself and its production during cultivation. no differences were detected in nucleotide sequence between the intracellular dna and extracellular soluble dna on southern blotting. whole intracellular dna seemed to be released from the cell. the bacterial floc was degraded by deoxyribonuclease or ribonuclease treatment, indicating that at least the extracellular dna and rnas in the floc are involved in the maintenance of the floc. when cultivated in nutritionally rich medium, the bacteria formed small flocs and produced large amounts of extracellular dna, which were solubilized in the medium. in nutritionally poor medium, however, huge flocs of cells appeared and almost no extracellular soluble dna was observed in the medium. as the floc was degraded by deoxyribonuclease treatment, it seems likely that the extracellular soluble dna observed in the rich medium may be incorporated into the large floc and play a role in floc maintenance in poor medium. addition of an inhibitor of quorum sensing, alpha-cyclodextrin, inhibited huge floc maintenance in the nutritionally poor medium. in the presence of alpha-cyclodextrin, the floc was rapidly degraded and extracellular soluble dna production increased.
northern_blotting	background/aims: the organization of actin cytoskeleton in podocyte foot processes plays a critical role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. the camp pathway is an important regulator of the actin network assembly in cells. however, the role of the camp pathway in podocytes is not well understood. type 1 adenylate cyclase (adcy1), previously thought to be specific for neuronal tissue, is a member of the family of enzymes that catalyses the formation of camp. in this study, we characterized the expression and role of adcy1 in the kidney. methods: expression of adcy1 was studied by rt-pcr, northern blotting and in situ hybridization. the role of adcy1 in podocytes was investigated by analyzing adcy1 knockout mice (adcy1-/-). results and conclusion: adcy1 is expressed in the kidney specifically by podocytes. in the kidney, adcy1 does not have a critical role in normal physiological functioning as kidney histology and function are normal in adcy1-/-mice. however, albumin overload resulted in severe albuminuria in adcy1-/-mice, whereas wild-type control mice showed only mild albumin leakage to urine. in conclusion, we have identified adcy1 as a novel podocyte signaling protein that seems to have a role in compensatory physiological processes in the glomerulus. copyright (c) 2010 s. karger ag, basel
machine_design	the goal of this study is to address preliminary design and prototyping of a novel 5-phase segment-type switched reluctance motor (seg-srm) with 10/8 pole configuration. the proposed seg-srm includes a stator having salient poles and a rotor having segmental steel cores which are embedded in aluminum block. the operation of seg-srm depends on exciting two adjacent phases respectively at all times by creating mutual coupling, thus leading less eddy current effects on silicon steel sheets of the stator and better efficiency. a quick design methodology covering all geometrical details of segsrm is given. this comprehensive method is useful for initial machine design and eliminates the machines with undesired outputs. besides, the performance characteristics of the designed seg-srm are investigated by finite element method (fem). finally, a prototype is manufactured and tested in the laboratory based on computed analytical parameters and the operational outcomes of the developed system are presented by verifying finite element studies. it is completely substantiated that this new preliminary design can be used in applications ranging from low speed to medium speed. the comparative study among simulation and experimental studies seeks to address torque production/prediction versus current variation.
machine_design	in this contribution we develop and describe a new, adaptive, pulsed-laser welding method for thin electrical laminations. by using a reflective laser sensor and a custom-made control unit with the appropriate software the system triggers the laser pulse only at the contacts between the laminations. in this way the total laser pulse energy and, consequently, the specific power losses of the electromotor, where the stack is used, are significantly reduced. this new method has great potential in the serial production of electromotors.

enzymology	hybridization between divergent species can be analyzed to elucidate expression patterns of distinct parental characteristics, as well as to provide information about the extent of reproductive isolation between species. a known hybrid cross between two rattlesnakes with highly divergent venom phenotypes provided the opportunity to examine occurrence of parental venom characteristics in the f-1 hybrids as well as ontogenetic shifts in the expression of these characters as the hybrids aged. although venom phenotypes of adult rattlesnake venoms are known for many species, the effect of hybridization on phenotype inheritance is not well understood, and effects of hybridization on venom ontogeny have not yet been investigated. the current study investigates both phenomena resulting from the hybridization of a male snake with type i degradative venom, crotalus oreganus helleri (southern pacific rattlesnake), and a female snake with type ii highly toxic venom, crotalus scutulatus scutulatus (mojave rattlesnake). sds-page, enzymology, western blot and reversed phase hplc (rp-hplc) were used to characterize the venom of the c. o. helleri male, the c. s. scutulatus female and their two hybrid offspring as they aged. in general, crotalus o. helleri x c s. scutulatus hybrid venoms appeared to exhibit overlapping parental venom profiles, and several different enzyme activity patterns. both hybrids expressed c. o. helleri father-specific myotoxins as well as c. s. scutulatus mother -specific mojave toxin. snake venom metalloprotease activity displayed apparent sex -influenced expression patterns, while hybrid serine protease activities were intermediate to parental activities. the c. s. scutulatus x c. o. helleri hybrid male 's venom profile provided the strongest evidence that type i and type ii venom characteristics are expressed simultaneously in hybrid venoms, as this snake contained distinctive characteristics of both parental species. however, the possibility of sex -influenced development of metalloprotease activity, as seen in the ontogenetic shifts of the hybrid female, may influence the levels of expression of both type i and type ii characteristics in hybrid venoms. ultimately, the chronological analysis of this known hybrid system reveals the most distinct characteristics that can be used in determining successful hybridization between snakes that follow the type i-type ii trend in rattlesnake venom composition, namely the presence of metalloprotease activity and mojave toxin.

hydraulics	biofilm acts stabilising river-bed sediments, interfering with particle entrainment and, consequently, preventing bed disturbance. in this paper we present the results of a series of experiments carried out in indoor channels, aimed to understand biofilm alteration of bed material motion and topographic changes in stream channels. we analysed the erosion patterns and bedload rates in non-cohesive sediments in channels colonised by biofilms and compared them to biofilm-free others. all the channels had the same conditions of light irradiance, temperature, slope, and particle size (sand). discharge and water surface slope were modified to create a range of hydraulic conditions, with pairs of colonised and non-colonised channels subjected to the same flows. we observed that biofilm slightly modified bed roughness and flow hydraulics, but that highly influenced bed disturbance. biofilm caused bed scour to occur in patches unevenly distributed along the channel length, as a result of localised weaknesses of the biofilm. once biofilm was ripped up it was transported in chunks, and sand grains were observed attached to these chunks. in non-colonised sediments the erosion was more homogeneous and the formation and movement of bedforms were observed. on average, bedload rates were 5 times lower when biofilm was present. overall, the protective effect of the biofilm prevented generalised erosion of the channel and delayed the entrainment and transport of sand grains. results emphasised the important role of biofilm in the incipient motion of bed-material in stream channels; this role may affect the magnitude and frequency of subsequent river bed processes, notably the onset of bedload and associated channel morpho-dynamics.

manufacturing_engineering	a planar serial manipulator is well suited for industrial applications in aided automation manufacturing, engineering applications for space robots, excavators, and pump trucks as well as medical applications for orthopaedic surgery robotics and micro-holder for tactile sending fingers. this study presents a detailed discussion on the classification, joint angle ranges and solution space atlases for analysis and design of the planar serial manipulators. the planar manipulators are categorized into three classes with further several sub-classes based on link lengths in terms of joint angle ranges. furthermore, an improved bounded solution space is proposed to display global performances of the manipulators that leads to a design with global optimization. besides, the joint angle ranges of the manipulator are displayed over the characteristics charts in no relation to the assembly orders of the manipulator links. finally, case studies illustrate the presented idea.

human_metabolism	in healthy subjects some tissues in the human body display metabolic flexibility, by this we mean the ability for the tissue to switch its fuel source between predominantly carbohydrates in the postprandial state and predominantly fats in the fasted state. many of the pathways involved with human metabolism are controlled by insulin and insulin-resistant states such as obesity and type-2 diabetes are characterised by a loss or impairment of metabolic flexibility. in this paper we derive a system of 12 first-order coupled differential equations that describe the transport between and storage in different tissues of the human body. we find steady state solutions to these equations and use these results to nondimensionalise the model. we then solve the model numerically to simulate a healthy balanced meal and a high fat meal and we discuss and compare these results. our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data where we have data available to us and the results show behaviour that agrees with intuition where we currently have no data with which to compare.
internal_combustion_engine	minimization of parasitic losses in the internal combustion (ic) engine is essential for improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. surface texturing has emerged as a method palliating these losses in instances where thin lubricant films lead to mixed or boundary regimes of lubrication. such thin films are prevalent in contact of compression ring to cylinder liner at piston motion reversals because of momentary cessation of entraining motion. the paper provides combined solution of reynolds equation, boundary interactions, and a gas flow model to predict the tribological conditions, particularly at piston reversals. this model is then validated against measurements using a floating liner for determination of in situ friction of an engine under motored condition. very good agreement is obtained. the validated model is then used to ascertain the effect of surface texturing of the liner surface during reversals. therefore, the paper is a combined study of numerical predictions and the effect of surface texturing. the predictions show that some marginal gains in engine performance can be expected with laser textured chevron features of shallow depth under certain operating conditions.
manufacturing_engineering	the oregon institute of technology (oit), portland center, has been offering manufacturing engineering technology (mfget) and mechanical engineering technology (met) undergraduate programs for students around the greater portland metropolitan area for the past ten (10) years. a master 's degree in manufacturing engineering technology (mmfget) is also offered. these programs are extensions of programs offered at oit main campus in klamath falls. portland campus programs are designed specifically to cater to students employed full-time in industry. this paper discusses engineering technology programs and their direct application in training local company full-time employees to become engineers and managers. most of these employees have associate degrees and years of experience in their respective companies. a discussion of engineering-related, hands-on work experience and understanding of engineering principles and their applications presented. the effectiveness of special instruction techniques, custom-developed for students with limited time availability, while maintaining abet accreditations is also discussed. discussion-oriented learning and teaching models and the impact of adding dimensions to these instructional models, with the industry-experienced students in mind, is emphasized. case studies are presented to show improvement in student engagement, curiosity, and application of new knowledge to actual day-to-day, work-environment problems. advantages and disadvantages of night school are discussed.
human_metabolism	nutrition research is in the process of addressing a series of questions related to the future of diet and health. are all humans the same with respect to their response to diet? if not, humans must be fed differently according to the differences in their genetics and metabolic needs. are those differences self-evident to the individual or their care-givers? if not, methods must be developed to measure the basis of differences between humans. are the current sets of diagnostic biomarkers for disease appropriate and sufficient to distinguish the appropriate diets of humans for optimal metabolic health? if not, metabolites must be measured such that the differences in human metabolism are resolvable before they become diseased. will a small subset of metabolic markers provide an indication of intended and unintended effects of diets that relate to overall metabolism? if not, comprehensive metabolic analyses (metabolomics) must be put in place to ensure that all aspects of health are accurately assessed. inappropriate dietary choices are accelerating the development of chronic metabolic disease and threatening to overwhelm public health 's ability to manage them. nutrition and food sciences will need to collaborate with other scientific disciplines to develop and implement metabolic assessment technologies and to assemble annotated databases of metabolite profiles in humans, thus building the knowledge needed to link metabolism to diet and health. biochemical and physiological research must be guided to define the mechanisms by which diet interacts with metabolism in different individuals. integrating metabolism with the genetic and dietary variables that affect health is the role of nutrition sciences. integrating personal nutritional value with food 's other key values of safety, quality, comfort, delight, convenience and affordability is the role of food science. it is time for these two fields to address a common problem, metabolic health, with coordinated solutions.
molecular_biology	plant virus ecology mainly focuses upon populations and their interactions with host plants within environment. the subject includes interesting insights as many factors which affect the virus behavior, population, virus-vector interactions, biodiversity and host plants genotypes are involved in it. moreover the achievements in the field of molecular ecology by application of recent molecular biology techniques are included which enhance the strength in understanding the economically important virus populations, growth and their world wide spread. virus infection results direct and indirect effect on insect vectors by evolution of changes in their life cycles, health and interacting behaviors that support their spread. similarly, the description of the recent information about how plant viruses disseminate towards the important agro-ecological zones in naturally managed vegetations and which factors play important role in ecological aspects are also included in this review. the modern era of science and technology requires a better understanding about movement of viruses in both directions which has become a highly important issue to levitate such kinds of aspects thus making plant virus ecology an exciting research discipline in future.
northern_blotting	background and aim: the tumor-suppressing role of ras-association domain family 1a (rassf1a) has been described in several systems. in this study, we tested its tumor-suppressing ability and the potential molecular mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) from qidong county. methods: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting were employed to detect the expression of rassf1a in hcc. after establishing stable rassf1a (wild type or mutant) expressing 'qi dong gan ai yan jiu suo' ([qidong institute of liver cancer] qgy)-7703 cell lines, we tested the effects of rassf1a expression on cell growth by cell proliferation rate, cell colony formation, and cell cycle progression. we also tested the effects of rassf1a expression on tumorigenesis in nude mice and on cellular sensitivity to mitomycin treatment. results: the rassf1a transcript was not found in 75% (three of four) of hcc cell lines and 67% (32/48) of hcc primary biopsies. the stepwise regression analyses indicated that the loss of rassf1a expression was more frequent in patients who were hepatitis b virus surface antigen positive (hbsag+) compared to those who were hbsag(-), both in tumor and corresponding non-cancerous tissues. the wild-type (wt)-rassf1a expression in the qgy-7703 cell line resulted in fewer and smaller clones, decreased xenograft tumor volume and weight, and g(1)/s arrest in vitro and in vivo. the wt-rassf1a expression also decreased the cyclin d1 protein expression, which appeared to be at the level of post-transcriptional control. in addition, the wt-rassf1a expression increased cell growth inhibition and the percentage of cells with sub-g(1) dna content when the cells were treated with mitomycin. conclusion: rassf1a is a tumor suppressor in hcc. the loss of rassf1a expression may be related to hbsag+ in hepatocarcinogenesis. its inactivation may play an important role in the development of hcc.
strength_of_materials	we proposed an equation formulating the relationship between the resonant frequency of a quartz crystal and the mass loading. the equation developed by sauerbrey concerning quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) was improved by a new approach based on the mechanical strength of materials. this equation is seemingly trivial but greatly improves the accuracy with respect to the frequency-mass relationship to frequency shifts of 10% or more in the case of selected materials. methods to treat the effects of crystal mounting and non-uniformity of deposited films are elucidated.
fluid_mechanics	swimming performance of spermatozoa is an important index for the success of fertilization. for many years, numerous studies have reported the optimal swimming of flagellar organisms. nevertheless, there is still a question as to which is optimal among planar, circular helical and ellipsoidal helical beating. in this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to investigate the beat pattern with the best swimming efficiency based on hydrodynamic dissipation and internal torque exertion. for the parameters considered, our results show that the planar beat is optimal for small heads and the helical flagellum is optimum for a larger heads, while the ellipsoidal beat is never optimal. also, the genetic optimization reveals that the wavenumber and shape of wave envelope are relevant parameters, whereas the wave shape and head geometry have relatively minor effects on efficiency. the optimal beat with respect to the efficiency based on the internal torque exertion of an active elastic flagellum is characterized by a small-wave number and large-amplitude wave in a lower-viscosity medium. the obtained results on the optimal waveform are consistent with observations for planar waveforms, but in many respects, the results suggest the necessity of a detailed flagellar structure-fluid interaction to address whether real spermatozoa exhibit hydrodynamically efficient swimming. the evolutional optimization approach used in this study has distinguished biologically important parameters, and the methodology can potentially be applicable to various swimmers.

hydraulics	one way to study ecological implications induced by hydropeaking represents the coupling of hydrodynamic models with habitat suitability models, in which hydrodynamic parameters are typically used to describe the physical habitat of indicator species. this article discusses the differences in habitat suitability assessment between 2d and 3d cfd modelling as input for the habitat simulation tool casimir. in the first part of the article, the accuracy of the hydraulic model is evaluated by comparing the model results with laboratory (model of a laboratory channel with erodible bed) and field measurements (valsura river, bolzano, italy). in the second part, the habitat suitability for the valsura river case study (affected by hydropeaking), is analyzed comparing different approaches for the reconstruction of the velocity field (depth-averaged velocities from 2d modelling, bottom velocity field reconstruction with log-law approach from 2d modelling and bottom velocity field from 3d modelling). the results show that the habitat suitability index (hsi) using 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models can be significantly different. these differences can be ascribed to a higher capability to depict the features of the flow field with highly variable and heterogeneous boundary conditions and to the possibility to simulate the near bed hydrodynamic parameters, which are relevant for certain target species. in particular, the hsi-values using 3d hydraulics lead to larger areas of highly suitable habitats compared to 2d simulations. moreover, considering the entire flow range of hydropeaking events, the habitat simulations with bottom flow velocities from 3d modelling provide suitable habitats over the entire flow range representing the availability of stable suitable habitats, while the habitat availability of 2d modelled flow velocity is continuously decreasing with increasing flow rates.

polymerase_chain_reaction	we explored the expression and function of mir-181d (microrna-181d) in human pancreatic cancer. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to probe mir-181d expression in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and human pancreatic carcinoma. pancreatic cancer cell lines, panc-1 and aspc-1 cells, were engineered to stably downregulate endogenous mir-181d through lentiviral transduction. the mechanistic effects of mir-181d downregulation on pancreatic cancer development were tested by proliferation, migration, fluorouracil chemosensitivity assays in vitro, and explant assay in vivo. possible mir-181d downstream gene, nkain2 (na+/k+ transporting atpase interacting 2), was tested by dual-luciferase activity assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. functional involvement of nkain2 in mir-181d-regulated pancreatic cancer development was tested by small interfering rna-mediated nkain2 knockdown in mir-181d-downregulated panc-1 and aspc-1 cells. mir-181d was upregulated in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and human pancreatic carcinoma. lentivirus-induced mir-181d downregulation decreased pancreatic cancer proliferation, migration, and fluorouracil resistance in vitro and inhibited the growth of cancer explant in vivo. nkain2 was directly targeted by mir-181d in pancreatic cancer. small interfering rna-mediated nkain2 knockdown reversed the inhibition of mir-181d downregulation on pancreatic cancer development. mir-181d is aberrantly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. inhibiting mir-181d may suppress pancreatic cancer development, possibly through the inverse regulation on nkain2.
cell_biology	tcl/rhoj is a cdc42-related rho gtpase with reported activities in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis, metastatic melanoma, and corneal epithelial cells; however, less is known about how it is inherently regulated in comparison to its closest homologues tc10 and cdc42. tcl has an n-terminal extension of 18 amino acids in comparison to cdc42, but the function of this amino acid sequence has not been elucidated. a truncation mutant lacking the n terminus (n) was found to alter tcl plasma membrane localization and nucleotide binding, and additional truncation and point mutants mapped the alterations of tcl biochemistry to amino acids 17-20. interestingly, whereas the tcl n mutant clearly influenced nucleotide exchange, deletion of the n terminus from its closest homologue, tc10, did not have a similar effect. chimeras of tcl and tc10 revealed amino acids 121-129 of tcl contributed to the differences in nucleotide loading. together, these results identify amino acids within the n terminus and a loop region distal to the nucleotide binding pocket of tcl capable of allosterically regulating nucleotide exchange and thus influence membrane association of the protein.
human_metabolism	blue mussels (mytilus edulis) accumulate and biotransform arsenic (as) to a larger variety of arsenicals than most seafood. eight volunteers ingested a test meal consisting of 150 g blue mussel (680) mu g as), followed by 72 h with an identical, low as controlled diet and full urine sampling. we provide a complete speciation, with individual patterns, of urinary as excretion. total as (tas) urinary excretion was 328 +/- 47 mu g, whereof arsenobetaine (ab) and dimethylarsinate (dma) accounted for 66% and 21%, respectively. fifteen minor urinary arsenicals were quantified with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icpms) coupled to reverse-phase, anion and cation-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). thio-arsenicals and non-thio minor arsenicals (including inorganic as (ias) and methylarsonate (ma)) contributed 10% and 7% of the total sum of species excretion, respectively, but there were large individual differences in the excretion patterns. apparently, formation of thio-arsenicals was negatively correlated to ab formation and excretion, possibly indicating a metabolic interrelationship. the results may be of toxicological relevance since dma and ma have been classified as possibly carcinogenic, and six of the excreted as species were thio-arsenicals which recently have been recognized as toxic, while ias toxicity is well known.

human_metabolism	monitoring human metabolism is of crucial importance for personalized medicine. the aim of the present work is to design an interface circuit to realize an integrated platform for the detection of endogenous and exogenous metabolites for implantable applications. cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry are the most common methods for metabolite detection. we propose a cmos circuit to implement these two methods in a multi- target detection scheme.
genetics	particle markov chain monte carlo (pmcmc) is a stochastic algorithm designed to generate samples from a probability distribution, when the density of the distribution does not admit a closed form expression. pmcmc is most commonly used to sample from the bayesian posterior distribution in state-space models (ssms), a class of probabilistic models used in numerous scientific applications. nevertheless, this task is prohibitive when dealing with complex ssms with massive data, due to the high computational cost of pmcmc and its poor performance when the posterior exhibits multi -modality. this paper aims to address both issues by: 1) proposing a novel pmcmc algorithm (denoted ppmcmc), which uses multiple markov chains (instead of the one used by pmcmc) to improve sampling efficiency for multi-modal posteriors, 2) introducing custom, parallel hardware architectures, which are tailored for pmcmc and ppmcmc. the architectures are implemented on field programmable gate arrays (fpgas), a type of hardware accelerator with massive parallelization capabilities. the new algorithm and the two fpga architectures are evaluated using a large-scale case study from genetics. results indicate that ppmcmc achieves 1.96x higher sampling efficiency than pmcmc when using sequential cpu implementations. the fpga architecture of pmcmc is 12.1x and 10.1x faster than state-of-the-art, parallel cpu and gpu implementations of pmcmc and up to 53x more energy efficient; the fpga architecture of ppmcmc increases these speedups to 34.9x and 41.8x respectively and is 173x more power efficient, bringing previously intractable ssm-based data analyses within reach.

genetics	background: inferring the ancestry of each region of admixed individuals' genomes is useful in studies ranging from disease gene mapping to speciation genetics. current methods require high-coverage genotype data and phased reference panels, and are therefore inappropriate for many data sets. we present a software application, ad-libs, that uses a hidden markov model to infer ancestry across hybrid genomes without requiring variant calling or phasing. this approach is useful for non-model organisms and in cases of low-coverage data, such as ancient dna. results: we demonstrate the utility of ad-libs with synthetic data. we then use ad-libs to infer ancestry in two published data sets: european human genomes with neanderthal ancestry and brown bear genomes with polar bear ancestry. ad-libs correctly infers 87-91% of ancestry in simulations and produces ancestry maps that agree with published results and global ancestry estimates in humans. in brown bears, we find more polar bear ancestry than has been published previously, using both ad-libs and an existing software application for local ancestry inference, hapmix. we validate ad-libs polar bear ancestry maps by recovering a geographic signal within bears that mirrors what is seen in snp data. finally, we demonstrate that ad-libs is more effective than hapmix at inferring ancestry when preexisting phased reference data are unavailable and genomes are sequenced to low coverage. conclusions: ad-libs is an effective tool for ancestry inference that can be used even when few individuals are available for comparison or when genomes are sequenced to low coverage. ad-libs is therefore likely to be useful in studies of non-model or ancient organisms that lack large amounts of genomic dna. ad-libs can therefore expand the range of studies in which admixture mapping is a viable tool.
machine_design	an electrical variable transmission (evt) is an electromagnetic device with dual mechanical and electrical ports. in hybrid electric vehicles (hev 's) it is used to split the power to the wheels in a part coming from the combustion engine and a part exchanged with the battery. the most important feature is that the power splitting is done in an electromagnetic way. this has the advantage over mechanical power splitting devices of reduced maintenance, high efficiency and inherent overload protection. depending on the operating point part of the power is transmitted in an electromagnetic way, while the rest is transmitted electrically using two back to back inverters. the power flow determines the power rating of the inverters, the cooling and the machine design. this paper gives an overview of the different operating points and the corresponding power flow.
human_metabolism	the analysis of the effect of drugs in insulin aggregation is interesting due to its influence on human metabolism. we present a method to analyse the effect of an antiretroviral drug (azt) on the insulin aggregation, based on the principal components analysis of the infrared spectra recorded in the process. this method allows the analysis of the conformational changes involved in the aggregation, providing a time value associated with the aggregates formation. the analysis was performed using zn-free insulin in buffered solution at 1.72 mm concentration. the aggregation was monitored in situ by ftir at 37 degrees c and the dependence of the concentration of azt was considered, contemplating three concentration levels of azt. the interaction between azt and insulin was proved by (hnmr)-h-1 spectroscopy. the aggregation states were characterised by solubility tests and microscope imaging. a comparative analysis of time aggregation led observing that the process was delayed when the concentration of azt was lower than 1.72 mm, while it accelerated at equal or higher concentrations. this dependence was related to the concentration of the monomeric species in the medium. the analysis was performed in serum to evaluate the influence of serum proteins in the phenomena, concluding that azt binds to insulin before than to serum proteins.

molecular_biology	genomic dna is dynamically associated with protein factors and folded to form chromatin fibers. the 3-dimensional (3d) configuration of the chromatin will enable the distal genetic elements to come into close proximity, allowing transcriptional regulation. noncoding rna can mediate the 3d structure of chromatin. chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (chia-pet) is a valuable and powerful technique in molecular biology which allows the study of unbiased, genome-wide de novo chromatin interactions with paired-end tags. here, we describe the standard version of chia-pet and a multiplex chia-pet version.
molecular_biology	two keggin-type polyoxometalates (poms) containing glycine, (hgly)(3)pw12o40 and (hgly)(4)siw12o40, were synthesized and evaluated as mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors. the spectrophotometric method results showed that both (hgly)(3)pw12o40 and (hgly)(4)siw12o40 could strongly inhibit the diphenolase activity of the tyrosinase and that their inhibition mechanisms were reversible. their half-inhibition concentration values were estimated to be 1.55 and 1.39mmol/l, respectively. the inhibition kinetics analysis by lineweaver-burk plots indicated that (hgly)(3)pw12o40 was an uncompetitive inhibitor with k-is=0.046mmol/l, whereas (hgly)(4)siw12o40 was a noncompetitive inhibitor with k-i=k-is=2.17mmol/l. this study may help to extend the application of poms in the fields of medicine and food preservation.

computer-aided_design	fused deposition modeling (fdm) has been recognized as an effective technology to manufacture 3d dimensional parts directly from a digital computer aided design (cad) model in a layer-by-layer style. although it has become a significantly important manufacturing process, but it is still not well accepted additive manufacturing technology for load-carrying parts under dynamic and cyclic conditions due to many processing parameters affecting the part properties. the purpose of this study is to characterize the fdm manufactured parts by detecting how the individual and interactive fdm process parameters will influence the performance of manufactured products under dynamic and cyclic conditions. experiments were conducted through fractional factorial design and artificial neural network (ann). effect of each parameter on the dynamic modulus of elasticity was investigated using analysis of variance (anova) technique. furthermore, optimal processing parameters were determined and validated by conducting verification experiment. the results showed that both ann and fractional factorial models provided good quality predictions, yet the ann showed the superiority of a properly trained ann in capturing the nonlinear relationship of the system over fractional factorial for both data fitting and estimation capabilities.

fluid_mechanics	the piston ring pack is important for the sealing of the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. it plays a major role in friction, wear and oil consumption considerations. both experimental and theoretical studies in this area are difficult due to the complexity of this highly dynamic system. the paper deals with the numerical investigation by means of computational fluid dynamics of the gas and oil flow in the piston ring pack. having been validated with experimental data, the simulation results show gas and oil transport mechanisms, which can be used to improve existing models of 0d/1d-simulations. this leads to a better understanding of the processes in the piston ring pack and helps to further optimize the tribological system.

genetics	the theme of the free availability of genetic information is, by its nature, the heart of attention in most areas of investigation. from biology to medicine, from philosophy to law, from theology to biotechnology there is n't an area of science that cannot be said to be interested in the subject, nor has not, in recent years, tried to deepen it.
hydraulics	discrete fluid power systems featuring transmission lines inherently include pressure oscillations. experimental verification of a discrete fluid power power take off system for wave energy converters has shown the cylinder pressure to oscillate as force shifts are performed. this article investigates how cylinder pressure oscillations may be reduced by shaping the valve opening trajectory without the need for closed loop pressure feedback. furthermore the energy costs of reducing pressure oscillations are investigated.
machine_design	in permanent magnet synchronous machines (pmsm), depending on the machine application, different types of permanent magnets (pm) can be used. the most common pms are ferrite magnets, neodymium iron boron magnets (ndfeb), and samarium cobalt magnets (smco). the selection of a suitable magnet for a particular machine design depends on the magnet properties: remanence, conductivity, mechanical rigidity, losses, and demagnetization characteristics. usually, the possibility of hysteresis losses in pm materials is neglected. in this paper, however, it is demonstrated that possible hysteresis losses have to be evaluated in the machine design. it is shown by measurements and simulations that in some machine designs, hysteresis losses in ndfeb, smco, and ferrite magnets can be a source of significant additional ac losses that may lead to too high pm operating temperatures and a reduction in the machine efficiency.
enzymology	pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen. it colonizes different tissues by the utilization of diverse mechanisms. one of these may involve the breakdown of the host cell membrane through the sequential action of hemolytic phospholipase c and phosphorylcholine phosphatase (pchp). the action of hemolytic phospholipase c on phosphatidylcholine produces phosphorylcholine, which is hydrolyzed to choline (cho) and inorganic phosphate by pchp. the available biochemical data on this enzyme demonstrate the involvement of two cho-binding sites in the catalytic cycle and in enzyme regulation. the crystal structure of p. aeruginosa pchp has been determined. it folds into three structural domains. the first domain harbors all the residues involved in catalysis and is well conserved among the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of proteins. the second domain is characteristic of pchp and is involved in the recognition of the cho moiety of the substrate. the third domain stabilizes the relative position of the other two. fortuitously, the crystal structure of pchp captures molecules of bistris (2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol) at the active site and at an additional site. this represents two catalytically relevant complexes with just one or two inhibitory bistris molecules and provides the basis of the pchp function and regulation. site-directed mutagenesis along with biochemical experiments corroborates the structural observations and demonstrates the interplay between different sites for cho recognition and inhibition. the structural comparison of pchp with other phosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase family provides a three-dimensional picture of the conserved catalytic cycle and the structural basis for the recognition of the diverse substrate molecules.

northern_blotting	agroinfiltration was tested as a method of inoculation of chrysanthemum plants with chrysanthemum stunt viroid (csvd). binary vectors harboring dimeric csvd sequences in sense and antisense orientations were constructed, and agrobacterium transfected with these binary vectors was infiltrated into chrysanthemum leaves. northern blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that local infection was established within 7 days and systemic infection within 20 days. csvd polarities showed no difference in infectivity. this study showed that agroinfiltration of chrysanthemum plants is an easy, rapid, and cost-effective method for csvd inoculation.

human_metabolism	currently, metals are widely used for load-bearing application due to their combination of high mechanical strength and fracture toughness. however, most conventional metallic materials generally remain in human body permanently, bringing long-term endothelial dysfunction. the corrosion products are also considered potentially harmful to tissues of the human body. in recent years, magnesium (mg) alloys had caused significant attention due to their outstanding advantages. mg alloys have mechanical properties similar to bone which avoid stress shielding. they are also biocompatibly essential to the human metabolism as a cofactor for many enzymes. in addition, the corrosion product of mg is likely to be physiologically beneficial. most importantly, they are perfectly biodegradable in the body fluid. no material could match perfectly every requirement for a given application. for mg alloys, the extremely low corrosion resistance in chloride containing environments limits their applications. interactions between biological environments and biomedical materials take place on the material surface, and the biological response from living tissues to these extrinsic biomaterials depends on the surface properties. therefore, surface modification to form a hard, biocompatible and corrosion resistant modified layer has recently become an interesting topic in biomaterials. this paper reviews the current research and development status of plasma surface modification technologies of mg alloy for biomedical materials. the unique advantage of plasma modification is that the surface properties and biocompatibility can be enhanced selectively while excellent bulk properties remain unchanged. this paper discusses the characteristic of different methods. finally, the scientific challenges are proposed based on our researches and the works done by other groups.

southern_blotting	prevalence estimates for fragile x syndrome vary considerably. this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to provide an accurate prevalence estimate for this disorder using primary publications in pubmed, embase, and the cochrane library. data were pooled using bayesian fixed-effects and random-effects models. primary analyses assessed the frequency of the full mutation and premutation in males and females in the total population (no bias against individuals with intellectual disability) and in female carriers of the premutation in normal populations (biased against individuals with intellectual disability), based on diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction or southern blotting. a sensitivity analysis included studies using any diagnostic testing method and conference abstracts. sixty-eight recorded observations provided data for the primary (56 observations) and sensitivity (12 observations) analysis. using the random-effects model, frequency of the full mutation was 1.4 (95% ci: 0.1-3.1) per 10,000 males and 0.9 (95% ci: 0.0-2.9) per 10,000 females (1:7,143 and 1:11,111, respectively) in the total population. the premutation frequency was 11.7 (95% ci: 6.0-18.7) per 10,000 males and 34.4 (95% ci: 6.3-83.3) per 10,000 for females (1:855 and 1:291, respectively) in the total population. the prevalence of female carriers of the premutation in the normal population was 34.4 (95% ci: 8.9-60.3) per 10,000, or 1:291. sensitivity analyses resulted in similar prevalence estimates but with wider heterogeneity. prevalence estimates for the full mutation from this meta-analysis are lower than those in previous reviews of fragile x syndrome epidemiological data.

internal_combustion_engine	the success of electric vehicles (evs) greatly depends on battery size, cost, lifetime, and capacity. the battery capacity of evs has to contain enough energy to allow ev users to drive, at least, the minimum distance that internal combustion engine vehicles take. however, even with very efficient evs and combining all the available highly efficient ev technologies, the battery capacity still needs to be large. thus, one alternative to reduce the battery size is to improve the charging infrastructure by implementing sufficient public/private fast-charging locations, which will significantly increase the ev driving range with relatively low battery capacities. however, this kind of infrastructure requires charging with higher current capability, due to the high power levels involved in the fast-charging process. in this paper, a bidirectional dc/dc converter with six inverter legs connected to a three-phase output is proposed. the converter is similar to a three-phase dual-active-bridge (dab) converter with more inverter legs in parallel. these additional inverter legs increase the converter current capability, without affecting the dab main characteristics, preserving similar modulation techniques and dab advantages. an accurate study about the proposed topology is carried out in this paper, and simulations and experimental results are shown for a 20-kw prototype, validating the theoretical analysis.
immunology	the importance of neuro-immune interactions in both physiological and pathophysiological states cannot be overstated. as our appreciation for the neuroimmune nature of the brain and spinal cord grows, so does our need to extend the spatial and temporal resolution of our molecular analysis techniques. current imaging technologies applied to investigate the actions of the neuroimmune system in both health and disease states have been adapted from the fields of immunology and neuroscience. while these classical techniques have provided immense insight into the function of the cns, they are however, inherently limited. thus, the development of innovative methods which overcome these limitations are crucial for imaging and quantifying acute and chronic neuroimmune responses. therefore, this review aims to convey emerging novel and complementary imaging technologies in a form accessible to medical scientists engaging in neuroimmune research.

northern_blotting	mesangial re-modeling and mesangial cell (mc) migration are features of several glomerular diseases including mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. in vitro investigations have recently identified adam-15, a multidomain adamalysin, as central to the migration of mc. the current study used array technology to investigate the expression of other genes in migrating cells and identified pleiotrophin (ptn), platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide chain, colony stimulating factor, and four members of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha superfamily as major genes that were upregulated. transcriptional induction of ptn was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting and induction of the protein by western blotting and immunohistochemical localization. ptn was observed associated with mesangial 'hillocks' in confluent mc cultures. in contrast, in models of migration, migrating cells had the highest expression of cell-associated ptn. ptn protein was less evident, however, in the conditioned medium of mcs. treatment of mc with heparanase removed ptn from the cells suggesting that its localization was owing to an association with heparan sulfates on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. this is the first description of the expression of ptn by human mcs and the data suggest that it is rapidly induced in cells that are triggered to migrate. the result of this induction is currently under investigation.
fluid_mechanics	removing geometric details from the computational domain can significantly reduce the complexity of downstream task of meshing and simulation computation, and increase their stability. proper estimation of the sensitivity analysis error induced by removing such domain details, called defeaturing errors, can ensure that the sensitivity analysis fidelity can still be met after simplification. in this paper, estimation of impacts of removing arbitrarily constrained domain details to the analysis of incompressible fluid flows is studied with applications to fast analysis of incompressible fluid flows in complex environments. the derived error estimator is applicable to geometric details constrained by either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions, and has no special requirements on the outer boundary conditions. extensive numerical examples were presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed error estimator.
immunology	introduction: c1q play an important role in clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cell debris. impaired clearance leads to exposure of c1 native antigen and development of anti-c1q antibody formation. anti-c1q antibody is well studied in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). significance of anti-c1q ab in indian sle patients and their clinical manifestations is not clear. aim: the aim of this study was to investigate associations between anti-c1q antibody and clinical as well as serological markers of sle. materials and methods: retrospective study of sle patients fulfilling either american college of rheumatology (acr) 1990 or systemic lupus international collaborating clinics (slicc) 2012 classification criteria were recruited from inpatients and outpatients services of the clinical immunology and rheumatology department, christian medical college at vellore, india between march 2013 and january 2015. anti-c1q antibody was assayed by elisa (demeditec diagnostics gmbh, germany). logistic regression analysis was performed to find the association of anti-c1q antibodies with serological and clinical parameters in sle including lupus nephritis (ln). results: sixty nine patients (54.76%) out of 126 sle patients had ln. anti-c1q levels were higher in patients with ln as compared to those without (p<0.05). anti-c1q antibody was also significantly associated with positive c1q immunofluorescence staining in renal biopsy specimens (p<0.05). overall, renal systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (sledai) {or 1.35 (1.08-1.69)}, low c4 {or 3.11 (1.04-9.26)} and mucocutaneous manifestation {or 4.72 (1.38-16.05)} were independently associated with anti-c1q levels in serum. conclusion: renal sledai, low c4 and mucocutaneous manifestations were independently associated with raised anti c1q antibody in sle patients.
human_metabolism	structured triglycerides (stg) are introduced for clinical purpose by a recently registered lipid emulsion, in which long-chain fatty acids and medium-chain fatty acids are randomly attached to the same glycerol molecule. studies in animals showed an improvement in nitrogen balance. studies in patients demonstrate an improvement or at least equivalent effects on the nitrogen balance, compared with lct or a physical mixture of mct and lct. in most of the studies serum triglycerides, and free fatty acid concentrations are lower indicating a faster clearance from the blood; beta-oh-butyrate concentrations are higher but do not reach toxic levels, or influence the serum ph value. no modulatory effects on the immune system by stg can be demonstrated. hypotheses are discussed of the influence of lipids on protein metabolism. the recently introduced stg open the door for really new structured triglycerides in which on-demand specific fatty acids can be linked to a specific position at the glycerol molecule, with the objective of realising specific clinical effects.

human_metabolism	magnesium (mg) is naturally found in bone tissue and is essential to human metabolism. it is well known that mg ion improved bone-like apatite nucleation and growth. in this study, mg ions were ion exchanged onto poly acrylic acid (paa) thin film containing the carboxyl groups deposited on the commercially pure titanium (cp-ti) surface using a plasma polymerization at discharge power 50 w for 5 min. surface morphology and chemical composition of all samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem), x-ray diffraction (xrd), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). bioactivity of the mg ion exchanged cp-ti samples was evaluated by immersing in simulated body fluid (sbf) and mc3t3-e1 cell proliferation. the bone-like apatite forming ability was significantly influenced by mg ion concentrations. mg ion promotes bone-like apatite nucleation and growth on cp-ti surface in sbf solution and improves mc3t3-e1 cell proliferation. it is therefore expected that cp-ti and ti alloys having a high biocompatibility can be obtained by ion exchanging the mg ion after paa plasma modified ti surface.

computer-aided_design	parametric and implicit methods are traditionally thought to be two irrelevant approaches in structural shape optimization. parametric method works as a lagrangian approach and often uses the parametric boundary representation (b-rep) of curves/surfaces, for example, bezier and b-splines in combination with the conformal mesh of a finite element model, while implicit method relies upon level-set functions, that is, implicit functions for b-rep, and works as an eulerian approach in combination with the fixed mesh within the scope of extended finite element method or finite cell method. the original contribution of this work is the unification of both methods. first, a new shape optimization method is proposed by combining the features of the parametric and implicit b-reps. shape changes of the structural boundary are governed by parametric b-rep on the fixed mesh to maintain the merit in computer-aided design modeling and avoid laborious remeshing. second, analytical shape design sensitivity is formulated for the parametric b-rep in the framework of fixed mesh of finite cell method by means of the hamilton-jacobi equation. numerical examples are solved to illustrate the unified methodology. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
fluid_mechanics	linear momentum actuator disc theory is extended to address the power available to a tidal turbine array spanning the cross-section of an open channel flow. a generalised formulation is presented, which relaxes constraints in previous models on the froude number of the flow and the geometry of the turbine array, and also considers the effects of far-wake mixing on the overall power removed from the flow. in the limiting case of no free surface deformation, the rigid lid model is recovered. blockage, the ratio of turbine frontal area to the cross-sectional area of the surrounding flow passage, has the greatest effect on available power, with the peak power coefficient increasing by 55% from 0.60 to 0.93 as the blockage ratio increases from 0.05 to 0.20. a further 3% increase in peak power coefficient is achieved as the froude number increases from 0.05 to 0.20. the efficiency of energy extraction may be determined relative to the total power extracted from the flow, comprising the power available to the turbines, and the power dissipated in wake mixing. higher blockage turbines operating at low thrust coefficients are shown to be more efficient than lower blockage turbines.
enzymology	covalently interstrand cross-linked dna is an interesting tool to study dna binding proteins that locally open up the dna duplex by flipping single bases out of the dna helix or melting whole stretches of base pairs to perform their function. the ideal dna cross-link to study protein-dna interactions should be specific and easy to synthesize, be stable during protein binding experiments, have a short covalent linker to avoid steric hindrance of protein binding, and should be available as a mimic for both a/t and g/c base pairs to cover all possible binding specificities. several covalent interstrand cross-links have been described in the literature, but most of them fall short of at least one of the above criteria. we developed an efficient method to site-specifically and reversibly cross-link thionucleoside base pairs in synthetic duplex oligodeoxynucleotides by bisalkylation with 1,2-diiodoethane resulting in an ethylene-bridged base pair. both linked a/t and g/c base pair analogs can conveniently be prepared which allows studying any base pair-opening enzyme regardless of its sequence specificity. the cross-link is stable in the absence of reducing agents but the linker can be quickly and tracelessly removed by the addition of thiol reagents like dithiothreitol. this property makes the cross-linking reaction fully reversible and allows for a switching of the linked base pair from locked to unlocked during biochemical experiments. using the dna methyltransferase from thermus aquaticus (m. taqi) as example, we demonstrate that the presented cross-linked dna with an ethylene-linked a/t base pair analog at the target position is a useful tool to determine the base-flipping equilibrium constant of a base-flipping enzyme which lies mostly on the extrahelical side for m. taqi.
enzymology	this study was performed to culture and preliminarily identify the primordial germ cells (pgcs) isolated from the genital ridge of the mongolian sheep fetus. the growth characteristics of the sheep pgcs were detected in different culture systems such as culture media, resources, and state and passages of feeder cells. the obtained embryonic germ (eg) cells were identified by morphology, enzymology, and immunofluorescence. the results showed that the sheep eg cell colonies were ridgy, typically nest like, and compact, and had regular edges. alkaline phosphatase staining reaction was weakly positive. eg cells expressed kit, rex-1, nanog, and oct-4. immunofluorescence detection was weakly positive for oct3/4, whereas positive for ssea-1, ssea-3, ssea-4, tra-1-61, and tra-1-80.
manufacturing_engineering	joint industry-academia projects with regional industry have influenced creation of florida 's first coast manufacturing innovation partnership. the development of the collaboration has the primary goals of project-centered innovations for technology transfer, training the regional workforce with relevance to industry, and sustainability of technology transfer through creation of high-technology jobs. by providing an experiential education in manufacturing systems automation and design in the undergraduate engineering curriculum, engineering students are better prepared upon entering the workforce. initial projects leading to the development of the manufacturing innovation partnerships are outlined, followed by the description of the structure to further expand the scope of experiential project-centered engineering education in design and manufacturing systems engineering.
cell_biology	despite the considerable progress in the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) therapy, relapse or progression to a richter syndrome still appears. thus, a more targeted therapeutic option is required. this can be achieved by increasing the concentration of the cytostatic drug in the tumour while reducing its systemic toxicity. in the continuous effort toward the development of more efficient therapeutics, in the current study we report rituximab conjugated gold nanoparticles for cll treatment. the formation of rituximab-nanoconjugates was proved by physico-chemical characterization (uv-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential and dynamic light scattering) and their intracellular internalization was assessed by dark field and transmission electron microscopy. the therapeutic effect of the newly-designed drugs was investigated by cell counting and mit assays. results showed that the effect of our drug-nanocarrier is superior compared to that of the drug alone, data confirmed by state-of-the-art analyses of internalization, cell biology (flow cytometry, apoptosis and autophagy assay), genomics (rt-pcr for ms4a1) and proteomics (confocal microscopy and western blotting for cd20). the present work demonstrates that rituximab nanoconjugates can get an efficient trans-membrane delivery inside cll cells, being validated as real-potential therapeutics with increased efficacy compared to the drug alone.
computer-aided_design	the monte carlo method was used for quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling of bis-quinolinium and bis-isoquinolinium compounds as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors for a series of 36 compounds. quantitative structure-activity relationship models were calculated with the representation of the molecular structure by the simplified molecular input-line entry system. one split into the training and test set was examined. the statistical quality of the developed model was good. the best calculated quantitative structure-activity relationship model had following statistical parameters: r (2) = 0.8097 for the training set and r (2) = 0.9372 for the test set. structural indicators defined as molecular fragments responsible for increases and decreases in the inhibition activity were calculated. the computer-aided design of new compounds as potential acetylcholine esterase inhibitors with the application of defined structural alerts was presented.
immunology	mucosal immunity at the intestinal level is constantly challenged by the presence of external food and microbial antigens and must be kept under strict control to avoid the rise of aberrant inflammation. among cells of the innate immunity, macrophages expressing the chemokine receptor cx3cr1 are strategically located near the gut epithelial barrier. these cells contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10; however, their role in the control of full blown inflammation and tissue injury is controversial. in this study we investigated mice proficient or deficient for the expression of the cx3cr1 receptor in a model of dextran sulphate sodium (dss) induced acute colitis. we found that ko mice (cx3cr1(gfp/gfp)) had a more severe disease compared to wt mice (cx3cr1(gfp/+)), both in terms of histological examination of colonic tissues and leukocyte infiltration, with an expansion of macrophages and cd4-th17 lymphocytes. the expression of several inflammatory mediators (il-1 beta, il-6, ifn gamma, inos) was also significantly upregulated in ko mice, despite higher il-10 production. overall, our study demonstrates that macrophages expressing a functional cx3cr1 receptor have an important and non-redundant role in controlling the abnormal intestinal inflammation that may lead to tissue damage.

hydraulics	efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. we tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. we measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (sg) and 10 fast growing (fg) fraxinus ornus l. trees. branches of sg trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35 cm year(-1)), and produced a higher leaf biomass (p < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (p0.05) and xylem safety (psi(50) approximate to -3.2 mpa). slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.
cell_biology	natural killer (nk)-cells are major players in the fight against viral infections and transformed cells, but there is increasing evidence attributing a disease-promoting role to nk-cells. cytokines present in the tumor microenvironment shape nk-cell maturation, function, and effector responses. many cytokines signal via the janus kinase (jak)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) pathway that is also frequently altered and constitutively active in a broad range of tumor cells. as a consequence, there are currently major efforts to develop therapeutic strategies to target this pathway. therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the role and contributions of jak-stat molecules in nk-cell biology-only this knowledge will allow us to predict effects of jak-stat inhibition for nk-cell functions and to successfully apply precision medicine. we will review the current knowledge on the role of jak-stat signaling for nk-cell functions and discuss conditions involved in the switch from nk-cell tumor surveillance to disease promotion.
immunology	neoantigen is a patient-specific tumor antigen resulted from mutations during oncogenesis. emerging data suggested that immune responsiveness against neoantigens correlated with the success of clinical tumor immunotherapies. nowadays, the majority of studies on neoantigens have focused on mhc class i restricted antigens recognized by cd8+ t cells. with improved understanding of the underlying principles of tumor biology and immunology, increasing emphasis has been put on cd4+ t cells and mhc class ii restricted antigens. mhc class ii restricted neoantigen has the potential to be a promising target of tumor immunotherapy, although the limited comprehension and technical difficulties need to be overcome before being applied into clinical practice. this review discussed the immunologic mechanism, screening technique, clinical application, limitations and prospectives of mhc class ii restricted neoantigens in tumor immunotherapy. cd (c) 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
immunology	characterizing the immune response to pneumococcal proteins is critical in understanding this bacterium 's epidemiology and vaccinology. probing a custom-designed proteome microarray with sera from 35 healthy us adults revealed a continuous distribution of igg affinities for 2,190 potential antigens from the species-wide pangenome. reproducibly elevated igg binding was elicited by 208 ""antibody binding targets"" (abts), which included 109 variants of the diverse pneumococcal surface proteins a and c (pspa and pspc) and zinc metalloprotease a and b (zmpa and zmpb) proteins. functional analysis found abts were enriched inmotifs for secretion and cell surface association, with extensive representation of cell wall synthesis machinery, adhesins, transporter solute-binding proteins, and degradative enzymes. abts were associated with stronger evidence for evolving under positive selection, although this varied between functional categories, as did rates of diversification through recombination. particularly rapid variation was observed at some immunogenic accessory loci, including a phage protein and a phase-variable glycosyltransferase ubiquitous among the diverse set of genomic islands encoding the serine-rich psrp glycoprotein. nevertheless, many antigens were conserved in the core genome, and strains' antigenic profiles were generally stable. no strong evidence was found for any epistasis between antigens driving population dynamics, or redundancy between functionally similar accessory abts, or age stratification of antigen profiles. these results highlight the paradox of why substantial variation is observed in only a subset of epitopes. this result may indicate only some interactions between immunoglobulins and abts clear pneumococcal colonization or that acquired immunity to pneumococci is an accumulation of individually weak responses to abts evolving under different levels of functional constraint.
human_metabolism	this research is a framework of a big project aimed to the knowledge of human metabolism in hemodialysis patients. for reaching high sensitivity and obtaining accurate values for elements at very low concentrations instrumental neutron activation analysis (inaa) was used for its characteristics to be a primary analytical method and because it does not require any chemical-physical pretreatment. the samples analyzed (160) are representative of groups of homogeneous population and specific matrices (hemodialysis fluids and whole human blood). the irradiation was performed in the rotating rack (lazy susan) of the triga mark ii reactor of the r.c. casaccia-enea at a neutron flux of 2.6 x 10(12) n cm(-2) s(-1) with an irradiation time of 12 h. the results on the hemodialysis fluids report the values and the behavior of selected trace elements: the levels of br and na show a decrease between the pre- and post-dialysis whereas fe, k and zn an increase. the other elements such as cs, rb and se seem to keep constant between the two phases. similar data are found for the whole human blood for the same selected elements. finally, exploiting the inaa peculiarity it has been investigated the levels of trace and ultra-trace elements interesting from a toxicological (hg, ni, sb) and nutritional (co, cr) point of view and seldom determined due to their analytical implications. finally, a chemiometric investigation performed through dendrogram trees, canonical discriminant analysis and principal component analysis, has evidenced the similar effects of the hf, hdf and bic-treatments on the investigated fluids respect to the capd dialysis.
molecular_biology	biomineralogy is an inherently interdisciplinary pursuit. this largely stems from the fact that techniques used to investigate a given (bio)mineral should ideally be married with techniques that provide insight into the biological mechanisms that form that mineral (and vice versa). we observe two broad challenges that inhibit a fluent exchange of ideas and information between mineralogists/materials scientists and biologists. first, the smorgasbord of emerging and rapidly evolving techniques available to mineralogists and biologists alike make it difficult not only for an expert to remain contemporary, but can be bewildering to the non-expert. second, to truly integrate and relate a specific biological insight into the genesis of a biomineral, with the effect that insight has on the properties of the mineral itself, is not trivial. we propose that an evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) approach can not only address this challenge, it can also provide deep insight into how the rich diversity of metazoan mineralised structures evolved. while an evo-devo approach to biomineralogy has previously been employed by some groups, recent exciting methodological developments available to the molecular biologist now make this strategy even more attractive. in this short review we aim to outline our perception of the role that evo-devo can play within the field of biomineralogy, taking as a case study the past achievements, recent insights and some future research directions associated with gastropod shell formation.

molecular_biology	the intervertebral disc (ivd) is a joint unique in structure and functions. lying between adjacent vertebrae, it provides both the primary support and the elasticity required for the spine to move stably. various aspects of the ivd have long been studied by researchers seeking a better understanding of its dynamics, aging, and subsequent disorders. in this article, we review the surgical anatomy, imaging modalities, and molecular biology of the lumbar ivd. clin. anat. 30:251-266, 2017.

computer-aided_design	the die model characterized with high design efficiency and strong correlation plays an important role in simulation and machining. because of the complexity of structure and the changing shape of flow channel, current design tools lack in the level of automation so that design of an extrusion die is a nontrivial task. in this paper, an integral design method is proposed to improve the design efficiency and model correlation. the computer-aided design (cad) system for plastic profile extrusion die is designed and implemented by integrating visual studio 2010 (vs2010) and unigraphics nx (ug). the closed loop recognition algorithm (clr), multi closed loops intelligent recognition (mclr) algorithm, and multi closed loops matching (mclm) algorithm based on feature recognition are proposed to realize automatic generation of ruled surface in flow channel. the integral design and automatic generation methods of die set are proposed to facilitate efficient formation of different structures and process holes. the particle swarm optimization (pso) algorithm is put forward to obtain best position and specification for the interference parts. three modules (integral sketches, integral flow channel, and integral die set) are developed, which focus on integrating the proposed automation design methods into their framework. a case application on die design is used to illustrate the proposed method. the results show that the developed cad system not only improves the design efficiency of extrusion die but also enhances the design quality.
enzymology	vitamin b-6 is a generic term referring to pyridoxine. pyridoxamine, pyridoxal and their related phosphorylated forms. pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is the catalytically active form of vitamin b-6, and acts as cofactor in more than 140 different enzyme reactions. in animals, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is recycled from food and from degraded b-6-enzymes in a ""salvage pathway"", which essentially involves two ubiquitous enzymes: an atp-dependent pyridoxal kinase and an fmn-dependent pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase. once it is made, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is targeted to the dozens of different apo-b-6 enzymes that are being synthesized in the cell. the mechanism and regulation of the salvage pathway and the mechanism of addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to the apo-b-6-enzymes are poorly understood and represent a very challenging research field. pyridoxal kinase and pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase play kinetic roles in regulating the level of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate formation. deficiency of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate due to inborn defects of these enzymes seems to be involved in several neurological pathologies. in addition, inhibition of pyridoxal kinase activity by several pharmaceutical and natural compounds is known to lead to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate deficiency. understanding the exact role of vitamin b-6 in these pathologies requires a better knowledge on the metabolism and homeostasis of the vitamin. this article summarizes the current knowledge on structural, kinetic and regulation features of the two enzymes involved in the plp salvage pathway. we also discuss the proposal that newly formed plp may be transferred from either enzyme to apo-b-6-enzymes by direct channeling, an efficient, exclusive, and protected means of delivery of the highly reactive plp. this new perspective may lead to novel and interesting findings, as well as serve as a model system for the study of macromolecular channeling. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phosphate enzymology.

computer-aided_design	modeling of scientific or engineering applications often yields high-dimensional dynamical systems due to techniques of computer-aided-design, for example. thus a model order reduction is required to decrease the dimensionality and to enable an efficient numerical simulation. in addition, methods of parameterized model order reduction (pmor) are often used to preserve the physical or geometric parameters as independent variables in the reduced order models. we consider linear dynamical systems in the form of ordinary differential equations. in the domain of the parameters, often samples are chosen to construct a reduced order model. for each sample point a common technique for model order reduction can be applied to compute a local basis. moment matching or balanced truncation are feasible, for example. a global basis for pmor can be constructed from the local bases by a singular value decomposition. we investigate approaches for an appropriate selection of a finite set of samples. the transfer function of the dynamical system is examined in the frequency domain, and our focus is on moment matching techniques using the arnoldi procedure. we use a sensitivity analysis of the transfer function with respect to the parameters as a tool to select sample points. simulation results are shown for two examples.

machine_design	this paper presents various experimental tests on the sensorless capability of induction motors (im). an intentionally created saliency is introduced in the rotor so as to allow the rotor position to be estimated by means of a high-frequency (hf) injected signal in the stator winding. experimental measurements are carried out on three prototypes, two with saliency and the third without saliency, as reference. the critical aspects in the prototype realization are discussed in this paper. suggestion on how to solve them from the machine design point of view is included. the rotor saliency has been measured by means of an hf injection. then, the steady-state performance has been measured, together with the mechanical characteristic of the three prototypes. fe analysis is used to predict the variation of the im parameters with rotor position. the results are compared with those achieved from measurements.
genetics	the goal for using genetic information derived from embryo samples is to gain insight into the reproductive biology of adult white sturgeon, acipenser transmontanus richardson. the relationship between egg development stages on the extraction of quality dna was determined, and subsequent genotype data were used to infer contributing spawner numbers. white sturgeon dna was present in extractions from all stages; however, pre-gastrulation stage embryos generally failed to amplify sufficient genetic loci for analysis. using experimentally created families, multivariate anova and maximum-likelihood sibship methods estimated the presence of 10 contributing parents from 11 actual adult spawners. it was observed that unidentified half-sibling relationships (offspring sharing one parent) caused error for inferring parent numbers. genetic methods estimated 13-40 parents potentially contributed to a collection of wild-caught embryos, with variable numbers of parents inferred from separate spawning events (varying from 8 to 24). egg source material provides a means to enhance the accuracy of annual spawning population size estimates, which is important for informing habitat restoration, harvest and water management decisions and recovery planning.
materials_engineering	the purpose here is to study patterns of project collaboration found in one government supported programme for construction innovation. preferred types of interaction were identified using data from two questionnaire surveys, one with experienced construction sector respondents and one aimed at construction researchers. all sixteen development projects within the swedish bygginnovationen programme were investigated, relying on documents and a survey of project managers. important types of interaction, according to construction respondents, are informal contacts, joint research projects and staff mobility. for university respondents, informal contacts is also seen as the most important type of interaction, followed by msc thesis work in firms and industrial phd candidates. grant applicants from manufacturing depended more on university laboratories and were less sensitive to firm/university distance. laboratory use was also more frequent for projects relying on the field of materials engineering. in conclusion, there is a consensus about which types of collaboration are valuable. the broadness of participation in the programme, ranging over many industries, both as to origin of ideas and ultimate applications, reaches beyond narrow interpretations of the construction industry. policy makers should recognize the innovation importance of university laboratory facilities and field testing, rather than seeing researchers as sources of ideas.
genetics	quantitative genetics theory predicts adaptive evolution to be constrained along evolutionary lines of least resistance. in theory, hybridization and subsequent interspecific gene flow may, however, rapidly change the evolutionary constraints of a population and eventually change its evolutionary potential, but empirical evidence is still scarce. using closely related species pairs of lake victoria cichlids sampled from four different islands with different levels of interspecific gene flow, we tested for potential effects of introgressive hybridization on phenotypic evolution in wild populations. we found that these effects differed among our study species. constraints measured as the eccentricity of phenotypic variance-covariance matrices declined significantly with increasing gene flow in the less abundant species for matrices that have a diverged line of least resistance. in contrast, we find no such decline for the more abundant species. overall our results suggest that hybridization can change the underlying phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, potentially increasing the adaptive potential of such populations.
northern_blotting	plants employ rna silencing as a natural defense mechanism against viruses. as a counter-defense, viruses encode silencing suppressor proteins (ssps) that suppress rna silencing. most, but not all, the p0 proteins encoded by poleroviruses have been identified as ssp. in this study, we demonstrated that cotton leafroll dwarf virus (clrdv, genus polerovirus) p0 protein suppressed local silencing that was induced by sense or inverted repeat transgenes in agrobacterium co-infiltration assay in nicotiana benthamiana plants. a clrdv full-length infectious cdna clone that is able to infect n. benthamiana through agrobacterium-mediated inoculation also inhibited local silencing in co-infiltration assays, suggesting that the p0 protein exhibits similar rna silencing suppression activity when expressed from the full-length viral genome. on the other hand, the p0 protein did not efficiently inhibit the spread of systemic silencing signals. moreover, northern blotting indicated that the p0 protein inhibits the generation of secondary but not primary small interfering rnas. the study of clrdv p0 suppression activity may contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of cotton blue disease by clrdv infection.

immunology	objective: the objective of this study was to determine the contribution of lymphatic tissue to heterotopic ossification (ho). background: ho is the pathologic development of ectopic bone within soft tissues often following severe trauma. characterization of the tissue niche supporting ho is critical to identifying therapies directed against this condition. lymphangiogenesis is upregulated during incidents of trauma, thereby coincident with the niche supportive of ho. we hypothesized that lymphatic tissues play a critical role in ho formation. methods: mice underwent hindlimb achilles' tendon transection and dorsal burn injury (burn/tenotomy) to induce ho. the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were excised ipsilateral to the tenotomy site. flow cytometry and immunostaining were used to quantify and localize lymphoendothelium. microct was used to quantify ho. results: enrichment of mature lymphatic tissues was noted 2 weeks after injury at the tendon transection sites when compared with the contralateral, intact tendon based on lyve1+ tubules (10.9% vs 0.8%, p < 0.05). excision of the inguinal and popliteal nodes with draining popliteal lymphatic vessel significantly decreased the presence of mature lymphoendothelium 2 weeks after injury (10.9% vs 3.3%, p < 0.05). bone-cartilage-stromal progenitor cells (cd105+/alphav+/tie2-/cd45-/cd90-/bp1-) were also significantly decreased after lymph node excision (10.2% vs 0.5%, p < 0.05). a significant decrease was noted in the volume of de novo hopresent within the soft tissues (0.12 mm(3) vs 0.02 mm(3)). conclusion: these findings suggest that lymphatic vessels are intimately linked with the de novo formation bone within soft tissues following trauma, and their presence may facilitate bone formation.
genetics	background: rare conditions can be catastrophic for families and the implications for public health can be substantial. our study compared basic surveillance through active medical record review with a linked administrative data file to assess the number of cases of two rare conditions, fragile x syndrome (fxs) and muscular dystrophy (md) in a population. methods: two methods of data collection were used to collect information from five counties comprising two standard metropolitan statistical areas of south carolina. the passive system relied mostly on health claims data using icd-9 cm diagnostic codes. the active system relied on a nurse abstracting records from a list of all licensed physicians with specialties in neurology, orthopedics, and genetics. results: there were 141 fxs cases and 348 md cases that met the case definitions using active surveillance. additional cases were found for both conditions but they were determined to not be true cases. after linking the actively collected md and fxs cases to passive datasets, we found that the estimated total numbers of cases were similar to using capture-recapture analysis; the positive predictive values for cases identified in the passive system were 56.6% for md and 75.7% for fxs. conclusions: applying capture-recapture methods to passively collected surveillance data for rare health conditions produced an estimate of the number of true cases that was similar to that obtained through active data collection.
genetics	the role of the intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in the maintenance of host health and development of metabolic disease has gained significant attention over the past decade. mechanistic insight revealing causality, however, is scarce. work by ussar and co-workers demonstrates that a complex interaction between microbiota, host genetics and environmental factors is involved in metabolic disease development in mice. in addition, perry and coworkers show that the microbial metabolite acetate augments insulin resistance in rats. these studies underscore an important role of the microbiota in the development of obesity and symptoms of type 2 diabetes in rodents. if causality can be demonstrated in humans, development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools that target the gut microbiota will have high potential.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper proposes a torque control strategy to charge the battery of parallel hybrid electric vehicles (hevs), in which the charge torque by an internal combustion engine (ice) is newly introduced. in our previous paper, only regenerative braking was used to charge the battery. however, this is not sufficient for co2 and nox emissions reduction, and thus, a more effective energy management system (ems) should be developed. to maintain the battery state of charge (soc), a target soc is also introduced in the charge torque. in addition, a charge driving condition where the charge torque by the ice is generated is newly proposed. by introducing the charge driving, the ice driving region on torque-engine speed plane was reduced. as a result, a greater reduction in co2 and nox emissions is expected. based on the ems proposed in our previous papers, an ems incorporating the charge driving is developed. through typical driving cycles, the validity of the proposed ems algorithm incorporating the charge driving is examined.
northern_blotting	potato is one of the main targets for genetic improvement by gene transfer. the aim of the present study was to establish a robust protocol for the genetic transformation of three dihaploid and four economically important cultivars of potato using agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the in vivo screenable reporter gene for green fluorescent protein (gfp) and the marker gene for neomycin phosphotransferase (nptii). stem and leaf explants were used for transformation by agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba4404 carrying the binary vector phb2892. kanamycin selection, visual screening of gfp by epifluorescent microscopy, pcr amplification of nptii and gfp genes, as well as rt-pcr and southern blotting of gfp and northern blotting of nptii, were used for transgenic plant selection, identification and analysis. genetic transformation was optimized for the best performing genotypes with a mean number of shoots expressing gfp per explant of 13 and 2 (dihaploid line 178/10 and cv. 'baltica', respectively). the nptii marker and gfp reporter genes permitted selection and excellent visual screening of transgenic tissues and plants. they also revealed the effects of antibiotic selection on organogenesis and transformation frequency, and the identification of escapes and chimeras in all potato genotypes. silencing of the gfp transgene that may represent site-specific inactivation during cell differentiation, occurred in some transgenic shoots of tetraploid cultivars and in specific chimeric clones of the dihaploid line 178/10. the regeneration of escapes could be attributed to either the protection of non-transformed cells by neighbouring transgenic cells, or the persistence of agrobacterium cells in plant tissues after co-cultivation.
fluid_mechanics	this paper presents the results of an experimental model study of the transient loading of steam generator tubes during a postulated main steam line break (mslb) accident in a nuclear power plant. the problem involves complex transient two-phase flow dynamics and fluid-structural loading processes. a better understanding of this phenomenon will permit the development of improved design tools to ensure steam generator tube integrity. the pressure and temperature were measured upstream and downstream of a sectional model of a tube bundle in cross-flow, and the transient tube loads were directly measured using dynamic piezoelectric load cells. high-speed videos were taken to observe and better understand the flow phenomena causing the tube loading. the working fluid was r-134a and the tube bundle was a normal triangular array with a pitch ratio of 1.36. the flow through the bundle was choked for the majority of the transient. the transient tube loading is explained in terms of the associated fluid mechanics. an empirical model is developed that enables the prediction of the maximum tube loads once the pressure drop is known.
molecular_biology	background: arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as model organism in plant biology. although not of agronomic significance, it offers important advantages for basic research in genetics and molecular biology including the availability of a large number of mutants and genetically modified lines. however, arabidopsis seed longevity is limited and seeds stored for more than 10 years usually show a very low capacity for germination. results: the influence of ultrasonic stimulation was investigated on the germination of a. thaliana l. seeds. all experiments have been performed using a frequency of 45 khz at constant temperature ( 24 degrees c). no germination rate differences were observed when using freshly collected seeds. however, using artificially deteriorated seeds, our results show that short ultrasonic stimulation (<1 min) significantly increased germination. ultrasonic stimulation application of 30 s is the optimal treatment. a significant increase in the germination rate was also verified in naturally aged seeds after ultrasonic stimulation. scanning electron microscopy observations showed an increase in the presence of pores in the seed coat after sonication that may be the cause, at least in part, of the increase in germination. the ultrasound treated seeds developed normally to mature fertile plants. conclusions: ultrasound technology can be used to enhance the germination process of old arabidopsis seeds without negatively affecting seedling development. this effect seems to be, at least in part, due to the opening of pores in the seed coat. the use of ultrasonic stimulation in arabidopsis seeds may contribute to the recovering of long time stored lines.
manufacturing_engineering	a national science foundation (nsf) sponsored project was initiated in 2011 at the department of mechanical and manufacturing engineering (mme), miami university, with the aim of creating online learning modules to increase the efficacy of the coursework. the modules were designed to instil proficiency in computational and experimental analysis, and were grouped along five thematic lines in the form of subject studios. the modules contain multimedia content and are designed for use as supplementary course material, or independently by students in preparation for research tasks or review of specific concepts from prior courses. when used to augment existing courses, a salient feature of the modules is the ability to introduce lab/experiment derived content to lecture-only course formats. this has been found to be particularly effective in engaging students and enabling the introduction of new topics with minimal disruption to the existing daily syllabus of a course. the project 's development and implementation phase will end mid-year. since assessment and continuous improvement were integral parts of the project, this paper presents data from the two year assessment process and describes the changes to the project. the paper also includes a discussion of plans for expansion of modules and practices for keeping content current.
polymerase_chain_reaction	disease has an effect on crop yields, causing significant losses. as the worldwide demand for agricultural products increases, there is a need to pursue the development of new methods to protect crops from disease. one mechanism of plant protection is through the activation of the plant immune system. by exogenous application, 'plant activator molecules' with elicitor properties can be used to activate the plant immune system. these defence-inducing molecules represent a powerful and often environmentally friendly tool to fight pathogens. we show that the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (dca) induces defence in arabidopsis and reduces the proliferation of two bacterial phytopathogens: erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. we describe the global defence response triggered by this new plant activator in arabidopsis at the transcriptional level. several induced genes were selected for further analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. we describe the kinetics of their induction and show that abiotic stress, such as moderate drought or nitrogen limitation, does not impede dca induction of defence. finally, we investigate the role in the activation of defence by this bile acid of the salicylic acid biosynthesis gene sid2, of the receptor-like kinase family genes wak1-3 and of the nadph oxidase-encoding rbohd gene. altogether, we show that dca constitutes a promising molecule for plant protection which can induce complementary lines of defence, such as callose deposition, reactive oxygen species accumulation and the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling pathways.
immunology	background: tick-borne diseases greatly impact human and animal health worldwide, and vaccines are an environmentally friendly alternative to acaricides for their control. recent results have suggested that aquaporin (aqp) water channels have a key function during tick feeding and development, and constitute good candidate antigens for the control of tick infestations. methods: here we describe the effect of vaccination with the ixodes ricinus aqp1 (iraqp) and a tick aqp conserved region (coaqp) on i. ricinus tick larval mortality, feeding and molting. results: we demonstrated that vaccination with iraqp and coaqp had an efficacy of 32% and 80%, respectively on the control of i. ricinus larvae by considering the cumulative effect on reducing tick survival and molting. conclusions: the effect of the aqp vaccines on larval survival and molting is essential to reduce tick infestations, and extended previous results on the effect of r. microplus aqp1 on the control of cattle tick infestations. these results supports that aqp, and particularly coaqp, might be a candidate protective antigen for the control of different tick species.

northern_blotting	micrornas (mirs) have emerged as important clinical biomarkers with both diagnostic and prognostic value for relevant diseases, such as cancer. mirs pose unique challenges for detection and are currently detected by northern blotting, real-time pcr, and microarray techniques. these expensive, complicated, and time-consuming techniques are not feasible for on-site mir determination. in this study, amperometric magnetobiosensors involving rna-binding viral protein p19 as a selective biorecognition element were developed for mir quantification. the p19-based magnetosensors were able to detect 0.4 fmol of a synthetic target and endogenous mir-21 (selected as a model for its role in a wide variety of cancers) in only 2 h in total rna extracted from cancer cells and human breast-tumor specimens without pcr amplification and sample preprocessing. these results open up formidable perspectives for the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers and for drug-discovery programs.
hydraulics	drill stem vibration may cause drilling inefficiencies and often leads to non-productive time. drill stem vibration analysis is performed to prevent and identify rpm values that may cause damaging standing waves in the drill stem. however, different models and assumptions give different vibration results. one simplification commonly done is excluding drilling fluids. this paper investigates the effect of including drilling hydraulics and the dynamic pressure on drill stem vibrations. the model assumes the drill stem is acting as a euler bernoulli beam and was discretized using a finite element formulation. two fluid rheological models, herschel bulkley and power law, were used to determine the uncoupled dynamic pressure drop across the drill stem. the results show that including the dynamic pressure in the drill stem vibration model causes the critical rotational speeds to change as much as 32% (i.e. 59 rpm). as expected, axial and torsional vibrations are not affected, while lateral vibration changes significantly when the ratio of the wellbore diameter to the drill stem outside diameter is below 1.25, with a narrow total drill bit flow area, or when operating at high flow rates. therefore, when creating rpm road maps to avoid vibrations while drilling, the contribution of the dynamic pressure should be included.

northern_blotting	abiotic stresses, especially salinity and drought, are major limiting factors for plant growth and crop productivity. in an attempt to develop salt and drought tolerant tomato, a dna cassette containing tobacco osmotin gene driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter was transferred to tomato (solanum lycopersicum) via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. putative t0 transgenic plants were screened by pcr analysis. the selected transformants were evaluated for salt and drought stress tolerance by physiological analysis at t1 and t2 generations. integration of the osmotin gene in transgenic t1 plants was verified by southern blot hybridization. transgenic expression of the osmotin gene was verified by rt-pcr and northern blotting in t1 plants. t1 progenies from both transformed and untransformed plants were tested for salt and drought tolerance by subjecting them to different levels of nacl stress and by withholding water supply, respectively. results from different physiological tests demonstrated enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses in transgenic plants harboring the osmotin gene as compared to the wild-type plants. the transgenic lines showed significantly higher relative water content, chlorophyll content, proline content, and leaf expansion than the wild-type plants under stress conditions. the present investigation clearly shows that overexpression of osmotin gene enhances salt and drought stress tolerance in transgenic tomato plants.
enzymology	although developments in liquid dispensers have made the use of 1536-well plates for high-throughput screening (hts) standard, there is still a gap in dispenser technology for performing matrix experiments with several components. experiments such as those performed during assay development and enzymological studies are therefore still performed by manual pipetting in lower-density plates. we have evaluated a new dispenser, the certus liquid dispenser (gyger fluidics gmbh, switzerland), that is capable of flexible dispensing in 1536-well format, with a dead volume of less than 200 mu l. taking advantage of the precision of the dispenser for volumes down to 50 nl, we have created concentration gradients on plates by dispensing different volumes of reagent and then backfilling with buffer. using this method and the flexibility of the dispenser software, we have performed several multidimensional experiments varying two to three components, including an assay development for an hts, a mode of inhibition study, and a cofactor optimization, in which we determined 32 k-m values. overall, the flexibility of the plate layout for multiple components, the accuracy to dispense volumes ranging 2 log orders, and minimal reagent usage enable this dispenser for complex biochemical experiments.
northern_blotting	the effect of frequent protein malnutrition on liver function has not been intensively examined. thus, the effects of alternating 5 days of a protein and amino acid-free diet followed by 5 days of a complete diet repeated three times (3 pfd-cd) on female mouse liver were examined. the expression of carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), fatty acid synthase (fas), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and glutathione s-transferase p1 (gstp1) in liver were assessed by proteomics, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. the activities of liver gsts, glutathione reductase (gr) and catalase (cat), as well as serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (sgot) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (sgpt) were also tested. additionally, oxidative damage was examined by measuring of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation. liver histology was examined by light and electron microscopy. compared with control mice, 3 pfd-cd increased the content of fas protein (+90%) and fas mrna (+30%), while the levels of caiii and caiii mrnas were decreased (-48% and -64%, respectively). in addition, 3 pfd-cd did not significantly change the content of gstp1 but produced an increase in its mrna level (+20%), while it decreased the activities of both cat (-66%) and gsts (-26%). after 3 pfd-cd, liver protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation were increased by +55% and +95%, respectively. in serum, 3 pfd-cd increased the activities of both sgot (+30%) and sgpt (+61%). in addition, 3 pfd-cd showed a histological pattern characteristic of hepatic damage. all together, these data suggest that frequent dietary amino acid deprivation causes hepatic metabolic and ultrastructural changes in a fashion similar to precancerous or cancerous conditions.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective. to determine the presence of human papillomavirus (hpv) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in the larynx without the bias of other sublocations, and to describe the different serotypes of hpv and their impact on overall and disease-free survival after 10-year follow-up. study design. retrospective case series with chart review of ear, nose, and throat oncologic database. setting. academic tertiary care hospital. subjects. a total of 123 samples of larynx squamous cell carcinoma were included, only from the glottis and treated only with surgery between 1977 and 2005. methods. dna extraction was carried out by polymerase chain reaction, and subsequent visualization was performed in low-density arrays. results were compared with histologic, clinicopathologic, and survival parameters, with a 10-year follow-up. results. hpv dna was detected in 22.76% (n = 28) of the samples. eleven genotypes were detected, 2 of which had never been described in the larynx (hpv43 and hpv62). no increasing trend of hpv was observed over time. hpv presence did not correlate with better survival during the follow-up. smoking was proven as an independent factor in relation to the presence of hpv. conclusion. hpv may represent a notable factor in the development of a subset of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma without significant influence on overall and disease-free survival. more studies, including oncogene transcription proteins, would be necessary to draw more relevant conclusions about the relevance of hpv infection in the larynx.
cell_biology	satellite cells, which are resident in hypoxic niches in the tissue. hypoxia has been recognized as a key factor to maintain stem cells in an undifferentiated state. herein we report that hypoxia plays a fundamental role also in activating myogenesis. in particular, we found that the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1 alpha under hypoxia, in murine skeletal myoblasts, leads to activation of myod through the noncanonical wnt/beta-catenin pathway. moreover, chemical inhibition of hif-1 alpha activity significantly reduces differentiation, thus confirming its crucial role in the process. furthermore, hypoxia-preconditioned myoblasts, once induced to differentiate under normoxic conditions, tend to form hypertrophic myotubes. these results support the notion that hypoxia plays a pivotal role in activating the regeneration process by directly inducing myogenesis through hif-1 alpha. although preliminary, these findings may suggest new perspective for novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of several muscle diseases.-cirillo, f., resmini, g., ghiroldi, a., piccoli, m., bergante, s., tettamanti, g., anastasia, l. activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha promotes myogenesis through the noncanonical wnt pathway, leading to hypertrophic myotubes.
immunology	rheumatic heart disease represents a leading cause of mortality caused by group a streptococcus (gas) infections transmitted through the respiratory route. although gas infections can be treated with antibiotics these are often inadequate. an efficacious gas vaccine holds more promise, with intranasal vaccination especially attractive, as it mimics the natural route of infections and should be able to induce mucosal iga and systemic igg immunity. nanoparticles were prepared by either encapsulating or coating lipopeptide-based vaccine candidate (lcp-1) on the surface of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga). in vitro study showed that encapsulation of lcp-1 vaccine into nanoparticles improved uptake and maturations of antigen-presenting cells. the immunogenicity of lipopeptide incorporated plga-based nanoparticles was compared with peptides co-administered with mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin b in mice upon intranasal administration. higher levels of j14-specific salivary mucosal iga and systemic antibody igg titres were observed for groups immunized with encapsulated lcp-1 compared to lcp-1 coated nanoparticles or free lcp-1. systemic antibodies obtained from lcp-1 encapsulated plga nps inhibited the growth of bacteria in six different gas strains. our results show that plga-based lipopeptide delivery is a promising approach for rational design of a simple, effective and patient friendly intranasal gas vaccine resulting in mucosal iga response.

southern_blotting	chilli, an important commercial crop, is recalcitrant to in vitro regeneration. in the present study, an attempt has been made to optimize the in vitro regeneration of two chilli local cultivars, viz., g4 and lca334, and transform g4 with a transcription factor dreb1a under the control of a desiccation inducible promoter rd29a, known to impart desiccation tolerance, using binary vector pcambia 2301. different phytohormones and their concentrations in ms medium were evaluated for in vitro response; 0.25 mg l-1 zeatin and 2 mg l-1 phenyl acetic acid (paa) supported the highest regeneration rate (37.86%). among the explants, cotyledonary leaf exhibited a higher (51%) regeneration response compared to that of hypocotyls (24.73%), and genotype g4 had better (33.80%) regeneration rate compared to lca334. rooting of the shoots was the highest in ms medium with 2 mg l-1 indole butyric acid (iba) compared to other hormones. the presence of transgene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and southern blotting. the acclimatized transformants were grown in pots and screened for drought tolerance. some of the transformants showed improved tolerance to drought by lower wilting compared to the control plants. the transformation and regeneration protocol described in the present study may help in optimization of transformation of chilli for agronomic traits of interest.
northern_blotting	shmirs are pri-mirna-based rna interference triggers from which exogenous sirnas are expressed in cells to silence target genes. these reagents are very promising tools in rnai in vivo applications due to their good activity profile and lower toxicity than observed for other vector-based reagents such as shrnas. in this study, using high-resolution northern blotting and small rna sequencing, we investigated the precision with which rnases drosha and dicer process shmirs. the fidelity of sirna release from the commonly used pri-mirna shuttles was found to depend on both the sirna insert and the pri-mir scaffold. then, we searched for specific factors that may affect the precision of sirna release and found that both the structural features of shmir hairpins and the nucleotide sequence at drosha and dicer processing sites contribute to cleavage site selection and cleavage precision. an analysis of multiple shrna intermediates generated from several reagents revealed the complexity of shmir processing by drosha and demonstrated that dicer selects substrates for further processing. aside from providing new basic knowledge regarding the specificity of nucleases involved in mirna biogenesis, our results facilitate the rational design of more efficient genetic reagents for rnai technology.

manufacturing_engineering	current product lifecycle management systems (plm) have concentrated on product design, not on manufacturing engineering with its development of e.g. material flows and layouts. this paper proposes an approach to describe how to represent the main required manufacturing process data using ontologies together with generic data standards. this approach makes it possible to develop translations between different software, and also providing users with the meaning of different concepts. it contributes to an efficient management of manufacturing information, with a focus on the material flow information as used in discrete event simulation - des.
southern_blotting	recent findings have shown that amniotic fluid (af) could be a putative new source of multipotent stem cells (sc). we investigated whether these human sc could efficiently differentiate into myogenic lineage in vitro and integrate in vivo skeletal muscle in severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mice. c/kit immunomagnetic-sorted af (af c/kit+) sc were characterized by immunocytochemistry and southern blotting for myogenic markers (desmin, myod). in vitro, af c/kit+ sc phenotypic conversion into myogenic cells was assayed by myogenic-specific induction media. af c/kit+ sc without ex vivo manipulation were transplanted into the tibialis anterior (ta) of (scid) mice. acquisition of a myogenic-like phenotype (desmin, myod) in af c/kit+ sc was observed after culture in myogenic-specific induction media. in vivo, transplanted af c/kit+ sc showed an engraftment in the skeletal muscle of scid mice, but with unexpected tubular glandular tissue-like differentiation. importantly, no immuno-rejection, inflammatory response or tumorigenicity of these cells was found. within these experimental conditions, af c/kit+ sc were able to differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro, but not in vivo after their transplantation into the skeletal muscle of scid mice. because af c/kit+ sc survived and differentiated into tubular gland-like cells after their transplantation in the ta, an ex vivo engagement in myogenic pathway prior their transplantation could favor their differentiation into myogenic cells in vivo.
genetics	connectivity between populations influences both their dynamics and the genetic structuring of species. in this study, we explored connectivity patterns of a marine species with long-distance dispersal, the edible common sea urchin paracentrotus lividus, focusing mainly on the adriatic-ionian basins (central mediterranean). we applied a multidisciplinary approach integrating population genomics, based on 1,122 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) obtained from 2b-rad in 275 samples, with lagrangian simulations performed with a biophysical model of larval dispersal. we detected genetic homogeneity among eight population samples collected in the focal adriatic-ionian area, whereas weak but significant differentiation was found with respect to two samples from the western mediterranean (france and tunisia). this result was not affected by the few putative outlier loci identified in our dataset. lagrangian simulations found a significant potential for larval exchange among the eight adriatic-ionian locations, supporting the hypothesis of connectivity of p.lividus populations in this area. a peculiar pattern emerged from the comparison of our results with those obtained from published p.lividus cytochrome b (cytb) sequences, the latter revealing genetic differentiation in the same geographic area despite a smaller sample size and a lower power to detect differences. the comparison with studies conducted using nuclear markers on other species with similar pelagic larval durations in the same adriatic-ionian locations indicates species-specific differences in genetic connectivity patterns and warns against generalizing single-species results to the entire community of rocky shore habitats.
immunology	the social and economic burden of allergic rhinitis (ar) is increasing, with significant effects on the quality of life of patients suffering from ar. therefore, physicians require evidence-based guidelines regarding the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and proper management management of patients with ar. the korean academy of asthma, allergy and clinical immunology developed new clinical guidelines for the appropriate management of ar, especially in korean patients. for the core questions (i.e. questions that most practitioners were curious about), several experts in the field of allergology, pediatrics, and otorhinolaryngology developed a set of practical guidelines based on a systematic review of the literature. furthermore, we determined the level of evidence associated with the recommendations for each answer. in this article, we suggest 15 answers for core questions about the medical treatment of ar.
enzymology	to establish a non-radioactive, cell-free detection system for protein n-myristoylation, metabolic labeling in a cell-free protein synthesis system using bioorthogonal myristic acid analogues was performed. after cu(i)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (cuaac) with a biotin tag, the tagged proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and blotted on a polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) membrane, and then protein n-myristoylation was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) using horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated streptavidin. the results showed that metabolic labeling in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system using an azide analogue of myristic acid followed by cuaac with alkynyl biotin was the most effective strategy for cell-free detection of protein n-myristoylation. to determine whether the newly developed detection method can be applied for the detection of novel n-myristoylated proteins from complementary dna (cdna) resources, four candidate cdna clones were selected from a human cdna resource and their susceptibility to protein n-myristoylation was evaluated using the newly developed strategy. as a result, the products of three cdna clones were found to be novel n-myristoylated protein, and myristoylation-dependent specific intracellular localization was observed for two novel n-myristoylated proteins. thus, the metabolic labeling in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system using bioorthogonal azide analogue of myristic acid was an effective strategy to identify novel n-myristoylated proteins from cdna resources.

polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: phthalates, which are commonly used to render plastics into soft and flexible materials, have also been determined as developmental and reproductive toxicants in human and animals. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of mono-(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (mehp) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (dehp) oral administrations on maturation of mouse oocytes, apoptosis and gene transcription levels. materials and methods: in this experimental study, immature oocytes recovered from naval medical research institute (nmri) mouse strain (6-8 weeks), were divided into seven different experimental and control groups. control group oocytes were retrieved from mice that received only normal saline. the experimental groups i, ii or iii oocytes were retrieved from mice treated with 50, 100 or 200 mu l dehp (2.56 mu m) solution, respectively. the experimental groups iv, v or vi oocytes were retrieved from mouse exposed to 50, 100 or 200 mu l mehp (2.56 mu m) solution, respectively. fertilization and embryonic development were carried out in omm and t6 medium. apoptosis was assessed by annexin v-fitc/dead cell apoptosis kit, with pi staining. in addition, the mrna levels of pou5f1, ccna1 and asah1 were examined in oocytes. finally, mouse embryo at early blastocyst stage was stained with acridine-orange (ao) and ethidium-bromide (eb), in order to access their viability. results: the proportion of oocytes that progressed up to metaphase ii (mii) and 2-cells embryo formation stage was significantly decreased by exposure to mehp or dehp, in a dose-dependent manner. annexin v and pi positive oocytes showed greater quantity in the treated mice than control. quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) revealed that expression levels of pou5f1, asah1 and ccna1 were significantly lower in the treated mouse oocytes than control. the total cell count for blastocyst developed from the treated mouse oocytes was lower than the controls. conclusion: these results indicate that oral administration of mehp and dehp could negatively affect mouse oocyte meiotic maturation and development in vivo, suggesting that phthalates could be risk factors for mammalians' reproductive health. additionally, phthalate-induced changes in pou5f1, asah1 and ccna1 transcription level could explain in part, the reduced developmental ability of mouse-treated oocytes.
computer-aided_design	this study investigates the retention load (rl) between zro2 primary crowns and secondary polyetheretherketone (peek) crowns made by different fabrication methods with three different tapers. standardized primary zro2 crowns were fabricated with three different tapers: 0 degrees, 1 degrees, and 2 degrees (n = 10/group). ten secondary crowns were fabricated (i) milled from brecam biohpp blanks (pm); (ii) pressed from industrially fabricated peek pellets (pp) (biohpp pellet); or (iii) pressed from granular peek (pg) (biohpp granulat). one calibrated operator adjusted all crowns. in total, the rl of 90 secondary crowns were measured in pull-off tests at 50 mm/min, and each specimen was tested 20 times. two- and one-way anovas followed by a scheff 's post-hoc test were used for data analysis (p < 0.05). within crowns with a 0 degrees taper, the pp group showed significantly higher retention load values compared with the other groups. among the 1 degrees taper, the pm group presented significantly lower retention loads than the pp group. however, the pressing type had no impact on the results. within the 2 degrees taper, the fabrication method had no influence on the rl. within the pm group, the 2 degrees taper showed significantly higher retention load compared with the 1 ffi taper. the taper with 0 degrees was in the same range value as the 1 degrees and 2 degrees tapers. no impact of the taper on the retention value was observed between the pp groups. within the pg groups, the 0 ffi taper presented significantly lower rl than the 1 degrees taper, whereas the 2 degrees taper showed no differences. the fabrication method of the secondary peek crowns and taper angles showed no consistent effect within all tested groups.
northern_blotting	successful detection of very small rnas (tiny rna, similar to 14 nt in length) by northern blotting is dependent on improved northern blot protocols that combine chemical crosslinking of rna with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)- carbodiimide (edc) to positively charged membranes, the use of native polyacrylamide gels, and the development of highly sensitive and specific probes modified with locked nucleic acids (lna). in this protocol, we show that northern blot detection of tiny rnas with 5'-digoxigenin-labeled dna/lna mixmer probes is a highly sensitive and specific method and, in our hands, more sensitive than using a corresponding dna/lna mixmer probe with a 5'-p-32-end label.
southern_blotting	several bacterial isolates were recovered from surface-sterilized root nodules of arachis hypogaea l. (peanut) plants growing in soils from cordoba, argentina. the 16s rdna sequences of seven fast-growing strains were obtained and the phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates belonged to the phylum proteobacteria, class gammaproteobacteria, and included pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., and klebsiella spp. after storage, these strains became unable to induce nodule formation in arachis hypogaea l. plants, but they enhanced plant yield. when the isolates were co-inoculated with an infective bradyrhizobium strain, they were even found colonizing pre-formed nodules. analysis of symbiotic genes showed that the nifh gene was only detected for the klebsiella-like isolates and the nodc gene could not be amplified by pcr or be detected by southern blotting in any of the isolates. the results obtained support the idea that these isolates are opportunistic bacteria able to colonize nodules induced by rhizobia.

northern_blotting	this study presents the isolation and characterization of a novel nonsymbiotic hb gene from sessile oak (quercus petraea) seedlings, herein designated qphb1. the cellular and tissue expression of qphb1 was analysed by northern blotting and in situ hybridization. the encoded protein was predicted to consist of 161 amino acid residues, and shares 71 and 51% amino acid sequence identity with the arabidopsis class 1 and 2 nonsymbiotic hb, respectively. northern blot analysis revealed that qphb1 was strongly expressed in roots. spatial expression analysis of qphb1 in the root apical region of sessile oak by in situ hybridization indicated that transcripts were mostly abundant in protoxylem cell initials, some cortical cells and the protoderm. in addition, when comparing the expression profile of qphb1 in sessile and pedunculate oak (quercus robur), two species with contrasted hypoxia tolerance, the transcript level of qphb1 rose early in the most flood-tolerant species, pedunculate oak, during root submergence. the spatial-temporal expression of qphb1 suggests that this gene could participate in perception and signalling during hypoxia.
thermodynamics	recent experimental work has shown that variations in the confinement of n-butane at bronsted acid sites due to changes in zeolite framework structure strongly affect the apparent and intrinsic enthalpy and entropy of activation for cracking and dehydrogenation. quantum chemical calculations have provided good estimates of the intrinsic enthalpies and entropies of activation extracted from experimental rate data for mfi, but extending these calculations to less confining zeolites has proven challenging, particularly for activation entropies. herein, we report our efforts to develop a theoretical model for the cracking and dehydrogenation of n-butane occurring in a series of zeolites containing 10-ring channels and differing in cavity size (ton, fer, svr, mfi, mel, stf, and mww). we combine a qm/mm approach to calculate intrinsic and apparent activation parameters, with thermal corrections to the apparent barriers obtained from configurational-bias monte carlo simulations, to account for configurational contributions due to global motions of the transition state. we obtain good agreement between theory and experiment for all activation parameters for central cracking in all zeolites. for terminal cracking and dehydrogenation, good agreement between theory and experiment is found only at the highest confinements. experimental activation parameters, especially those for dehydrogenation, tend to increase with decreasing confinement. this trend is not captured by the theoretical calculations, such that deviations between theory and experiment increase as confinement decreases. we propose that, because transition states for dehydrogenation are later than those for cracking, relative movements between the fragments produced in the reaction become increasingly important in the less confining zeolites.
strength_of_materials	polypropylene (pp)/1, 4-bis(3-tetradecylimidiazolium-1-yl) butane bromide (br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c-14-im]br) blends were prepared via melting blending,and then the structure and properties of the blend were characterised and tested. results of testing indicate that br[c-14 im] (ch2)(4) [c-14 im] br could have a heterogeneous nucleating effect in the pp matrix. moreover, pp was readily to form alpha-crystal in the pp crystallizing process with the help of br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br. xrd data show the crystallizing process of pp could be affected by br[c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br, and thus decreased the crystallinity of pp. dsc results show the melting point and the crystallization temperature of pp/br[c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br blends was close to that of neat pp, this maybe due to the good compatibility of pp to br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im] br with long alkyl chains. in addition, the presence of br [c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br could improve the antistatic properties of pp apparently, and the surface resistivity of the pp was decreased to 8.97 x 10(9) omega cm when the content of br[c(14)im](ch2)(4) [c(14)im]br in the blends was about 3 phr. as for the mechanical properties, the tensile strength decreased while the impact strength of materials presented the opposite results with br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br incorporated into it. dma results show the glass transition (t-g) of pp also decreases when 3 phr br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br exists in its matrix. therefore, br[c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br has the plasticized effect on the pp matrix in our experiments.
polymerase_chain_reaction	introducing an animal into a new location could be hazardous in the form of disease transmission, especially with respect to infections that are often overlooked. such introduced infectious agents, including parasitic ones, then pose potential danger to the native animal population. within the conservation program, the european bison was introduced into many european countries. however, this largest european herbivore was recognized as a new host for an invasive parasitic nematode, ashworthius sidemi, in poland in 1998. since then, the prevalence of this non-native parasite in poland has increased not only in bison but also in other wild ruminants. in 2011 five european bison individuals were transported from poland to the czech republic. in the current study, we examined the gastrointestinal tracts of two european bison and two red deer culled in the z. idlov game reserve. a. sidemi was identified in all investigated animals using both morphological and molecular methods; infection intensity was higher in bison than in deer. our findings represent the first record of this invasive parasite in european bison at the czech territory. the results of this study indicate changes in epidemiological patterns of ashworthius infections in the climatic condition of central europe as well as the need to verify the reliability of ashworthiosis intravital diagnostics. one can expect a. sidemi to spread gradually in the czech republic and colonize other native ruminant hosts.
northern_blotting	cholangiocarcinoma (cc) is an intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma with a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. sarcomatous change/epithelial mesenchymal transition (emt) of cc frequently leads to aggressive intrahepatic spread and metastasis. the aim of this study was to identify the genetic alterations and gene expression pattern that might be associated with the sarcomatous change in cc. previously, we established 4 human cc cell lines (sck, jck1, cho-ck, and choi-ck). in the present study, we characterized a typical sarcomatoid phenotype of sck, and classified the other cell lines according to tumor cell differentiation (a poorly differentiated jck, a moderately differentiated cho-ck, and a well differentiated choi-ck cells), both morphologically and immunocytologically. we further analyzed the genetic alterations of two tumor suppressor genes (p53 and fhit) and the expression of fas/fasl gene, well known cc-related receptor and its ligand, in these four cc cell lines. the deletion mutation of p53 was found in the sarcomatoid sck cells. these cells expressed much less fas/fasl mrnas than did the other ordinary cc cells. we further characterize the gene expression pattern that is involved in the sarcomatous progression of cc, using cdna microarrays that contained 18,688 genes. comparison of the expression patterns between the sarcomatoid sck cells and the differentiated choi-ck cells enabled us to identify 260 genes and 247 genes that were significantly over-expressed and under-expressed, respectively. northern blotting of the 14 randomly selected genes verified the microarray data, including the differential expressions of the lgals1, tgfbi, ces1, ldhb, uchl1, asph, vdac1, vil2, ccnd2, s100p, calb1, mal2, gpx1, and anxa8 mrnas. immunohistochemistry also revealed in part the differential expressions of these gene proteins. these results suggest that those genetic and gene expression alterations may be relevant to the sarcomatous change/emt in cc cells.
fluid_mechanics	purpose: the physiological flow dynamics within the valsalva sinuses, in terms of global and local parameters, are still not fully understood. this study attempts to identify the physiological conditions as closely as possible, and to give an explanation of the different and sometime contradictory results in literature. methods: an in vitro approach was implemented for testing porcine bio-prosthetic valves operating within different aortic root configurations. all tests were performed on a pulse duplicator, under physiological pressure and flow conditions. the fluid dynamics established in the various cases were analysed by means of 2d particle image velocimetry, and related with the achieved hydrodynamic performance. results: each configuration is associated with substantially different flow dynamics, which significantly affects the valve performance. the configuration most closely replicating healthy native anatomy was characterised by the best hemodynamic performance, and any mismatch in size and position between the valve and the root produced substantial modification of the fluid dynamics downstream of the valve, hindering the hydrodynamic performance of the system. the worst conditions were observed for a configuration characterised by the total absence of the valsalva sinuses. conclusion: this study provides an explanation for the different vortical structures described in the literature downstream of bioprosthetic valves, enlightening the experimental complications in valve testing. most importantly, the results clearly identify the fluid mechanisms promoted by the valsalva sinuses to enhance the ejection and closing phases, and this study exposes the importance of an optimal integration of the valve and root, to operate as a single system.

enzymology	staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that relies on a large repertoire of secreted and cell wall-associated proteins for pathogenesis. consequently, the ability of the organism to cause disease is absolutely dependent on its ability to synthesize and successfully secrete these proteins. in this study, we investigate the role of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (ppiases) on the activity of the s. aureus secreted virulence factor nuclease (nuc). we identify a staphylococcal cyclophilin-type ppiase (ppib) that is required for optimal activity of nuc. disruption of ppib results in decreased nuclease activity in culture supernatants; however, the levels of nuc protein are not altered, suggesting that the decrease in activity results from misfolding of nuc in the absence of ppib. we go on to demonstrate that ppib exhibits ppiase activity in vitro, is localized to the bacterial cytosol, and directly interacts with nuc in vitro to accelerate the rate of nuc refolding. finally, we demonstrate an additional role for ppib in s. aureus hemolysis and demonstrate that the s. aureus parvulin-type ppiase prsa also plays a role in the activity of secreted virulence factors. the deletion of prsa leads to a decrease in secreted protease and phospholipase activity, similar to that observed in other gram-positive pathogens. together, these results demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that ppiases play an important role in the secretion of virulence factors in s. aureus. importance staphylococcus aureus is a highly dangerous bacterial pathogen capable of causing a variety of infections throughout the human body. the ability of s. aureus to cause disease is largely due to an extensive repertoire of secreted and cell wall-associated proteins, including adhesins, toxins, exoenzymes, and superantigens. these virulence factors, once produced, are typically transported across the cell membrane by the secretory (sec) system in a denatured state. consequently, once outside the cell, they must refold into their active form. this step often requires the assistance of bacterial folding proteins, such as ppiases. in this work, we investigate the role of ppiases in s. aureus and uncover a cyclophilin-type enzyme that assists in the folding/refolding of staphylococcal nuclease.
machine_design	reliability integration into tillage machine design process is a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of classical design approaches and to achieve designs with a required reliability level. furthermore, design optimization of soil tillage equipments under uncertainty seeks to design structures which should be both economic and reliable. the originality of this research is to develop an efficient methodology that controls the reliability levels for complex statistical distribution cases of random tillage forces. this developed strategy is based on design sensitivity concepts in order to determine the influence of each random parameter. the application of this method consists in taking into account the uncertainties on the soil tillage forces. the tillage forces are calculated in accordance with analytical model of mckyes and ali with some modifications to include the effect of both soil-metal adhesion and tool speed. the different developments and applications show the importance of the developed method to improve the performance of the soil tillage equipments considering both random geometry and loading parameters. the developed method so-called osf (optimum safety factor) can satisfy a required reliability level without additional computing time relative to the deterministic design optimization study. since the agricultural equipment parameters are extremely nonlinear, we extended the osf approach to several nonlinear probabilistic distributions such as lognormal, uniform, weibull and gumbel probabilistic distribution laws.

manufacturing_engineering	nowadays, mobility grants for undergraduate students are leading to increase the number of foreign students enrolled in many universities. normally, european students receive an erasmus grant provided by the european commission, which contributes to exchange students between european countries. many times, the receiving (host) university does not offer the chance to attend lectures in english, and the same goes for labs. usually, foreign students just have individual tutorial sessions and assessments in english. in the present paper we show a methodology to conduct lab sessions when teaching a multilingual group of engineering students. the group under consideration consists of spanish students and some non-spanish speaking students. lab lectures are taught in spanish, but the methodology proposed allows teaching the aforementioned foreign students. this methodology is based on performing a previous homework, which will prepare students to fulfill successfully laboratory activities. video lessons have been recorded in order to show step by step how to perform each lab, and english subtitles have been added. videos are enough well explained so that students that demonstrate a basic level of english can easily understand the activities proposed. several videos have been recorded and some of them included in this work to illustrate the teaching process. these videos show typical practice lessons taught in various subjects at the mechanical faculty of the university of jaen: thermodynamics, metrology and manufacturing engineering. one of the reasons why this methodology has been proposed is to unify the bilingual teaching methodology for several subjects. another one is related to students whose mother tongue is not english. currently, those students must acquire skills that allow them to work in a multilingual group. so we will propose activities to integrate spanish and foreign students. finally an opinion survey is developed in order to determine improvements in the learning process.
immunology	a great part of our knowledge on mammalian immunology has been established in laboratory settings. the use of inbred mouse strains enabled controlled studies of immune cell and molecule functions in defined settings. these studies were usually performed in specific-pathogen free (spf) environments providing standardized conditions. in contrast, mammalians including humans living in their natural habitat are continuously facing pathogen encounters throughout their life. the influences of environmental conditions on the signatures of the immune system and on experimental outcomes are yet not well defined. thus, the transferability of results obtained in current experimental systems to the physiological human situation has always been a matter of debate. studies elucidating the diversity of wild immunology imprintings in detail and comparing it with those of clean lab mice are sparse. here, we applied multidimensional mass cytometry to dissect phenotypic and functional differences between distinct groups of laboratory and pet shop mice as a source for wild mice. for this purpose, we developed a 31-antibody panel for murine leukocyte subsets identification and a 35-antibody panel assessing various cytokines. established murine leukocyte populations were easily identified and diverse immune signatures indicative of numerous pathogen encounters were classified particularly in pet shop mice and to a lesser extent in quarantine and non-spf mice as compared to spf mice. in addition, unsupervised analysis identified distinct clusters that associated strongly with the degree of pathogenic priming, including increased frequencies of activated nk cells and antigen-experienced b- and t-cell subsets. our study unravels the complexity of immune signatures altered under physiological pathogen challenges and highlights the importance of carefully adapting laboratory settings for immunological studies in mice, including drug and therapy testing.

genetics	genetic counselors are trained health care professionals who effectively integrate both psychosocial counseling and information-giving into their practice. preparing genetic counseling students for clinical practice is a challenging task, particularly when helping them develop effective and active counseling skills. resistance to incorporating these skills may stem from decreased confidence, fear of causing harm or a lack of clarity of psycho-social goals. the author reflects on the personal challenges experienced in teaching genetic counselling students to work with psychological and social complexity, and proposes a genetic counseling adaptation continuum model and methodology to guide students in the use of advanced counseling skills.
southern_blotting	three putative terpenoid udp-glycosyltransferase (ugt) genes, designated csugt1, csugt2, and csugt3, were isolated and characterized in 'valencia' sweet orange (citrus sinensis l. osbeck). csugt1 consisted of 1493 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 492 amino acids, csugt2 consisted of 1727 nucleotides encoding 504 amino acids, and csugt3 consisted of 1705 nucleotides encoding 468 amino acids. csugt3 had a 145 bp intron at 730-874, whereas csugt1 and csugt2 had none. the three deduced glycosyltransferase proteins had a highly conserved plant secondary product glycosyltransferase motif in the c terminus. phylogenetic analysis showed that csugt1 and csugt3 were classified into group l of glycosyltransferase family 1, and csugt2 was classified into group d. through southern blotting analysis, csugt1 was found to have two copies in the sweet orange genome, whereas csugt2 and csugt3 had at least seven and nine copies, respectively. csugt1, csugt2, and csugt3 were constitutively expressed in leaf, flower, and fruit tissues. the results facilitate further investigation of the function of terpenoid glycosyltransferases in citrus and the biosynthesis of terpenoid glycosides in vitro.
internal_combustion_engine	the experimental study was conducted on single cylinder, forced air cooled hydrogen fuelled spark ignition (si) generator set, which was converted from gasoline fuelled generator set with rated power 2.1 kva at 3000 rpm. the study was carried out at various compression ratios (4.5:1, 6.5:1 (base) and 7.2:1), spark timings (2-20 degrees ca before top dead centre (btdc)) and exhaust gas recirculation (egr) up to 25% by volume. furthermore, the experimental tests were conducted on the engine with varied start of gas injection (501) at various compression ratios in order to find the backfire limiting start of injection (bfl-soi). the results indicated that engine operation at higher compression ratio improved the brake thermal efficiency and reduced the backfire occurrence as residual gas fraction decreased with increased compression ratio. however, nox emission increased with increased compression ratio. in order to reduce the nox emission at source level, the engine was operated with retarded spark timings and different egr percentage. the relative nox emission decreased up to 10% with the spark time retarding of 2 degrees ca btdc from maximum brake torque (mbt) whereas it decreased about 57% with 25% by volume egr. the delay in gas injection could reduce the chance of backfire occurrence and the bfl-soi decreased with increased compression ratio. a notable point emerged from this study is that in hydrogen fuelled spark ignition engine the spark time retarding is not a suitable strategy for nox emission reduction whereas the egr at the optimum level (20%) is a better strategy that could reduce the nox emission up to 50% as compared to base hydrogen engine without egr. copyright 2016, hydrogen energy publications, llc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
thermodynamics	polyacrylonitrile fibers (panf) covalently modified with lysine (pan-lys) was facilely synthesized and carefully characterized. the critical factors affecting u(vi) adsorption from aqueous solution were exploited, such as initial ph, contact time, concentration and temperature. the adsorption process is strongly dependent on solution ph. with excellent adsorption capacity and high affinity toward u(vi), the process for u(vi) is extremely rapid and the equilibrium can be reached within 20 min. the thermodynamics and kinetics were strictly evaluated. in addition, the hypothetical adsorption mechanisms were proposed. moreover, the adsorption behavior at low concentrations (3-30 mu g l-1) in simulated seawater was also investigated. therefore, pan-lys can be potentially utilized for the efficient removal of u(vi) from seawater.

machine_design	inspired by the matrix-based methods used in feature extraction and selection, one matrix-pattern-oriented classification framework has been designed in our previous work and demonstrated to utilize one matrix pattern itself more effectively to improve the classification performance in practice. however, this matrix-based framework neglects the prior structural information of the whole input space that is made up of all the matrix patterns. this paper aims to overcome such flaw through taking advantage of one structure learning method named alternative robust local embedding (arle). as a result, a new regularization term r-gl is designed, expected to simultaneously represent the globality and the locality of the whole data domain, further boosting the existing matrix-based classification method. to our knowledge, it is the first trial to introduce both the globality and the locality of the whole data space into the matrixized classifier design. in order to validate the proposed approach, the designed rgi is applied into the previous work matrix-pattern-oriented ho-kashyap classifier (matmhks) to construct a new globalized and localized matmhks named glmatmhks. the experimental results on a broad range of data validate that glmatmhks not only inherits the advantages of the matrixized learning, but also uses the prior structural information more reasonably to guide the classification machine design.

genetics	innovations in clinical genetics have increased diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of inherited genetic conditions (igcs). this has led to an increased number of families seeking genetic testing and / or genetic counselling and increased the clinical load for genetic counsellors (gcs). keeping pace with biomedical discoveries, interventions are required to support families to understand, communicate and cope with their inherited genetic condition. the socio-psychological research in genomics (spring) collaborative have developed a new intervention, based on multi-family discussion groups (mfdgs), to support families affected by igcs and train gcs in its delivery. a potential challenge to implementing the intervention was whether gcs were willing and able to undergo the training to deliver the mfdg. in analysing three multi-perspective interviews with gcs, this paper evaluates the training received. findings suggests that mfdgs are a potential valuable resource in supporting families to communicate genetic risk information and can enhance family function and emotional well-being. furthermore, we demonstrate that it is feasible to train gcs in the delivery of the intervention and that it has the potential to be integrated into clinical practice. its longer term implementation into routine clinical practice however relies on changes in both organisation of clinical genetics services and genetic counsellors' professional development.
molecular_biology	the present study focuses on cryptosporidium infections of foals in brazil. a total of 92 animals of different breeds from 11 farms in the vicinity of aracatuba in the state of sao paulo, were examined. according to pcr targeting the 18s rrna gene, cryptosporidium sp. dna was detected in 21.7% (20/92) of foals. good quality 18s rrna, actin, hsp70 and gp60 genes npcr amplicons were obtained from five fecal samples. pcr amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the gp60 sporozoite surface glycoprotein gene revealed c parvum genotypes iiaal8g3r1, liaal5g2r1. interestingly, we also detected in two foals a gp60 genotype related to the human parasite c. hominis.

materials_engineering	it is increasingly common to encounter materials researchers engaged in the collaborative analysis and transformation of large-scale scientific data over extended periods of time. a scalable system for managing, tracing, exploring and communicating the analysis of diverse scientific data is required for these researchers. nowadays dataspaces systems offer a pay-as-you-go approach to data management, which offer services on the data in place, without losing the context surrounding the data. thus, we define a model and architecture for a virtual dataspaces (vds) capable of addressing this requirement. the automatic construction process of the virtual dataspaces model (vdm) is described in detail for effectively organising multi-source and heterogeneous data resources. furthermore, the dynamic evolution algorithm of vds is analysed and designed for timely tracking of the life cycle of the data resources. such a system could bring increases facilitating discovery, understanding and sharing of both scientific data resources. an application case in the field of materials engineering is described to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

fluid_mechanics	a multi-pump, multi-piston power take-off wave energy converter ((mppto)-p-2 wec) has been proposed for use with a novel renewable energy harvester termed the ocean grazer. the (mppto)-p-2 wec utilizes wave motion to pump via buoys connected to pistons working fluid within a closed circuit and store it as potential energy that can be converted to electricity via turbines. this paper introduces the mechanical design and model-based performance prediction of a single-piston pump that constitutes the basic building block for the (mppto)-p-2 wec. results provide preliminary validation of aqueous lubrication as a viable means of reducing friction and wear, suggesting that water-based hydraulic fluids can prohibit solid contact at the piston-cylinder interface while reducing volumetric leakage, and allowing for an estimation of the energy extraction efficiency for the mechanical pumping system. pending more thorough and extended tribological investigations using the methodology introduced in this paper, findings suggest that the overall system efficiency will be dictated by the hydrodynamics of the buoys actuating the pumping system.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the objective of this study was to assess the effect of dietary probiotics on rumen fermentation and the bacterial community in dairy calves. twelve holstein calves were randomly allocated to three treatments: a basal diet, the basal diet supplemented with lactobacillus plantarum gf103 (lb) or basal diet supplemented with a mixture of lactobacillus plantarum gf103 and bacillus subtilis b27 (lbs). a milk replacer was fed to calves from 8days of age. a starter and alfalfa hay was offered ad libitum from 21 and 28days of age, respectively, and the orts were weighted daily. the ruminal fluid was sampled at 56 and 83days of age to determine the rumen fermentation characteristics. the bacterial community was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and the number of certain bacteria was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. the ratio of total dry matter intake to average body wieght was higher in the control (p<0.05). the dgge fingerprint of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was affected by the blended probiotics at 83days of age. the number of ruminococcus albus was lower in the lb and lbs treatment (p<0.05). oral administration of the probiotics affected the rumen bacterial community and the numbers of cellulolytic bacteria decreased.
immunology	immunotherapy has recently emerged as the fourth pillar of cancer treatment, joining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. while early immunotherapies focused on accelerating t-cell activity, current immune-checkpoint inhibitors take the brakes off the anti-tumor immune responses. successful clinical trials with pd-1 monoclonal antibodies and other immune-checkpoint inhibitors have opened new avenues in cancer immunology. however, the failure of a large subset of cancer patients to respond to these new immunotherapies has led to intensified research on combination therapies and predictive biomarkers. here we summarize the development of pd-1-blockade immunotherapy and current issues in its clinical use.
fluid_mechanics	objectives-dissipative energy loss derived from vector flow mapping represents the viscous dissipation of turbulent blood flow. we aimed to determine the left ventricular (lv) energy loss in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). methods-patients with esrd and a preserved lv ejection fraction, who consisted of a group receiving peritoneal dialysis, a group receiving hemodialysis, and a group receiving preparation for dialysis initiation, were examined by echocardiography; a group of healthy control participants were examined as well. vector flow mapping analysis was then performed from the apical 4-chamber view to calculate the energy loss during diastole and systole in the left ventricle. results-conventional transthoracic echocardiography and lv energy loss calculations were successfully performed in 63 cases and 50 controls. the patients with esrd had significantly higher diastolic energy loss [median (interquartile range), 71.73 (46.08-106.75) versus 23.32 (17.17-29.26) mw/m; p < .001] and higher systolic energy loss [25.28 (19.03-33.93) versus 12.52 (9.35-16.47) mw/m; p < .001]. a significant difference in diastolic energy loss between the peritoneal dialysis and preparation groups was found [54.92 (39.28-89.94) versus 84.82 (62.58-171.4) mw/m; p = .04]. in patients with esrd, the log-transformed diastolic energy loss had a significant association with the peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (p=.011), peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity-to-peak early diastolic mitral annular flow velocity ratio (p = .001), lv mass index (p = .017), and heart rate (p = .003). conclusions-impaired blood flow efficiency was detected in patients with esrd by using dissipative energy loss derived from vector flow mapping. the energy loss value could be a novel parameter for evaluating the ventricular workload of uremic hearts in terms of fluid mechanics.
enzymology	fe-s cluster biogenesis is an essential pathway coordinated by a network of protein-protein interactions whose functions include desulfurase activity, substrate delivery, electron transfer and product transfer. in an effort to understand the intricacies of the pathway, we have developed an in vitro assay to follow the ferredoxin role in electron transfer during fe-s cluster assembly. previously, assays have relied upon the non-physiological reducing agents dithionite and dithiothreitol to assess function. we have addressed this shortcoming by using electron transfer between nadph and ferredoxin-nadp-reductase to reduce ferredoxin. our results show that this trio of electron transfer partners are sufficient to sustain the reaction in in vitro studies, albeit with a rate slower compared with dtt-mediated cluster assembly. we also show that, despite overlapping with the cyay protein in binding to iscs, fdx does not interfere with the inhibitory activity of this protein. we suggest explanations for these observations which have important consequences for understanding the mechanism of cluster formation. cofactor-dependent proteins: evolution, chemical diversity and bio-applications.

genetics	type 2 diabetes (t2d) is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). we have previously described that haploinsufficiency of nuclear receptor coactivator 5 (ncoa5) is a genetic defect linking glucose intolerance to hcc. here we report identification and characterization of a single nucleotide variation (t445a) in ncoa5, causing an amino acid thr to ala substitution, in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues derived from patients with concurrent hcc and t2d. by using tet-on inducible expression cells, we show that ectopic expression of ncoa5wt suppressed proliferation of hcc cells via induction of gm arrest, while ectopic expression of ncoa5t445a had a significantly lesser effect compared to ectopic expression of ncoa5wt. furthermore, ectopic expression of ncoa5wt increased the occurrence of dna damage and cell senescence, whereas expression of ncoa5t445a partly lost this activity. xenograft tumor model analysis demonstrated that ectopic ncoa5wt expression reduced hcc tumor growth and the t445a variation impairs its tumor growth inhibitory function. collectively, our data show that the t445a variation impairs the ability of ncoa5 to inhibit growth of hcc, suggesting that this variation may have potential to increase susceptibility to hcc comorbid with t2d.

cell_biology	the aim of this study was to develop a novel protocol for generating large populations of fully mature and functional human mast cells (hmc) from cd34(+) hematopoietic stem cells which require less culturing time than previously reported methods. cd34(+) cells isolated from fresh human buffy coats were sequentially cultured with different combinations of scf, il-6, il-3, il-9 and il-4 under selected culturing conditions and time periods. cells were then harvested for immunohistochemical characterization of morphological phenotypes and were functionally characterized by assessing their responses to ige-dependent and -independent stimuli by measuring the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. moreover, the pharmacological profiles of several classes of anti-inflammatory drugs in inhibiting the activation of these hmc were also characterized. we have developed a novel protocol that can generate large homogenous populations of mature and functional hmc in 6 weeks. these cells expressed both tryptase and chymase and were activated by anti-ige, cationic peptides and calcium ionophores. moreover, ige-dependent activation of these cells was significantly inhibited by anti-inflammatory drugs. the morphological and functional characteristics of these mast cells resembled those of mctc type or connective tissue-type hmc. our protocol represents a novel time-saving and economical approach for generating large numbers of primary hmc for functional studies of mast cell biology and for profiling novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents with mast cell-inhibitory properties in humans.
human_metabolism	the family of polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas), which can be found in most lipid classes, includes n-3 pufas essential for mammals and whose deficiency is associated with multiple diseases. because of their multiple physiological actions, n-3 pufas play a crucial role in normal human metabolism as well as maintenance of a healthy status, with clinical effects that are not limited to the cardiovascular system but also include maternal and offspring health, growth and development, immune system disorders, cancer, cognitive function and psychological status. multiple health organisations and scientific societies recommend increasing food-derived n-3 pufa intake and also suggest that patients with documented coronary heart disease receive a minimum of 1000 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. the preventive and therapeutic effects of n-3 pufas appear to be largely dependent on the dosages employed and the characteristics of selected patients. so, in the era of personalised medicine, the time has come to move from generic advice to increase n-3 pufa intake to a more evidence-based approach characterised by tailored indications to n-3 pufa dietary or supplement consumption. this approach will require evaluation on a case-to-case basis the potential usefulness of n-3 pufas, taking into consideration their 'pleiotropic effects', the optimal dose for any given indication in relation to international guidelines, potential interactions with background therapy, possible side effects, differences in genetics and dietary response to supplementation, and the cost: benefit ratio, which is likely to vary as a function of differences in the range of fish intake in the diet.

computer-aided_design	objectives: orbital surgery is a challenging procedure because of its complex anatomy. training could especially benefit from dedicated study models. the currently available devices lack sufficient anatomical representation and realistic soft tissue properties. hence, we developed a 3d-printed simulation device for orbital surgery with tactual (haptic) correct simulation of all relevant anatomical structures. design, setting, and participants: based on computed tomography scans collected from patients treated in a third referral center, the hard and soft tissue were segmented and virtually processed to generate a 3d-model of the orbit. hard tissue was then physically realized by 3d printing. the soft tissue was manufactured by a composite silicone model of the nucleus and the surrounding tissue over a negative mold model also generated by 3d-printing. the final model was evaluated by a group of 5 trainees in oral and maxillofacial surgery (1) and a group of 5 consultants (2). all participants were asked to reconstruct an isolated orbital floor defect with a titanium implant. a stereotactic navigation system was available to all participants. their experience was evaluated for haptic realism, correct representation of surgical approach, general handling of model, insertion of implant into the orbit, placement and fixation of implant, and usability of navigated control. the items were evaluated via nonparametric statistics (1 [poor]-5 [good]). results: group 1 gave an average mark of 4.0 (+/- 0.9) versus 4.6 (+/- 0.6) by group 2. the haptics were rated as 3.6 (+/- 1.1) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.8) [2]. the surgical approach was graded 3.7 (+/- 1.2) [1] and 4.0 (+/- 1.0) [2]. handling of the models was rated 3.5 (+/- 1.1) [1] and 4 (+/- 0.7) [2]. the insertion of the implants was marked as 3.7 (+/- 0.8) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.8) [2]. fixation of the implants was also perceived to be,realistic with 3.6 (+/- 0.9) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.45) [2]. lastly, surgical navigation was rated 3.8 (+/- 0.8) [1] and 4.6 (+/- 0.56) [2]. conclusion: in this project, all relevant hard and soft tissue characteristics of orbital anatomy could be realized. moreover, it was possible to demonstrate that the entire workflow of an orbital procedure may be simulated. hence, using this model training expenses may be reduced and patient security could be enhanced.

polymerase_chain_reaction	fresh (frozen/thawed) muscle samples from four 2-12-year-old roe deer (capreolus capreolus) from the sondrio province in north-eastern italy were examined under a dissecting microscope, and about 180 sarcocysts were isolated and identified to morphological type in wet mounts by light microscopy (lm). seventy-seven of these sarcocysts were subsequently examined by molecular methods, comprising polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of the partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i gene (cox1) of all isolates, as well as pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of the complete18s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene of two isolates of each species found. by lm, three major sarcocyst types were recognised: spindle-shaped sarcocysts, 0.5-3 mm long, either with no clearly recognisable protrusions (thin-walled) or with finger-like protrusions (thick-walled); and slender, thread-like sarcocysts, 2-3 mm long, with hair-like protrusions. sequencing of cox1 revealed that the sarcocysts belonged to four different species. those with no visible protrusions either belonged to sarcocystis gracilis (n = 24) or to a sarcocystis taeniata-like species (n = 19), whereas those with finger- and hair-like protrusions belonged to sarcocystis silva (n = 27) and sarcocystis capreolicanis (n = 7), respectively. the 19 cox1 sequences of the s. taeniata-like species, comprising five haplotypes, differed from each other at 0-16 of 1038 nucleotide positions (98.5-100% identity). they differed from 25 previous cox1 sequences of s. taeniata from moose and sika deer (with 98.0-100% intraspecific identity), at 33-43 nucleotide positions (95.9-96.8% interspecific identity), and there were 20 fixed nucleotide differences between the two populations. in the phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 sequences, the two populations formed two separate monophyletic clusters. the s. taeniata-like species in roe deer was therefore considered to represent a separate species, which was named sarcocystis linearis n. sp. at the 18s rrna gene, however, the two species could not be clearly separated from each other. thus, there was considerable intraspecific sequence variation in the 18s rrna gene of s. linearis (98.1-99.9% identity between 24 sequences), which was similar both in magnitude and nature to the variation previously found in this gene of s. taeniata. the new 18s rrna gene sequences of s. linearis shared an identity of 97.9-99.6% with those of s. taeniata (overlap between intra- and interspecific identity), and in the phylogenetic tree, sequences of the two species were interspersed. by scanning electron microscopy (sem), the sarcocysts of s. linearis were found to possess regularly spaced, thin and narrow ribbon-like cyst wall protrusions (about 2.8-3.2 mu m long, 0.3-0.4 mu m wide and about 0.02-0.03 mu m thick), terminating in a plate-like structure of the same thickness but with an elliptic outline (about 0.3-0.4 mu m wide and 0.7-0.9 mu m long). the terminal plates were connected in the middle with the band-like portion of the protrusions like the board of a seesaw (tilting board). the terminal plates of adjacent protrusions were neatly arranged in a hexagonal pattern resembling tiles on a roof. together, they formed an outer roof-like layer facing the surrounding cytoplasm of the host cell and completely covering the band-like proximal portion of the protrusions, which overlapped and were stacked in three to four layers close to the cyst surface. the sarcocyst morphology of s. linearis was consistent with that of an unnamed sarcocystis sp. in roe deer previously found by transmission electron microscopy in several countries, including italy. a few sarcocysts of s. gracilis and s. silva were also examined by sem, confirming the presence of regularly distributed, short knob-like protrusions in s. gracilis (as seen in previous sem studies) and revealing tightly packed, erect 6-7-mu m-long villus-like protrusions having regularly distributed round depressions on their surface in s. silva. the sequencing of cox1 of 7, 24 and 27 new isolates of s. capreolicanis, s. gracilis and s. silva, respectively, recovered 7, 11 and 10 new haplotypes from each of the three species and expanded our knowledge on the intraspecific sequence variation at this marker. similarly, the study revealed a more extensive intragenomic sequence variation at the 18s rrna gene of s. capreolicanis and s. silva than known from previous studies and confirmed a near absence of such variation in the 18s rrna gene of s. gracilis.
internal_combustion_engine	the dynamic model proposed by charlette et al. represents an interesting alternative to the fsd balance equation to predict the transient growth of a flame kernel. the dynamic wrinkling model coupled to the algebraic flame surface density (fsd) model of boger et al. is here evaluated for the first time in an internal combustion engine configuration. preliminary tests enable to evidence practical difficulties when applying the model to this type of complex configuration. improvements are proposed to adapt the model to the engine configuration. final simulations are performed on a spark ignition engine configuration, using both the adapted dynamic model and an equilibrium wrinkling formulation. the results are compared to the ones obtained by robert et al. on the same configuration using the ecfm-les model solving a fsd balance equation. the dynamic model proves to very well predict out-of-equilibrium values and to account for cycle-to-cycle variabilities, as the model parameter is calculated on the fly. on the contrary, the results obtained using the equilibrium formulation clearly demonstrate that the flame-turbulence equilibrium assumption is not adapted to such configurations.

machine_design	in using a fly cutter to machine potassium dihydrogen phosphate (kdp) crystals, rippling in machined surfaces will remain that will have a significant impact on the optical performance. an analysis of these lowspatial frequency ripples is presented and its influence on the root-mean-squared gradient (grms) of the wavefront discussed. a frequency analysis of the machined kdp crystal surfaces is performed using wavelet transform and power spectral density methods. based on a classification of the time frequencies for these macroripples, the multimode vibration of the machine tool is found to be the main reason surface ripples are produced. improvements in the machine design parameters are proposed to limit such effects on the wavefront performance of the kdp crystal.

northern_blotting	endothelial cell dysfunction (ecd) is a common feature of chronic renal failure (crf). defective nitric oxide ( no) generation due to decreased endothelial no synthase ( enos) activity is a crucial parameter characterizing ecd. l-arginine is the sole precursor for no biosynthesis. among several transporters that mediate l-arginine uptake, cationic amino-acid transporter-1 (cat-1) acts as the specific arginine transporter for enos. our hypothesis implies that cat-1 is a major determinant of enos activity in crf. we studied glomerular and aortic arginine uptake, cat-1, and cat-2 messenger ribonucleic acid ( mrna) expression, and cat-1 protein in: ( a) rats 6 weeks following 5/6 nephrectomy ( crf), (b) sham-operated animals, and ( c) rats with crf treated orally with either atorvastatin or arginine in drinking water (modalities which have been shown to enhance enos activity and improve endothelial function). both glomerular and aortic arginine transport were significantly decreased in crf. treatment with either arginine or atorvastatin abolished the decrease in arginine uptake in crf rats. using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting, we found a significant increase in glomerular and aortic cat-1 mrna expression in crf. western blotting revealed that cat-1 protein was decreased in crf, but remained intact following arginine and atorvastatin administration. renal and systemic arginine uptake is attenuated in crf, through modulation of cat-1 protein. these findings provide a possible novel mechanism to enos inactivation and endothelial dysfunction in uremia.
human_metabolism	we report on a case of repeated mdpv consumptions that resulted in severe psychosis and agitation prompting the concomitant abuse of benzodiazepines. a 27-year-old man was found irresponsive in his apartment and was brought to the emergency department (ed) of a local hospital. when in ed, he rapidly recovered and self-reported to have recently injected some doses of mdpv that he had bought in the internet. he left the hospital without medical cares. 15 days after, he was again admitted to the same ed due to severe agitation, delirium and hallucinations, and reported the use of mdpv and pharmaceutical drugs during the preceding week. he was sedated with diazepam and chlorpromazine. urine samples collected in both occasions were sent for testing using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (lc-hrms) and liquid chromatography-high resolution multiple mass spectrometry (lc-hrms/ms) on an orbitrap. the lc-hrms analysis revealed the presence of mdpv and its phase i and phase ii metabolites (demethylenyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-methyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-methyl-oxo-mdpv, demethylenyl-hydroxy-alkyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-methyl-hydroxy alkyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-oxo-mdpv and their corresponding glucuronides), alprazolam and alprazolam metabolite at the first ed admission; at the time of the second ed access, the same mdpv metabolites, alprazolam, temazepam, and chlordiazepoxide were detected together with diazepam and metabolites. lc-hrms/ms was use to determine the following concentrations, respectively on his first and second admission: mdpv 55 ng/ml, alprazolam 114 ng/ml, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam 104 ng/ml; mdpv 35 ng/ml, alprazolam 10.4 ng/ml, alpha -hydroxyalprazolam 13 ng/ml; chlordiazepoxide 13 ng/ml, temazepam 170 ng/ml, diazepam 1.3 ng/ml, nordiazepam 61.5, oxazepam 115 ng/ml. the toxicological findings corroborated the referred concomitant use of multiple pharmaceutical drugs and benzodiazepines. confirmation of previous hypothesis on human metabolism of mdpv could be inferred by the analysis of urine.

hydraulics	as a key component in accelerator driven system (ads), the spallation target is exposed to high irradiation intensity radiation, and a larger amount of heat is deposited on it. therefore, the cooling of the target is a challenging task in the target design. integrated target module with a solid beam window, and cooled by reactor primary coolant is a good contender for ads system. the numerical analysis of two target modules was performed by using finite element code to assess the target cooling capacity. it was found that with uniform inlet velocity, the geometry modification of the inlet could improve the heat transfer effectively. but with non-uniform inlet velocity, the geometry modification of the inlet had little effect on cooling capacity.

molecular_biology	work on standardising methods in the field of animal species differentiation has been intensified in germany in recent years, not least due to the horsemeat scandal in 2013. even though there are now hardly ever any positive findings any more in examinations to detect horse elements in foods such as lasagne, animal species differentiation altogether ranks high in detecting adulteration of foods. this article therefore summarises the current status of analysis techniques in germany with a focus on standardisation. it has been established by the working group ""biochemical and molecular biological analytics"" of the lebensmittelchemische gesellschaft (food chemistry society within the german chemical society) with support of experts in the working group ""molecular biology techniques for differentiating plant and animal species"" [ 64 of the german food and feed code - lfgbi and the ""immunology and molecular biology"" task force of the food hygiene and food of animal origin working group (alts), both from germany.
enzymology	the access to kinetic parameters of lipolytic enzyme adsorption onto lipids is essential for a better understanding of interfacial enzymology and lipase-lipid interactions. the interfacial adsorption of dog gastric lipase (dgl) was monitored as a function of ph and surface pressure (pi), independently from the catalytic activity, using non-hydrolysable 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (dlpc) monomolecular films. the acid-stable dgl, which initiates fat digestion in the stomach, was then selected because its adsorption kinetics onto hydrophobic solid surfaces were already studied. this gastric lipase was therefore used as a model enzyme to validate both experimental and theoretical approaches. results show that the adsorption process of dgl at the lipid/water interface depends on a ph-dependent adsorption equilibrium coefficient which is optimum at ph 5.0 (k-ads = 1.7 +/- 0.05 x 10(8) m-1). k-ads values further allowed an indirect estimation of the molar fraction (phi(e'(%)), mol%) as well as the molecular area (a(e')) of dgl adsorbed onto dlpc monolayer. based on these data, a model for dgl adsorption onto dlpc monolayer at ph 5.0 is proposed for a surface pressure range of 15-25 mn m(-1).

enzymology	a novel lyase activity enzyme is characterized for the first time: hmg-coa lyase-like1 (er-chl), which is a close homolog of mitochondrial hmg-coa lyase (mhl). initial data show that there are nine mature transcripts for the novel gene hmgcll1, although none of them has all its exons. the most abundant transcript is called ""variant b,"" and it lacks exons 2 and 3. moreover, a three-dimensional model of the novel enzyme is proposed. colocalization studies show a dual location of the er-chl in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and cytosol, but not in mitochondria or peroxisomes. furthermore, the dissociation experiment suggests that it is a nonendoplasmic reticulum integral membrane protein. the kinetic parameters of er-chl indicate that it has a lower v-max and a higher substrate affinity than mhl. protein expression and lyase activity were found in several tissues, and were particularly strong in lung and kidney. the occurrence of er-chl in brain is surprising, as mhl has not been found there. although mhl activity is clearly associated with energy metabolism, the results suggest that er-chl is more closely related to another metabolic function, mostly at the pulmonary and brain level.-arnedo, m., s. menao, b. puisac, m. e. teresa-rodrigo, m. c. gil-rodriguez, e. lopez-vinas, p. gomez-puertas, n. casals, c. h. casale, f. g. hegardt, and j. pie. characterization of a novel hmg-coa lyase enzyme with a dual location in endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. j. lipid res. 2012. 53: 2046-2056.
southern_blotting	endogenous non-retroviral rna like sequences (nrvss) have been discovered in the genome of a wide range of eukaryotes. these are considered as fossil rna viral elements integrated into host genomes by as-yet-known mechanisms, and in many cases, those fossils are estimated to be millions-of-years-old. it is likely that the number of nrvs records will increase rapidly due to the growing availability of whole-genome sequences for many kinds of eukaryotes. discovery of the novel nrvss and understanding of their phylogenetic relationship with modern viral relatives provide important information on deep evolutionary history of rna virus-host interactions. in this chapter, therefore, the common strategies for the identification and characterization of endogenous nrvss from plants, insects, and fungi are described.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: to identify the effects of interleukin (il) -13 on retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cells and the il -13 level in aqueous humor of age-related macular degeneration (amd) patients. methods: il -13 levels in aqueous humor specimens from amd patients were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). arpe-19 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml il -13 for 12, 24, and 48h. the cell proliferaton was evaluated by the mts method. the mrna and protein levels of alpha-sma and zo-1 were evaluated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) and western blot respectively. the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta)and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) were assessed by elisa. results: il -13 levels in the aqueous humor of patients with amd were significantly higher than those in the control (167.33 +/- 17.64 vs 27.12 +/- 5.65 pg/ml; p<0.01). in vitro, il -13 of high concentrations (10, 15, and 20 ng/ml) inhibited arpe-19 cell proliferation. a-sma mrna in arpe-19 cell were increased (1.017 +/- 0.112 vs 1.476 +/- 0.168; p<0.001) and zo-1 decreased (1.051 +/- 0.136 vs 0.702 +/- 0.069; p<0.001) after treated with 10 ng/ml il -13 for 48h. the protein expression of a-sma and zo-1 also showed the same tendency (a-sma: p=0.038; zo-1: p=0.008). il -13 significantly reduced the level of tnf-a (44.7 +/- 01.67 vs 31.79 +/- 3.53 pg/ml; p=0.005) at 48h, but the level of tgf-i32 was significantly increased from 34.44 +/- 2.92 to 57.61 +/- 6.31 pg/ml at 24h (p=0.004) and from 61.26 +/- 1.11 to 86.91 +/- 3.59 pg/ml at 48h (p<0.001). while expressions of vegf did n't change after il -13 treatment. conclusion: il -13 in vitro inhibit arpe-19 cell proliferation and expression in the aqueous may be associated with amd.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the objective of this study was to measure the effect of selection for tolerance on the severity of the aleutian disease (ad) lesions in mink. sensitivity and specificity of antibody detection in the blood by counter-immunoelectrophoresis (ciep) relative to the presence of aleutian mink disease virus (amdv) in the spleen by pcr in naturally infected farmed mink were also estimated. carcasses of 680 sero-positive (ciep-p) black mink from 28 farms in nova scotia, canada, and from 132 sero-negative (ciep-n) mink from 14 of these farms were collected at pelting time. a total of 116 of the ciep-p mink were from three farms where animals have been selected for tolerating ad for almost 20 years. the severity of the ad lesions was assessed by histopathological examination of kidneys, lungs, heart, brain and liver on a scale of 0 to 4. sensitivity and specificity of ciep relative to pcr were 0.97 and 0.85, respectively, and 16.5% of ciep-n mink were pcr positive, which could be one of the reasons for the failure of virus eradication by ciep in canada. the ciep-n and tolerant ciep-p animals had 9.39 and 6.23 greater odds of showing lower lesion severity, respectively, than the ciep-p animals (p < 0.01). the ciep-n mink had a slightly higher chance (p = 0.07) of showing lower lesion severity (odds ratio 1.51) compared with tolerant ciepp mink. the results suggested that tolerant mink had significantly reduced severity of ad lesions despite having anti-viral antibodies and carrying the virus.

enzymology	in vitro metabolism of tanzisertib [(1s, 4r)-4-(9-((s)tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)-8-(2,4,6-trifluorophenylamino)- 9h-purin-2-ylamino) cyclohexanol], a potent, selective c-jun amino-terminal kinase (jnk) inhibitor, was investigated in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes over 4 h. the extent of metabolism of [c-14] tanzisertib was variable, with <10% metabolized in dog and human,75% metabolized in rat and mouse. primary metabolic pathways in human and dog hepatocytes, were direct glucuronidation and oxidation of cyclohexanol to a keto metabolite, which was subsequently reduced to parent or cis-isomer, followed by glucuronidation. rat and mouse produced oxidative metabolites and cis-isomer, including direct glucuronides and sulfates of tanzisertib and cis-isomer. enzymology of oxido-reductive pathways revealed that human aldo-keto reductases akr1c1, 1c2, 1c3 and 1c4 were responsible for oxido-reduction of tanzisertib, cc-418424 and keto tanzisertib. characterizations of enzyme kinetics revealed that akr1c4 had a high affinity for reduction of keto tanzisertib to tanzisertib compared to other isoforms. these results demonstrate unique stereoselectivity of the reductive properties documented by human akr1c enzymes for the same substrate. characterization of ugt isoenzymes in glucuronidation of tanzisertib and cc-418424 revealed that, tanzisertib glucuronide was catalyzed by: ugt1a1, 1a4, 1a10 and 2b4, while cc-418424 glucuronidation was catalyzed by ugt2b4 and 2b7.
genetics	understanding howhost dynamics, including variations of population size and dispersal, may affect the epidemiology of infectious diseases through ecological and evolutionary processes is an active research area. here we focus on a bank vole (myodes glareolus) metapopulation surveyed in finland between 2005 and 2009. bank vole is the reservoir of puumala hantavirus (puuv), the agent of nephropathia epidemica (ne, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptom) in humans. m. glareolus populations experience multiannual density fluctuations that may influence the level of genetic diversity maintained in bank voles, puuv prevalence and ne occurrence. we examine bank vole metapopulation genetics at presumably neutral markers and immunerelated genes involved in susceptibility to puuv (tnf-promoter, tlr4, tlr7 and mx2 gene) to investigate the links between population dynamics, microevolutionary processes and puuv epidemiology. we show that genetic drift slightly and transiently affects neutral and adaptive genetic variability within the metapopulation. gene flow seems to counterbalance its effects during the multiannual density fluctuations. the low abundance phase may therefore be too short to impact genetic variation in the host, and consequently viral genetic diversity. environmental heterogeneity does not seem to affect vole gene flow, which might explain the absence of spatial structure previously detected in puuv in this area. besides, our results suggest the role of vole dispersal on puuv circulation through sex-specific and density-dependent movements. we find little evidence of selection acting on immune-related genes within this metapopulation. footprint of positive selection is detected at tlr-4 gene in 2008 only. we observe marginally significant associations between mx2 genotype and puuv genogroups. these results show that neutral processes seem to be the main factors affecting the evolution of these immune-related genes at a contemporary scale, although the relative effects of neutral and adaptive forces could vary temporally with density fluctuations. immune related gene polymorphism may in turn partly influence puuv epidemiology in this metapopulation.

southern_blotting	high levels of homologous recombination are induced during meiosis. this meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed formation of dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) by a conserved meiosis-specific protein, spoil. meiotic dsbs are not formed at random along chromosomes but are formed in clusters known as recombination hot spots. to understand the regulation of this initiation step of meiotic recombination, determining the timing and location of meiotic dsbs is essential. in this chapter, we describe a method to detect genome-wide meiotic dsbs by using a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern blotting.
immunology	acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is characterized by the proliferation of immature myeloid lineage blasts. due to its heterogeneity and to the high rate of acquired drug resistance and relapse, new treatment strategies are needed. here, we demonstrate that ifn promotes aml blasts to act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy. treatment with ifn drove aml blasts toward a more differentiated state, wherein they showed increased expression of the m1-related markers hla-dr and cd86, as well as of fcri, which mediates effector responses to therapeutic antibodies. importantly, ifn was able to up-regulate cd38, the target of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab. because the antigen (cd38) and effector receptor (fcri) were both simultaneously up-regulated on the aml blasts, we tested whether ifn treatment of the aml cell lines thp-1 and mv4-11 could stimulate them to target one another after the addition of daratumumab. results showed that ifn significantly increased daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity, as measured both by cr-51 release and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. we also found that the combination of ifn and activation of fcr led to the release of granzyme b by aml cells. finally, using a murine nsg model of subcutaneous aml, we found that treatment with ifn plus daratumumab significantly attenuated tumor growth. taken together, these studies show a novel mechanism of daratumumab-mediated killing and a possible new therapeutic strategy for aml.
strength_of_materials	the aim of this paper is to study the shear transfer mechanism through the horizontal contact surface of two rigid blocks. the shear resistance offered by this contact interface is the main mechanism mobilized by the structural elements of many ancient stone dry-masonry structures in order to transfer horizontal actions from earthquakes and wind forces to the foundation. in some cases a certain connection exists between two blocks at the contact surface, which is materialized by wooden or metal parts at the central area of the blocks (poles, empolia). the role of this connection in transferring horizontal forces and its influence on the seismic behaviour is a point long debated by the research community. cyclic experiments were performed at the laboratory of strength of materials and structures of aristotle university of thessaloniki-greece in order to study this sliding behaviour at the interface between two rigid blocks. the experimental sequence under investigation can be divided into two groups. the first group includes specimens without any connection between the rigid blocks, while the second group includes specimens with poles and empolia connecting the rigid blocks. during all tests the imposed cyclic horizontal sliding displacement was combined with constant level of vertical load applied at the top of the upper block. through this experimental process, it became possible to describe the shear transfer mechanism through diagrams of horizontal sliding displacement versus horizontal load, and study the effects on the shear transfer behaviour between these rigid blocks without or with the connection with poles and empolia between them. numerical finite element simulations of this shear transfer mechanism were also performed utilizing two commercial finite element software packages.
computer-aided_design	objective: to fabricate orthodontic brackets from esthetic materials and determine their fracture resistance during archwire torsion.. materials and methods: computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology (cerec inlab, sirona) was used to mill brackets with a 0.018 x 0.025-inch slot. materials used were paradigm mz100 and lava ultimate resin composite (3m espe), mark ii feldspathic porcelain (vita zahnfabrik), and in-ceram yz zirconia (vita zahnfabrik). ten brackets of each material were subjected to torque by a 0.018 x 0.025-inch stainless steel archwire (g&h) using a specially designed apparatus. the average moments and degrees of torsion necessary to fracture the brackets were determined and compared with those of commercially available alumina brackets, mystique mb (dentsply gac). results: the yz brackets were statistically significantly stronger than any other tested material in their resistance to torsion (p < .05). the mean torques at failure ranged from 3467 g.mm for mark ii to 11,902 g.mm for yz. the mean torsion angles at failure ranged from 15.3 to 40.9 degrees. conclusion: zirconia had the highest torsional strength among the tested esthetic brackets. resistance of mz100 and lava ultimate composite resin brackets to archwire torsion was comparable to commercially available alumina ceramic brackets.
thermodynamics	water soluble amphiphilic anion receptors based on urea-substituted 13-cyclodextrin were synthesized via a copper(i) mediated azide-alkyne coupling reaction. the synthetic route was designed to minimize the number of operations of cyclodextrins. stable products were obtained in 90% yield. they were successfully tested as amino acid receptors, showing excellent affinity constants (10(3)-10(4)m(-1)) in a highly competitive environment (ph 8 phosphate-buffered water solution). isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that complex formation strongly depends on the hydrophobic nature of the guest and that the urea moiety of the receptor is necessary to efficiently bind amino acids.

immunology	purpose of review the anca-associated vasculitides are a group of small vessel vasculitides characterized by autoantibodies recognizing the neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens pr3 and mpo. we examine the current clinical and molecular immunology understanding of anca-associated vasculitides and discuss the current needs in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these rare diseases. recent findings the majority of efforts to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases have focused on dissecting neutrophil biology because the neutrophil is the primary expressor of anca autoantigens. however, a number of important genetic, clinical, and cellular biology observations suggest that attempts to understand the pathogenesis of anca vasculitides should move away from emphasis on the role of the neutrophil and instead re-focus on the potential role of other immune cell mediators. summary whether or not neutrophils are the key determinant of anca-associated vasculitis pathogenesis should be revisited in detail. a neutrophil-centric view of the pathogenesis of these diseases cannot fully account for important genetic, clinical, and cellular biology observations that implicate important and under-appreciated roles for monocytes and t cells. refocusing on these findings will likely lead to new discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the identification of clinically useful biomarkers for disease activity.
northern_blotting	endothelin-1 (et-1) is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. we investigated the effects of et-1 on intracellular calcium transient and its mechanisms. neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared and calcium transient was measured using fura-2. treatment with et-1 for 48 h prolonged calcium transient decay. in the presence of thapsigargin, et-1 did not alter calcium transient decay. on the other hand, the prolonged calcium transient decay was maintained even when sodium was removed from the bath solution. these results indicate that et-1-induced prolongation of calcium transient decay is mainly due to the suppression of calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not inhibition of the sodium/calcium exchanger. northern blotting analysis revealed that sarcoplasmic reticulum atpase (serca2) mrna was decreased in et-1-treated cardiomyocytes, and that this decrease was inhibited by bq-123 but not by bq-788. moreover, pretreatment with chelerythrine partially restored the et-1-induced decrease in serca2 mrna, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate markedly reduced serca2 gene expression. real-time rt-pcr analysis showed abundant eta receptor gene expression in cardiomyocytes. et-1 reduces serca2 gene expression through the eta receptor and pkc pathway, and prolongs intracellular calcium transient decay. specific inhibition of the eta receptor may be a possible therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac performance.
fluid_mechanics	the simple phenomenon of a water drop falling onto a glass plate may seem like a trivial fluid mechanics problem. however, detailed imaging has shown that this process is highly complex and a small air-bubble is always entrapped under the drop when it makes contact with the solid. this bubble can interfere with the uniformity of spray coatings and degrade inkjet fabrication of displays etc. we will describe how we use high-speed interferometry at 5 million frames per second to understand the details of this process. as the impacting drop approaches the solid, the dynamics are characterized by a balance between the lubrication pressure in the thin air layer and the inertia of the bot-tom of the drop. this deforms the drop, forming a dimple at its bottom and making the drop touch the surface along a ring, thereby entrapping the air-layer, which is typically 1-3 mu m thick. this air-layer can be highly compressed and the deceleration of the bottom of the drop can be as large as 300,000 g. we describe how the thicknessevolution of the lubricating air-layer is extracted from following the interference fringes between frames. two-color interferometry is also used to extract absolute layer thicknesses. finally, we identify the effects of nanometric surface roughness on the first contact of the drop with the substrate. here we need to resolve the 100 nm thickness changes occurring during 200 ns intervals, requiring these state of the art high-speed cameras. surprisingly, we see a ring of micro-bubbles marking the first contact of the drop with the glass, only for microscope slides, which have a typical roughness of 20 nm, while such rings are absent for drop impacts onto molecularly smooth mica surfaces.
thermodynamics	we describe a quantitative model for heat separation in a fluid due to motion along a pressure gradient. the physical model involved is relevant to one explanation for the temperature separation in a vortex tube. this effect has a point of saturation in which the fluid 's temperature and pressure are related at its boundaries by an adiabatic law. vortex tube models sometimes assume that this saturation is achieved in physical devices. we conclude that this is likely to be a safe assumption much of the time, but we describe circumstances in which saturation might not be achieved. we propose a test of our model of temperature separation.

materials_engineering	the goal of the study was to find a cost-effective composition of a particle reinforced composite that is light in weight but has sufficient mechanical properties. the matrix of the particulate composite is unsaturated polyester resin that is reinforced with alumina trihydrate particles. part of the alumina trihydrate proportion was replaced with hollow glass microspheres to reduce weight and save costs. in order to find out the influence of the light filler on the physical and mechanical properties of composites, materials with different percentages of the light filler were prepared. test specimens were cut from moulded sheets that were fabricated with vacuum assisted extruder. tensile strength, indentation hardness measured with a barcol impressor, and density were determined. based on the experimental data a multi-criteria optimization problem was formulated and solved to find the optimal design of the material. artificial neural networks and a hybrid genetic algorithm were used. the optimal solution is given as a pareto curve to represent the distinction between the density and selected mechanical properties of the composite material. the composite material filled with 6% hollow glass microspheres showed 3% loss in the tensile strength and 26% loss in the surface hardness compared to the composition without the filler. the weight decreased by 13% compared with the initial composition. the addition of hollow glass microspheres did not lower the net value of the material, it increased 7%.
machine_design	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to focus on the machine design and control strategy of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (pmsg) system, especially utilized in variable speed applications, in order to stabilize the output voltage on the dc link over a wide speed range. design/methodology/approach - different ac/dc power converter topologies are comparatively studied, each with an accordingly designed pmsg, so as to investigate the influence of the armature winding inductance as well as the relationship between the pmsg and power converter topologies. findings - pulse width modulation (pwm) rectifier is preferable for the said application due to its good performance and controllability. moreover, by employing the pwm rectifier, relatively large inductance of the pmsg is considered for both short-circuit current reduction and field regulation. originality/value - field-regulating control is realized with a space vector pwm (svpwm) rectifier, which can weaken the pmsg magnetic field during high-speed operation, while even properly enhance the field at low speed, ensuring a small change of the pmsg output voltage and a stable dc voltage.
materials_engineering	critical metals are significantly important in the preparation of high-tech materials associated with applications on, e.g., renewable energy, sustainable materials engineering and cleaner production. this importance together with supply risk to a substantial extent within the european union (eu) has pushed their recovery from waste being highlighted. electronic waste, usually from end-of-life electronic products, is a notable secondary resource for this purpose because of its distinctive features. a range of critical metals, including rareearth metals, indium, cobalt and valuable metals, such as copper, silver and gold, are possibly recovered from electronic waste. on top of the current practices of electronic waste recycling, it requires innovations on technology and breakthroughs on process design in order to promote critical metal recovery or electronic waste treatment (in general) to be green and sustainable. significant potentials are more and more noticed from hydrochemistry (metallurgy) technologies (processes) that contribute to this development because of its flexibility, relatively high recovery rate and extraction selectivity of critical metals, and possibilities of eliminating secondary waste. in this review, critical evaluation is carried out on the aspects of (1) understanding the features of different hydrochemistry processes for recycling of (critical) metals from electronic waste; (2) identifying the difficulties for a process to be implemented into industrial application which still originate from the high complexity of electronic waste and the secondary waste generation, e.g., wastewater; (3) defining circulability of metals to be recovered and recognizing their potentials to zero waste scheme. according to the evaluation, sustainable even zero waste processing is expected to be achieved for electronic waste treatment in the long term that it is preferred to reduce or prevent the generation of electronic waste and improve material efficiency from the whole life cycle of electronic products.
cell_biology	proteomic studies have facilitated the identification of proteins associated with the detergent-resistant membrane (drm) fraction in a variety of cell types. here, we have undertaken label-free quantitative (lfq) proteomic profiling of the proteins associated with detergent-resistant plasma and internal membranes from resting and activated platelets. one hundred forty-one proteins were identified and raw data is available via proteomexchange with identifier pxd002554. the proteins identified include a myriad of important platelet signaling and trafficking proteins including rap1b, src, snap-23, syntaxin-11, and members of the previously unattributed ragulator complex. mean lfq intensities calculated across three technical replicates for the three biological donors revealed that several important platelet signaling proteins altered their detergent solubility upon activation, including gpib alpha, gpib beta, src, and 14-3-3 zeta. altered detergent solubility for gpib zeta, following activation using a variety of platelet agonists, was confirmed by immunoblotting and further coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that gpib alpha forms a complex with 14-3-3 zeta that shifts into drms following activation. taken together, proteomic profiling of platelet drms allowed greater insight in the complex biology of both drms and platelets and will be a useful subproteome to study platelet-related disease. all ms data have been deposited in the proteomexchange with identifier pxd002554 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/pxd002554).
northern_blotting	rna interference (rnai) is a powerful tool for functional gene analysis, which has been successfully used to down-regulate the levels of specific target genes. in this study a microrna 159a-based binary vector was constructed which can be used for hprna expression. hairpin (hp) rna expression cassettes carrying the gene sequences are typically constructed on binary plasmid and delivered into plant cells by agrobacteriurn-mediated genetic transformation. this system allows simple insertion of 21- nt target gene sequences into microrna backbone, to facilitate the processing of microrna hprna by the endogenous machinery of host, thereby producing artificial microrna carrying the sequence of target gene(s). the functionality of new vector system was tested by silencing viral gene in transgenic plants. strong down regulation of viral gene was observed in virus infected tobacco plants transformed with pamir(159) vector. the processing of amirna leading to viral-specific sirna was confirmed by northern blotting. this vector system provides an important addition to the plant molecular biologists' toolbox, which will significantly facilitate the use of rnai technology for analyses of various gene functions in plant cells.
machine_design	the performance of a reluctance synchronous machine (rsm) strongly depends on the well-designed geometry of the stator and rotor. within the intention of a high torque and a high power factor both, the difference and the ratio of the direct- and quadrature inductance must be set to a maximum. in this paper an easy (semi-)analytic design method is used to determine these inductances for a reluctance machine with a standard induction machine stator and a multiple flux-barrier rotor. by varying the rotor and stator dimensions, such as the bore diameter and slot geometry, the effect on the difference and the ratio of the inductances and therefore on the output performance parameters is studied. for the analysis a simplified analytical model, such as a magnetic circuit model of the reluctance synchronous machine is created and solved iteratively. the rsm leakage inductances are determined by using the same analytical equations as used for induction motors. an optimum design for various objective functions like maximum torque, maximum torque per kva and maximum torque per volume is found, by the means of the analytic model. as a result important conclusions are achieved, regarding the stator and rotor design, respectively.
molecular_biology	pancreatic lipase is a potential therapeutic target to treat diet-induced obesity in humans, as obesity-related diseases continue to be a global problem. despite intensive research on finding potential inhibitors, very few compounds have been introduced to clinical studies. in this work, new chemical scaffold 1h-indene-(1,3,5,6)-tetrol was proposed using knowledge-based approach, and 36 inhibitors were derived by modifying its functional groups at different positions in scaffold. to explore binding affinity and interactions of ligands with protein, cdocker and autodock programs were used for molecular docking studies. analyzing results of rigid and flexible docking algorithms, inhibitors c_12, c_24, and c_36 were selected based on different properties and high predicted binding affinities for further analysis. these three inhibitors have different moieties placed at different functional groups in scaffold, and to characterize structural rationales for inhibitory activities of compounds, molecular dynamics simulations were performed (500 nsec). it has been shown through simulations that two structural fragments (indene and indole) in inhibitor can be treated as isosteric structures and their position at binding cleft can be replaced by each other. taking into account these information, two lines of inhibitors can further be developed, each line based on a different core scaffold, that is, indene/indole.

enzymology	few studies have examined the effect of black tea (camellia sinensis) theaflavins on obesity-related tart gets. pancreatic lipase (pl) plays a central role in fat metabolism and is a validated target for weight loss. we compared the inhibitory efficacy of individual theaflavins and explored the underlying mechanism. theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (tfdig), theaflavin-3'-gallate, theaflavin-3-gallate, and theaflavin inhibited pl with ic50 of 1.9, 4.2, 3.0, and >10 mu mol/l. the presence and location of the galloyl ester moiety were essential for inhibitory potency. tfdig exhibited mixed inhibition with respect to substrate concentration. in silico modeling showed that theaflavins bind to asn263 and asp206, which form a pocket adjacent to the active site, and galloyl-containing theaflavins are then predicted to perturb the protonation of his264. these data provide a putative mechanism to explain the anti-obesity effects of tea.

machine_design	conventional mri protocols are an integral part of routine clinical imaging in pediatric patients. the advent of several newer mri techniques provides crucial insight into the structural integrity and functional aspects of the developing brain, especially with the introduction of 3t mri systems in clinical practice. the field of pediatric neuroimaging continues to evolve, with greater emphasis on high spatial resolution, faster scan time, as well as a quest for visualization of the functional aspects of the human brain. mr vendors are increasingly focusing on optimizing mr technology to make it suitable for children, in whom as compared to adults the head size is usually smaller and demonstrates inherent neuroanatomical differences relating to brain development. the eventual goal of these advances would be to evolve as potential biomarkers for predicting neurodevelopment outcomes and prognostication, in addition to their utility in routine diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. advanced mr techniques like diffusion tensor imaging, functional mri, mr perfusion, spectroscopy, volumetric imaging and arterial spin labeling add to our understanding of normal brain development and pathophysiology of various neurological disease processes. this review is primarily focused on outlining advanced mr techniques and their current and potential pediatric neuroimaging applications as well as providing a brief overview of advances in hardware and machine design.
molecular_biology	objective: to review contemporary knowledge of the hcg molecule, its isoforms and the importance of glycosylation. biologic variants and glycoforms of hcg have different biological activities and functions related to the control of menstrual cycle, conception, gestation as well as gynaecologic and non-gynaecologic malignancies. design: a review. setting: department of obstetrics and gynaecology, university hospital olomouc. methods: to present own experience and an overview of recent literature in molecular biology, clinical biochemistry and clinical practice. conclusion: recent knowledge of the role of hcg glycosylation in physiologic and pathologic events in female organism will provide a better understanding of regulation of processes like ovulation (co-operation of pituitary hcg with lh), implantation and hemochorial placentation (invasivity of hyperglycosylated hcg). some biologic variants and isoforms of hcg are important for the prediction of certain pathologies of pregnancy, prenatal screening of inborn errors (free beta hcg) as well as in the treatment of infertility.
northern_blotting	myocardial ischemic preconditioning up-regulated protein 1 (mipu1) was cloned in our laboratory. male wistar rats were subjected to left anterior coronary artery ligation and sham-operation and sacrificed at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 d or 5 d after ligation. expression of mipu1 mrna and protein were assessed by northern blotting, real-time quantitative rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and western blotting. expression of mipu1 was up-regulated at 3 h and lasted to 12 h with a peak at 6 h. mipu1 mrna and protein signals express in the endothelium and myocardium in normal and infarcted heart, mainly in infarcted zone. fluorescent immunocytochemistry showed that mipu1 protein was localized to the nuclei of h9c2 myogenic cells and was upregulated after the cells being exposed to h2o2. these observations indicates that mipu1 may play a role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and protecting the myogenic cells from being injured by ischemia-reperfusion or oxidation stress.
materials_engineering	deformation asymmetry of magnesium alloys is an important factor on machine design in the automobile industry. represented by the ratio of compressive yield stress (cys) against tensile yield stress (tys), deformation asymmetry is strongly related to texture and grain size. a polycrystalline viscoplasticity model, modified intermediate phi-model, is used to predict the deformation behavior of magnesium alloys with different grain sizes. validated with experimental results, integrated computational materials engineering is applied to find out the route in achieving desired asymmetry via thermomechanical processing. for example, cys/tys in rolled texture is smaller than 1 under different loading directions. in other textures, such as extruded texture, cys/tys is large along the normal direction. starting from rolled texture, asymmetry will increase to close to 1 along the rolling direction after being compressed to a strain of 0.2. our modified phi-model also shows that grain refinement increases cys/tys. along with texture control, grain refinement also can optimize the yield asymmetry. after the grain size decreases to a critical value, cys/tys reaches to 1 because cys increases much faster than tys. by tailoring the microstructure using texture control and grain refinement, it is achievable to optimize yield asymmetry in wrought magnesium alloys. published by elsevier b.v.
polymerase_chain_reaction	insect cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (cyps or p450s) play an important role in detoxifying insecticides leading to resistance in insect populations. a polyphagous pest, spodoptera litura, has developed resistance to a wide range of insecticides. in the present study, a novel p450 gene, cyp321b1, was cloned from s. litura. the function of cyp321b1 was assessed using rna interference (rnai) and monitoring resistance levels for three commonly used insecticides, including chlorpyrifos, beta-cypermethrin and methomyl. the full-length complementary dna sequence of cyp321b1 is 1814 bp long with an open reading frame of 1488 bp encoding 495 amino acid residues. quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses during larval and pupal development indicated that cyp321b1 expression was highest in the midgut of fifth-instar larvae, followed by fat body and cuticle. the expression of cyp321b1 in the midgut was up-regulated by chlorpyrifos, beta-cypermethrin and methomyl with both lethal concentration at 15% (lc15) (50, 100 and 150 mu g/ml, respectively) and 50%(lc50) dosages (100, 200 and 300 mu g/ml, respectively). addition of piperonyl butoxide (pbo) significantly increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos, beta-cypermethrin and methomyl to s. litura, suggesting a marked synergism of the three insecticides with pbo and p450-mediated detoxification. rnai-mediated silencing of cyp321b1 further increased mortality by 25.6% and 38.9% when the fifth-instar larvae were exposed to chlorpyrifos and beta-cypermethrin, respectively, at the lc50 dose levels. the results demonstrate that cyp321b1 might play an important role in chlorpyrifos and beta-cypermethrin detoxification in s. litura.
genetics	sydney rock oysters saccostrea glomerata are among the most important estuarine species on the eastern coast of australia and also the basis of a major aquaculture industry. the industry now largely relies on sydney rock oysters that have been selectively bred for fast growth and disease resistance. selectively bred s. glomerata are currently farmed in estuaries that also sustain wild populations of sydney rock oysters, providing the opportunity for interbreeding. this has led to concern that gene flow from farmed, selectively bred oysters could alter the genetic variability of wild oyster populations. here, we use next-generation genotype-by-sequencing to test for genetic introgression between wild and farmed, selectively bred (b2 line) sydney rock oysters from 2 sites in the georges river, nsw. strong genetic partitioning was identified between the wild and selectively bred populations. there was no evidence of gene flow in the form of introgression, even though selectively bred b2 oysters have been farmed in the georges river since the early 1990s. contrary to our expectations, we also found significantly higher levels of genetic diversity and heterozygosity in the selectively bred population relative to the wild population. the relatively low level of genetic diversity that we detected in wild oysters may be particularly relevant to the adaptive capacity of this species in the wild.
cell_biology	under the microscope, eukaryotic animal cells can adopt a variety of different shapes and sizes. these cells also move and deform, and the physical mechanisms driving these movements and shape changes are important in fundamental cell biology, tissue mechanics, as well as disease biology. this article reviews some of the basic mechanical concepts in cells, emphasizing continuum mechanics description of cytoskeletal networks and hydrodynamic flows across the cell membrane. we discuss how cells can generate movement and shape changes by controlling mass fluxes at the cell boundary. these mass fluxes can come from polymerization/depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton, as well as osmotic and hydraulic pressure-driven flow of water across the cell membrane. by combining hydraulic pressure control with force balance conditions at the cell surface, we discuss a quantitative mechanism of cell shape and volume control. the broad consequences of this model on cell mechanosensation and tissue mechanics are outlined.
computer-aided_design	in this work, an inas-based gate-all-around (gaa) arch-shaped tunneling field-effect transistor (tfet) was designed and analyzed using technology computer-aided design (tcad) simulations. to progress the dc/rf characteristics of gaa arch-shaped tfet, inas, a highly attractive iii-v compound material, is adopted as a channel material. owing to the gaa arch-shaped structure of tfet, the tunneling region under the gate area is extended, and the on-state current (i-on) and subthreshold-swing (s) are improved. however, it has some performance limitations that are related to the height of the source region (h-source) and the epitaxially grown thickness of the channel (t(epi)). thus, we performed a design optimization of the inas-based gaa arch-shaped tfet with the variables h-source and t(epi). after the optimization process, rf characteristics such as gate capacitance, transconductance (g(m)), cutoff frequency (f(t)), and maximum oscillation frequency (f(max)) were extracted and analyzed by small-signal rf modeling. finally, the designed inas-based gaa arch-shaped tfet demonstrated an i-on of 10.6 ma/mu m, s of 6.5 mv/dec, f(t) of 2.3 thz, and f(max) of 20 thz.
internal_combustion_engine	in practice, for effective exhaust waste heat recovery, a heat exchanger must exhibit a high heat transfer performance and a reasonable pressure drop to achieve a high net power output. therefore, a complete numerical thermoelectric generator (teg) model used for engine exhaust gas heat recovery is presented in this paper, based on a common plate-type exhaust heat exchanger. the model not only considered the temperature gradient along the fluid flow direction, but also included the fluid heat transfer and the flow resistance characteristics. the interaction relationships between the exchanger scales, heat transfer and flow resistance characteristics, and thermoelectric performance were mainly studied in this study by numerical simulations using the fortran program. results show that the high teg power can be achieved at the small cross section area, and corresponding to a small optimal module area. a small height is required when the cross section area is constant. to obtain the maximum net power with fluid flow resistance, the optimal cross section area should be 0.0056 m(2), with the optimal scales at a height of 0.005 m, and length of 0.56 m, when applied in an automotive vehicle. exchanger scales are available in a wide optimal design range to help achieve a high net power output, if the scale optimization match is met.

immunology	to date, the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) and the union for international cancer control (uicc) tumor, nodes, metastasis (tnm) classification represents the standard system for evaluation of prognosis in solid tumors. however, the clinical outcome can be significantly different in patients with the same tnm stage. therefore, many efforts have been made aiming to define new prognostic parameters. indeed, analyses conducted in large cohorts of colorectal cancer patients emphasized the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, leading to the development of a prognostic score referred to as ""immunoscore"". in this commentary, we recapitulate the study by gabrielson and colleagues, recently published in cancer immunology research, addressing the role of intratumoral cd3(+) and cd8(+) t cells as well as as prognostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma. the authors demonstrate that immunoscore represents a valuable prognostic marker in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have undergone primary tumor resection, supporting its application in a tumor setting other than colorectal cancer.
enzymology	radical s-adenosylmethionine (adomet) enzymes comprise a large superfamily of proteins that engage in a diverse series of biochemical transformations through generation of the highly reactive 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate. recent advances into the biosynthesis of unique iron-sulfur (fes)-containing cofactors such as the h-cluster in [fefe]-hydrogenase, the femo-co in nitrogenase, as well as the iron-guanylylpyridinol (fegp) cofactor in [fe]-hydrogenase have implicated new roles for radical adomet enzymes in the biosynthesis of complex inorganic cofactors. radical adomet enzymes in conjunction with scaffold proteins engage in modifying ubiquitous fes precursors into unique clusters, through novel amino acid decomposition and sulfur insertion reactions. the ability of radical adomet enzymes to modify common metal centers to unusual metal cofactors may provide important clues into the stepwise evolution of these and other complex bioinorganic catalysts. this article is part of a special issue entitled: radical sam enzymes and radical enzymology.

hydraulics	the goal of the paper is to describe the added value and complexities of nonlinear system identification applied to a large scale industrial test setup. the additional important insights provided by the frequency domain nonlinear approach are significant and for such systems the nonlinear system identification is important, for example to estimate the noise and non-linearities levels, which can indicate mechanical and configuration issues. it is not the goal to provide a final full-scale model, but to explore what is the applicability of the nonlinear system identification theories for a complex multi-physical non-academic test-case.

manufacturing_engineering	this paper describes how the manufacturing engineering technology (mnet) program at south dakota state university (sdsu) is using lean production techniques to map the educational outcomes across the curriculum. as a part of the accreditation review process, the mnet program has undertaken a project to determine whether the outcomes used in the program provide value to the constituents. a student research team has been assembled to value stream map the mnet program educational process. the needs of the customer, or educational outcomes that provide value, were determined through surveys and interviews with constituents of the program. a future state map will be developed and compared to a current state value stream map. using the information gleaned from these maps, the curriculum can be critically evaluated and changed to better meet the needs of its constituents.
computer-aided_design	data conversion from a 3d raster to spiral coordinates is the key function in the scanning process for roll powder sintering (rps) additive manufacturing technology. conversion process is especially important, as it produces the basis for a processed object. there are many equations for such conformal transformation, but there is still room to improve the computation efficiency. this paper presents an efficient conversion algorithm, which processes 3d objects and linear transforming it into rolling ribbon. the new algorithm has several significant advantages over the old ones due to applying only one main linear equation. the program based on the linear algorithm is simpler, more compact and faster in comparison to other programs which use trigonometric, transcendental or other equations. the proposed algorithm has been developed and extensively tested on several parts of computer-aided design models for rps processing.
enzymology	the h355a, h355k, h80a, and h80k mutant enzymes of the arge-encoded n-acetyl-l-ornithine deacetylase (arge) from escherichia coli were prepared, however, only the h355a enzyme was found to be soluble. kinetic analysis of the co(ii)-loaded h355a exhibited activity levels that were 380-fold less than co(ii)-loaded wt arge. electronic absorption spectra of co(ii)-loaded h355a-arge indicate that the bound co(ii) ion resides in a distorted, five-coordinate environment and isothermal titration calorimetry (itc) data for zn(ii) binding to the h355a enzyme provided a dissociation constant (k-d) of 39 mu m. a three-dimensional homology model of arge was generated using the x-ray crystal structure of the dape-encoded n-succinyl-l, l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (dape) from haemophilus influenzae confirming the assignment of h355 as well as h80 as active site ligands.
computer-aided_design	milling is a crucial step in producing restorations using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) systems. in this study the trueness of currently available milling devices was evaluated. thirty clinical cases (ten inlays, ten crowns, ten onlays) were milled from ceramic blocks using four different milling approaches: five axis with imes coritec 450i, four axis with cerec mcxl, four axis with cerec mcxl-ef and five axis with inlab mcx5. the milled restorations were scanned and the occlusal and inner surfaces compared to the originally calculated 3d surface using difference analysis software. the (90-10 %) / 2 percentile of the distances were calculated and analysed using one-way anova with the post hoc scheff, test (alpha = 0.05). chipping of marginal areas were visually examined and analysed using one-way anova with a post hoc tamhane test (alpha = 0.05). at inner surfaces, the milling trueness of imes (33.9 +/- 16.3 mu m), x5 (32.3 +/- 9.7 mu m) and mcxl-ef (34.4 +/- 7.5 mu m) was significantly better (p < 0.001) than that of mcxl (62.1 +/- 17.1 mu m). at occlusal surfaces, mcxl-ef (25.7 +/- 9.3 mu m) showed significant higher accuracy (p < 0.001) than mcxl (48.7 +/- 23.3 mu m) and x5 (40.9 +/- 20.4 mu m). imes produced the most chipping (p < 0.001). five-axis milling devices yield high trueness. mcxl-ef is competitive and may allow chairside fabrication with good milling results. accurate milling is required for well-fitting restorations and thereby requires fewer manual finishing steps, yields smaller marginal gaps, resistance to secondary caries and longevity of restorations.
genetics	tandem repeats are often associated with important chromosomal landmarks, such as centromeres, telomeres, subtelomeric, and other heterochromatic regions, and can be good candidates for molecular cytogenetic markers. tandem repeats present in many plant species demonstrate dramatic differences in unit length, proportion in the genome, and chromosomal organization. members of genus allium with their large genomes represent a challenging task for current genetics. using the next generation sequencing data, molecular, and cytogenetic methods, we discovered two tandemly organized repeats in the allium fistulosum genome (2n = 2c = 16), hat58 and cat36. together, these repeats comprise 0.25% of the bunching onion genome with 160,000 copies/1 c of hat58 and 93,000 copies/1 c of cat36. fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and c-banding showed that hat58 and cat36 associated with the interstitial and pericentromeric heterochromatin of the a. fistulosum chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 8. fish with hat58 and cat36 performed on a. cepa (2n = 2c = 16) and a. wakegi (2n = 2c = 16), a natural allodiploid hybrid between a. fistulosum and a. cepa, revealed that these repeats are species specific and produced specific hybridization patterns only on a. fistulosum chromosomes. thus, the markers can be used in interspecific breeding programs for monitoring of alien genetic material. we applied non-denaturing fish that allowed detection of the repeat bearing chromosomes within 3 h. a polymorphism of the hat58 chromosome location was observed. this finding suggests that the rapid evolution of the hat58 repeat is still ongoing.
genetics	nitrogen levels can modulate the effectiveness of clubroot resistance in an isolate- and host-specific manner. while the same qtl were detected under high and low nitrogen, their effects were altered. clubroot, caused by plasmodiophora brassicae, is one of the most damaging diseases of oilseed rape and is known to be affected by nitrogen fertilization. however, the genetic factors involved in clubroot resistance have not been characterized under nitrogen-limiting conditions. this study aimed to assess the variability of clubroot resistance under different nitrogen levels and to characterize the impact of nitrogen supply on genetic resistance factors. linkage analyses and a genome-wide association study were conducted to detect qtl for clubroot resistance and evaluate their sensitivity to nitrogen. the clubroot response of a set of 92 diverse oilseed rape accessions and 108 lines derived from a cross between 'darmor-bzh' (resistant) and 'yudal' (susceptible) was studied in the greenhouse under high- and low-nitrogen conditions, following inoculation with the p. brassicae isolates eh and k92-16. resistance to each isolate was controlled by a major qtl and a few small-effects qtl. while the same qtl were detected under both high and low nitrogen, their effects were altered. clubroot resistance to isolate eh, but not k92-16, was greater under a low-n supply versus a high-n supply. new sources of resistance were found among the oilseed rape accessions under both low and high-n conditions. the results are discussed relative to the literature and from a crop improvement perspective.
immunology	to summarize the principal findings on risk and protective factors for childhood asthma, we retrieved systematic reviews on these topics in children (aged 1 to 18 years), up to january 2016, through medline, embase, cinahl, scopus, and cdsr. a total of 227 studies were searched from databases. among those, 41 systematic reviews (srs) were included: 9 focused on prenatal factors, 5 on perinatal factors, and 27 on postnatal factors. of these 41 srs, 83% had good methodological quality, as determined by the assess systematic reviews tool. after reviewing all evidence, parental asthma, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke, and prematurity (particularly very preterm birth) are well-established risk factors for childhood asthma. current findings do suggest mild-to-moderate causal effects of certain modifiable behaviors or exposures during pregnancy (maternal weight gain or obesity, maternal use of antibiotics or paracetamol, and maternal stress), the perinatal period (birth by caesarean delivery), or postnatal life (severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, overweight or obesity, indoor exposure to mold or fungi, and outdoor air pollution) on childhood asthma, but this suggestive evidence must be confirmed in interventional studies or (if interventions are not feasible) well-designed prospective studies.

manufacturing_engineering	glass fiber-reinforced composite materials are finding numerous applications in many engineering and domestic fields due to their excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. among the machining processes used, drilling is one of the most important processes and is mainly used in joining of composite structures. maintaining of proper surface roughness in drilled holes is very important and is to be controlled. in the present work prediction of surface roughness in drilling of composite materials is carried out using fuzzy logic. in recent years, fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence has been used in manufacturing engineering for modeling and monitoring. an l27 orthogonal array is used for experimentation. a fuzzy rule-based model is developed to predict the surface roughness in drilling of glass fiber-reinforced plastic (gfrp) composites. good agreement is observed between the model results and experimental values. the analysis of experimental results is carried out using pareto analysis of variance (pareto-anova) and anova and presented in detail.
northern_blotting	activation of the akt (serine-threonine kinase) pathway is a common feature in glioblastoma cells. downstream factors of the akt pathway are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cellular migration and angiogenesis. micro-rnas (mirnas) are highly conserved small non-coding rnas that block targeted mrna expression at the post-transcriptional level. the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the akt pathway in regulating mirna. the changes of mirna expression profile in human glioblastome u251 cells after akt small interfering rna transfection were examined by a microarray, and confirmed by northern blotting. down-regulation of akt expression by sirna decreased the activity of akt pathway in u251 cells. interruption of akt pathway suppressed the expression of nf-kappa b and c-myc, furthermore, the expression of a set of mirnas was also changed after akt sirna transfection. there are putative binding sites of nf-kappa b and c-myc in the promoters of several up-regulated mirnas, indicating these transcription factors may also be involved in the regulation of mirna expression, thus affecting the activity of akt pathway in tumorigenesis. we provide new components of the regulatory function of akt pathway to better understand the regulatory network mediated by downstream transcription factors. the understanding of the regulatory function of akt pathway is crucial in tailored therapy of gliomas.
hydraulics	in the present work, the effect of nonlinear void reactivity on the dynamics of a simplified lumped parameter model for a boiling water reactor (bwr) is investigated. a mathematical model of five differential equations comprising of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics encompassing the nonlinearities associated with both the reactivity feedbacks and the heat transfer process has been used. to this end, we have considered parameters relevant to rbmk for which the void reactivity is known to be nonlinear. a nonlinear analysis of the model exploiting the method of multiple time scales (mmts) predicts the occurrence of the two types of hopf bifurcation, namely subcritical and supercritical, leading to the evolution of limit cycles for a range of parameters. numerical simulations have been performed to verify the analytical results obtained by mmts. the study shows that the nonlinear reactivity has a significant influence on the system dynamics. a parametric study with varying nominal reactor power and operating conditions in coolant channel has also been performed which shows the effect of change in concerned parameter on the boundary between regions of sub- and super-critical hopf bifurcations in the space constituted by the two coefficients of reactivities viz. the void and the doppler coefficient of reactivities. in particular, we find that introduction of a negative quadratic term in the void reactivity feedback significantly increases the supercritical region and dominates in determining the system dynamics.

machine_design	in this paper, a comparative optimal design of permanent magnet motors (pmms) for aerospace actuation applications based on single and double layer fractional slot concentrated winding (fscw) topologies with different motor segmentation strategies is undertaken, by means of a combined electromagnetic, fault tolerance and thermal evaluation. initially, analytical machine equations and 2d finite element (fe) analysis are employed for the determination of the motors basic dimensional and operating characteristics. both configurations considered are in a next step optimized regarding the mean torque, efficiency, torque ripple, induced electromotive force (emf) quality and motor weight. the proposed methodology involves appropriate handling of mean torque and induced emf as constraints through the application of a particular single-objective particle swarm optimization (pso) technique accounting also for multiple motor operating conditions. fault tolerance and thermal robustness of the optimized motors are also examined. both single layer and double layer fscw pmm optimal configurations present complementary advantages for this class of applications.
internal_combustion_engine	we analyse the impact of the current and an alternative stricter eu co2 car legislation on transport related co2 emissions, on the uptake of electric vehicles (ev), on the reduction of oil consumption, and on total energy system costs beyond 2020. we apply a times based energy system model for europe. results for 2030 show that a stricter target of 70 g co2/km for cars could reduce total transport co2 emissions by 5% and oil dependence by more than 2% compared to the current legislation. the stricter regulatory co2 car target is met by a deployment of more efficient internal combustion engine cars and higher shares of ev total system costs increase by less than 1%. the analysis indicates that ev deployment and the decarbonisation of the power system including higher shares of variable renewables can be synergistic. our sensitivity analysis shows that the deployment of ev would sharply increase between 2020 and 2030 at learning rates above 12.5%, reaching shares above 30% in 2030. finally, the study highlights that, besides legislating cars, policies for other transport sectors and modes are needed to curb transport related co2 emission growth by 2030.

cell_biology	purpose of reviewprimary cilia have become important organelles implicated in embryonic development, organogenesis, health, and diseases. although many studies in cell biology have focused on changes in ciliary length or ciliogenesis, the most common readout for evaluating ciliary function is intracellular calcium.recent findingsrecent tools have allowed us to examine intracellular calcium in more precise locations, that is, the cilioplasm and cytoplasm. advances in calcium imaging have also allowed us to identify which cilia respond to particular stimuli. furthermore, direct electrophysiological measurement of ionic currents within a cilium has provided a wealth of information for understanding the sensory roles of primary cilia.summarycalcium imaging and direct measurement of calcium currents demonstrate that primary cilia are sensory organelles that house several types of functional calcium channels. although intracellular calcium now allows a functional readout for primary cilia, discussions on the relative contributions of the several channel types have just begun. perhaps, all of these calcium channels are required and necessary to differentiate stimuli in different microenvironments.
northern_blotting	effects in the liver of fatal intoxication with the binary toxin ricin are unclear. we report a robust neutrophil influx into the liver of c57bl/6 mice after lethal parenteral ricin challenge, occurring in peri-portal and centro-lobular hepatic areas within 2 h, followed by the abrupt disappearance of hepatic macrophages/kupffer cells. chemokine profiles determined by microarray, ribonuclease protection assays, northern blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed rapid (2 h) upregulation and persistence of those for neutrophils (cxcl1/kc, cxcl2/mip-2) and monocytes (ccl2/mcp-1). red blood cell pooling (8-12 h), loss of hepatocyte glycogen (8-48 h) associated with progressive hypoglycemia, fibrin deposition (24-48 h), and death (72-96 h) followed. monoclonal antibody to ricin a chain, administered intravenously, blunted hypoglycemia, and abrogated death. this outcome was observed when anti-ricin antibody was given before toxin exposure as well as when administered approximately 10 h after toxin exposure. targeting antibody to specific amino-acid sequences on the ricin a chain (hael and qxxwxxa) was critical to the therapeutic effect. re-emergence of liver macrophages/kupffer cells and replenishment of glycogen in previously depleted hepatocytes preceded full recovery of the host. these data identify critical events for liver injury and healing in ricin intoxication, as well as a new means and specific targets for post- exposure therapeutic intervention.
polymerase_chain_reaction	bluetongue virus (btv) is a member of the genus orbivirus within the family reoviridae and causes a non-contagious, insect-transmitted disease in domestic and wild ruminants, mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and some species of deer. virus infection can trigger the changes of the cellular microrna (mirna) expression profile, which play important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. here, we employed deep sequencing technology to determine which cellular mirnas were differentially expressed in primary sheep testicular (st) cells infected with btv. a total of 25 known mirnas and 240 novel mirna candidates that were differentially expressed in btv-infected and uninfected st cells were identified, and 251 and 8428 predicted target genes were annotated, respectively. nine differentially expressed mirnas and their mrna targets were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. targets prediction and functional analysis of these regulated mirnas revealed significant enrichment for several signaling pathways including mapk, pi3k-akt, endocytosis, hippo, nf-kb, viral carcinogenesis, foxo, and jak-stat signaling pathways. this study provides a valuable basis for further investigation on the roles of mirnas in btv replication and pathogenesis.

cell_biology	aging affects numerous aspects of cell biology, but the senescence-associated changes in the stress response are only beginning to emerge. to obtain mechanistic insights into these events, we examined the formation of canonical and non-canonical stress granules (sgs) in the cytoplasm. sg generation is a key event after exposure to physiological or environmental stressors. it requires the sg-nucleating proteins g3bp1 and tia-1/tiar and stress-related signaling events. to analyze sg formation, we used two independent models of somatic cell aging. in both model systems, cellular senescence impaired the assembly of two sg classes: (i) it compromised the formation of canonical sgs, and (ii) skewed the production of non-canonical sgs. we dissected the mechanisms underlying these senescence-dependent changes in granule biogenesis and identified several specific targets that were modulated by aging. thus, we demonstrate a depletion of g3bp1 and tia-1/fiar in senescent cells and show that the loss of g3bp1 contributed to impaired sg formation. we further reveal that aging reduced sp1 levels; this transcription factor regulated g3bp1 and tia-1/fiar abundance. the assembly of canonical sgs relies on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor elf2 alpha. we show that senescence can cause elf2 alpha hyperphosphorylation. crep is a subunit of protein phosphatase 1 and critical to reverse the stress-dependent phosphorylation of elf2a. we demonstrate that the loss of crep correlated with the aging-related hyperphosphorylation of elf2 alpha. together, we have identified significant changes in the stress response of aging cells and provide mechanistic insights. based on our work, we propose that the decline in sg formation can provide a new biomarker to evaluate cellular aging.

cell_biology	maximizing the benefit of human pluripotent stem cells (hpscs) for research, disease modeling, pharmaceutical and clinical applications requires robust methods for the large-scale production of functional cell types, including cardiomyocytes. here we demonstrate that the temporal manipulation of wnt, tgf-beta, and shh signaling pathways leads to highly efficient cardiomyocyte differentiation of single-cell passaged hpsc lines in both static suspension and stirred suspension bioreactor systems. employing this strategy resulted in similar to 100% beating spheroids, consistently containing >80% cardiac troponin t-positive cells after 15 days of culture, validated in multiple hpsc lines. we also report on a variation of this protocol for use with cell lines not currently adapted to single-cell passaging, the success of which has been verified in 42 hpsc lines. cardiomyocytes generated using these protocols express lineage-specific markers and show expected electrophysiological functionalities. our protocol presents a simple, efficient and robust platform for the large-scale production of human cardiomyocytes.
genetics	background: this study reports on the analysis of the application and diagnostic predictability of the revised 2014 icbd criteria in an unselected cohort of uk patients, and the ensuing organ associations and patterns of disease. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted using a database of electronic medical records. three categories were recognised: clinically defined bd, incomplete bd and rejected diagnoses of bd. we applied the isg 1990 and icbd 2014 classification criteria to these subgroups to validate diagnostic accuracy against the multidisciplinary assessment. results: between 2012 and 2015, 281 patients underwent initial assessment at an urban tertiary care centre: 190 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bd, 7 with an incomplete diagnosis, and 84 with a rejected diagnosis. icbd 2014 demonstrated an estimated sensitivity of 97.89% (95% ci: 94.70 to 99.42) and positive likelihood ratio of 1.21 (1.10 to 1.28). the strongest independent predictors were: central nervous lesions (or = 10.57, 95% ci: 1.34 to 83.30); genital ulceration (or = 9.05, 95% ci: 3.35 to 24.47); erythema nodosum (or = 6.59, 95% ci: 2.35 to 18. 51); retinal vasculitis (or = 6.25, 95% ci: 1.47 to 26.60); anterior uveitis (or = 6.16, 95% ci: 2.37 to 16.02); posterior uveitis (or = 4.82, 95% ci: 1.25 to 18.59). conclusions: the icbd 2014 criteria were more sensitive at picking up cases than isg 1990 using the multidisciplinary assessment as the gold standard. icbd may over-diagnose bd in a uk population. patients who have an incomplete form of bd represent a distinct group that should not be given an early diagnostic label. behcet 's disease is a complex disease that is best diagnosed by multidisciplinary clinical assessment. patients in the uk differ in their clinical presentation and genetic susceptibility from the original descriptions. this study also highlights an incomplete group of behcet 's patients that are less well defined by their clinical presentation.
hydraulics	the failure of the barlin dam in taiwan, china offers an important case study for evaluating concepts in modeling the rapid erosion and channel recovery following intentional and unplanned dam removals. we present a modeling effort that applied a 1d and quasi-2d uncoupled hydraulics and sediment model (netstars) to evaluate how discretization and parameterization influence thefitofbed elevationpredictions to observations following dam failure. our analysis evaluated the model sensitivity to sediment transport function, active layer thickness, and number of stream tubes used to define the cross-section. results indicate that a) the model is more sensitive to active layer thickness and sediment transport function than to the number of stream tubes, b) development of dam removal models are likely to benefit from varying the active layer thickness in time, and c) increased lateral discretization does not appear to improve model fit in the steep and rapidly changing river environment at our site. we conclude with discussion on differences between, identifying the need for, and general use of 1d, quasi-2d, and fully 2d models in dam removal and failure analysis.

strength_of_materials	in the bachelor degree program of mechanical engineering, strength of materials and statics are among the most fundamental and applied courses. the use of experiments and simulations in order to improve the quality of learning these subjects cannot be overstated. in strength of materials the analysis of pure bending and transverse loading are two important objectives. the similarities and the differences of the behavior of a structure to these types of loadings should be understood thoroughly. these behaviors are similar in terms of generating bending stresses; but they are different when it comes to producing shear stresses. during teaching strength of materials for many years, the second author has experienced that many students have problem in differentiating these phenomena. the problem is that students obviously cannot see the different values of internal forces and stresses in these cases. these concepts have been usually taught in lectures using diagrams, formulas and textbooks. this method can be improved by giving students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and to use cad software for simulations. such an experience also provides a means for comparing theoretical, simulation and experimental results. in this research, to address the mentioned need, two devices are designed, fabricated and tested. the main question to be answered by using these devices is,. how the transverse loading of a beam compares with the pure bending of the same beam?"" to answer this question, in this research two devices are designed and constructed. each device consists of a beam with two polymethyl methacrylate (pmma, or simply, plexiglas) layers. loads are applied on these beams in order to produce either transverse loading or pure bending moment. for analyzing pure bending, a four-point bending set up is fabricated. for shear force generation in transverse loading, tip load is applied on the cantilever beam. pasta is used as a test specimen to identify in which of these two cases shear force generates. these experiments are augmented with computer simulation and theoretical results and used in classrooms at the university of southern maine (usm). the objective is to facilitate the understanding of a concept that is usually difficult for students to comprehend using traditional teaching methods. also, for using in a statics course, a separate test setup for analyzing the equilibrium of a hinged bar subjected to a tip force is designed and built. the tip force is applied and measured using a spring scale. there are three parameters that can be varied in this device. these are the bar mass and angle as well as the angle of the applied loading. students will use this device in the statics course to explore the concept of the moment of a force as well as to compare theoretical and experimental predictions of the load needed for maintaining the equilibrium of the bar.
polymerase_chain_reaction	representing an important greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (n2o) emission from cultivated land is a hot topic in current climate change research. this study examined the influences of nitrogen fertilisation, temperature and soil moisture on the ammonia monooxygenase subunit a (amoa) gene copy numbers and n2o emission characteristics. the experimental observation of n2o fluxes was based on the static chamber-gas chromatographic method. the ammonia-oxidising bacteria (aob) and ammonia-oxidising archaea (aoa) gene copy numbers in different periods were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the results indicated that rain-fed potato field was a n2o source, and the average annual n2o emission was approximately 0.46 +/- 0.06 kgn(2)o-n/ha/year. n2o emissions increased significantly with increase in fertilisation, temperatures below 19.6 a degrees c and soil volumetric water content under 15%. crop rotation appreciably decreases n2o emissions by 34.4 to 52.4% compared to continuous cropping in rain-fed potato fields. the significant correlation between n2o fluxes and aob copy numbers implied that n2o emissions were primarily controlled by aob in rain-fed potato fields. the research has important theoretical and practical value for understanding n2o emissions from rain-fed dry farmland fields.
materials_engineering	small-scale fixed-bed coal and biomass gasifiers represent an attractive option for distributed combined heat and power generation. as known, gasification phenomena are very complex, involving drying, devolatilization, pyrolysis, heterogeneous and homogenous reactions, with a large number of intermediate and final products. gasification processes are also influenced by reaction kinetics and fluid-dynamical effects, such as temperature and concentration gradients. for this reason, simulation models are able to predict gasifiers performance under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium only if the gasification process takes place at a known temperature and the reaction time is lower than the reactants residence time. as a consequence, for fixed-bed gasifiers equilibrium models must consider drying and devolatilization taking place at lower temperature in the heat transfer zone, where solid feed is heated by syngas. therefore, moisture and volatiles are not involved in the gasification reactions since they are released before reaching the reaction zone. several models based on steady-state and one-dimensional representations have been developed to reproduce gasification processes in fixed-bed reactors. these models have been found adequate to provide information for engineering design and process optimization. in this framework a steady-state simulation model has been developed at the department of mechanical chemical and materials engineering (dimcm) of the university of cagliari by using the aspen plus computer code for predicting performance of small-scale up-draft fixed-bed coal gasifiers. the model can be used to evaluate the mass and energy balance in each zone of the gasifier and the main characteristics of the syngas produced by the gasification process (composition, mass flow, temperature, heating value, etc.). this paper describes the model and presents the main results of a parametric analysis, which shows how the gasification process is influenced by the main operating parameters. moreover, the results of the model have been compared with the experimental results of an up-draft gasifier fed with an lignite from alaska. the above-mentioned gasifier is part of a pilot gasification and gas treatment plant built at the sotacarbo research centre in sardinia, italy. the comparison shows that the model well represents the performance of the pilot-scale unit.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the processes of yeast selection for using as wine fermentation starters have revealed a great phenotypic diversity both at interspecific and intraspecific level, which is explained by a corresponding genetic variation among different yeast isolates. thus, the mechanisms involved in promoting these genetic changes are the main engine generating yeast biodiversity. currently, an important task to understand biodiversity, population structure and evolutionary history of wine yeasts is the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in yeast adaptation to wine fermentation, and on remodeling the genomic features of wine yeast, unconsciously selected since the advent of winemaking. moreover, the availability of rapid and simple molecular techniques that show genetic polymorphisms at species and strain levels have enabled the study of yeast diversity during wine fermentation. this review will summarize the mechanisms involved in generating genetic polymorphisms in yeasts, the molecular methods used to unveil genetic variation, and the utility of these polymorphisms to differentiate strains, populations, and species in order to infer the evolutionary history and the adaptive evolution of wine yeasts, and to identify their influence on their biotechnological and sensorial properties.
genetics	genetic variation lays the foundation for diversity and enables humans to adapt to changing environments. the order of the nucleotides adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine on the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) molecules of the nuclear chromosomes and mitochondrial dna (mtdna) plays an important role in normal cell division, tissue development, and reproduction but is susceptible to alteration from a large number of random, inherited, or environmental events. variations can range from a change in a single nucleotide to duplication of entire chromosomes. single nucleotide polymorphisms are the major source of human heterogeneity. other variations that can alter phenotypes and adversely impact growth, development, and health include copy number variations, aneuploidies, and structural alterations such as deletions, translocations, inversions, duplications, insertions, or mutations in mtdna. in addition, dna rearrangements in somatic cells underlie the uncontrolled cell growth found in cancer. this article explores the mechanisms by which variations in dna arise and the impact those changes can have on human health.
materials_engineering	a group of teachers of materials engineering degree belongs to the organizing committee of next national conference on composite materials spain that will be held in rey juan carlos university (madrid, spain) in 2015. the objective of this new ects experience is to involve twenty students of the fourth year in the organization and development of the conference. each activity will be worth up to 2 ects in the rey juan carlos university. the proposed activities are related to two subjects that belong to composite materials discipline: "" composite materials"" (third year) and "" manufacturing of composite materials"" (fourth year). the six activities are the following: 1) review of the proceedings submitted by the participants of the conference; 2) design a poster based on the composite materials manufacturing techniques at the labs of rey juan carlos university; 3) student stand; 4) explanation of a conference poster by a student; 5) proofreading and layout of the conference proceedings; and 6) participation of the students in the organization of the conference. for example, in the first activity the students will review some papers which will have been revised previously by the teachers who will have made modifications to insert errors that the students should detect. the modifications will be related to the order of magnitude and units of the physical properties of the materials, scale and axis of the graphs, conditions of manufacturing processes, etc. the review activity will give to the students the opportunity of develop the general competences of critical reasoning, ability to apply the knowledge to the practice, etc., and the specific ones related to composite materials. besides, it will be a good experience for the students to attend this conference. the conferences will be related to the last advances in composite materials and the more relevant companies of this sector will be present in two of the plenary sessions and in stands.
southern_blotting	two sisters with inherited, severe platelet dysfunction associated with p2y(12) deficiency displayed a single base pair deletion in their p2y(12) genes (378delc), resulting in a frame-shift and premature truncation of the protein. gl, the son of one of them, displayed mild platelet dysfunction and normal p2y(12) sequence. we hypothesized that the abnormal platelet phenotype of gl is due to haploinsufficiency of his p2y(12) gene. we analyzed genomic dna from the family by southern blotting and real-time (rt) pcr. southern blotting results demonstrated that gl has a single p2y(12) allele, inherited from his father. rt-pcr revealed that gl, his mother and aunt have one single intact p2y(12) allele, while his father has two p2y(12) alleles. the single gl p2y(12) allele contains normal sequence, while his mother and aunt have the 378delc allele. the results of this study support our hypothesis and illustrate the platelet phenotype associated with p2y(12) haploinsufficiency.
fluid_mechanics	in this study, we explore how blood-material interactions and hemodynamics are impacted by rendering a clinical quality 25 mm st. jude medical bileaflet mechanical heart valve (bmhv) superhydrophobic (sh) with the aim of reducing thrombo-embolic complications associated with bmhvs. basic cell adhesion is evaluated to assess blood-material interactions, while hemodynamic performance is analyzed with and without the sh coating. results show that a sh coating with a receding contact angle (ca) of 160a degrees strikingly eliminates platelet and leukocyte adhesion to the surface. alternatively, many platelets attach to and activate on pyrolytic carbon (receding ca = 47), the base material for bmhvs. we further show that the performance index increases by 2.5% for coated valve relative to an uncoated valve, with a maximum possible improved performance of 5%. both valves exhibit instantaneous shear stress below 10 n/m(2) and reynolds shear stress below 100 n/m(2). therefore, a sh bmhv has the potential to relax the requirement for antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug regimens typically required for patients receiving mhvs by minimizing blood-material interactions, while having a minimal impact on hemodynamics. we show for the first time that sh-coated surfaces may be a promising direction to minimize thrombotic complications in complex devices such as heart valves.
fluid_mechanics	displacement ventilation (dv) systems were initially developed as an efficient buoyant pollutant removal strategy for scandinavian industrial halls in the 1970 's. in the following decades these systems started to be used in mechanical cooling of office buildings and auditoriums. designing displacement ventilation systems is more challenging than conventional overhead mixing systems. most dv system designs require simplified modeling tools. existing simplified models of dv were validated using air temperature measurements performed in test cells that cannot reproduce the conditions that exist in large rooms with thermally active boundary conditions. there is a lack of measurements that investigate the performance of dv systems in occupied large rooms. with the goal of reducing this knowledge gap, this paper presents a set of detailed temperature and co2 measurements in two occupied large rooms with recently designed dv systems. the measurements were performed.in two recently refurbished rooms located in lisbon: a large concert hall and an adjacent orchestra rehearsal room. the measurements and subsequent analysis were used to assess the actual performance of large room, state of the art, dv systems. in addition, these measurements were used to determine the modeling error of the three-node dv model implemented in energyplus when simulating large rooms. comparison between simulations and measurements revealed a good agreement: the average simulation error obtained by averaging the error of all measurements in all temperature nodes is 5.9%, with the largest deviation occurring in the floor level node (7.1% approximate to 0.4 degrees c) average simulation error of 5.9% (the average of error of all measurements in all nodes).

internal_combustion_engine	significant high levels of available waste tires in brazil, which reached approximately 473 thousand tons in 2015, offer an attractive potential for their use as fuel in advanced thermal conversion processes. technologies for energetic valorization of waste tires were reviewed and two alternatives based on updraft gasification in a modified reactor design were proposed. first of all, a large-scale updraft gasifier on igcc (integrated gasification combined cycle) was considered for the gasification of the derived fuel from waste tires, capable to produce between 10.8 and 16.1 mj of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. the second alternative considered a small-scale updraft gasifier feeding an internal combustion engine, coupled to an electricity generator for the production of up to 8.2 mj of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. implementation of these technologies will allow energetic valorization of waste tires in brazil, solving their disposal problems, creating jobs, reducing negative disposal environmental impacts in landfills, and increasing distributed generation of electricity.
northern_blotting	an amphioxus cdna, amphigm2ap, encoding gm2 activator protein was isolated from the gut cdna library of branchiostoma belcheri. it is 907 by long, and its longest open reading frame codes for a precursor protein consisting of 242 amino acid residues with a signal peptide of 14 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence includes a conserved domain typical of gm2aps between residues 53 and 224, a single n-linked glycosylation site at position 65 and 8 conserved cysteines. phylogenetic analysis showed that amphigm2ap forms a club together with invertebrate gm2aps, indicating that amphigm2ap is evolutionarily closely related to invertebrate gm2aps rather than vertebrate ones. both northern blotting and in situ hybridization histochemistry analyses revealed a tissue-specific expression pattern of amphigm2ap in adult amphioxus with the strongest expression in the digestive system, which is in contrast to the widespread expression pattern of human, mouse and sheep gm2ap genes. it is suggested that amphigm2ap is possibly involved in the take-in of digested food components like lipid molecules.
polymerase_chain_reaction	pectinolytic bacteria from the genus dickeya (former erwinia chrysanthemi), belonging to dickeya dianthicola and dickeya solani species, are causative agents of blackleg and soft rot diseases in europe. recently, d. solani have been isolated most frequently from potato plants with the symptoms of blackleg and soft rot. d. solani strains were shown to cause more severe disease symptoms on potato plants than d. dianthicola especially at the higher temperature. they are also able to develop blackleg disease from lower inoculum levels. in the presented study we not only compared phenotypic features of fifteen d. solani strains isolated in countries having different climatic conditions, poland, finland and israel, but also we examined three d. dianthicola strains. the comparison was performed to determine the influence of the strain origin and the temperature of incubation on the ability of the strains to macerate potato tissue and on their major virulence factors such as: pectinolytic, cellulolytic and proteolytic activities, siderophore production and motility. polish d. solani strains showed higher activities of cell wall degrading enzymes than the finnish and israeli strains at all the tested temperatures: 18, 27, 37 a degrees c. this observation is correlated with the higher ability of polish d. solani strains to cause soft rot. in addition, d. solani strains exhibited higher activity of the above mentioned enzymes and caused more severe potato tuber maceration in laboratory tests than the tested d. dianthicola strains. the collected results indicate that although d. solani strains from different climatic conditions have identical pulse field gel electrophoresis (pfge) profiles in addition to the same fingerprint profiles obtained by the repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep, eric and box repetitive sequences), they differ in the examined phenotypic features, especially in the activities of pectinolytic, cellulolytic and proteolytic enzymes and their capacity to macerate potato tuber tissue.
cell_biology	signaling mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases i and 2 (erk1/2) is involved in numerous cellular processes. mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (mek1/2) catalyze the phosphorylation of erk1/2, converting it into an active kinase that regulates the expression of numerous genes and cellular processes. inhibitors of mek1/2 have demonstrated preclinical and clinical efficacy in certain cancers and types of cardiomyopathy. we report the synthesis of a novel, allosteric, macrocyclic mek1/2 inhibitor that potently inhibits eric1/2 activity in cultured cells and tissues of mice after systemic administration. mice with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by a lamin a/c gene mutation have abnormally increased cardiac erk1/2 activity. in these mice, this novel mek1/2 inhibitor is well tolerated, improves left ventricular systolic function, decreases left ventricular fibrosis, has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle structure and pathology and prolongs survival. the novel mek1/2 inhibitor described herein may therefore find clinical utility in the treatment of this rare cardiomyopathy, other types of cardiomyopathy and cancers in humans.

genetics	soybean seed oil typically contains 18-20% oleic acid. increasing the content of oleic acid is beneficial for health and biodiesel production. mutations in fad2-1 genes have been reported to increase seed oleic acid content. a subset of 1,037 mutant families from a mutagenized soybean cultivar (cv.) forrest population was screened using reverse genetics (tilling) to identify mutations within fad2 genes. although no fad2 mutants were identified using gel-based tilling, four fad2-1a and one fad2-1b mutants were identified to have high seed oleic acid content using forward genetic screening and subsequent target sequencing. tilling has been successfully used as a non-transgenic reverse genetic approach to identify mutations in genes controlling important agronomic traits. however, this technique presents limitations in traits such as oil composition due to gene copy number and similarities within the soybean genome. in soybean, fad2 are present as two copies, fad2-1 and fad2-2. two fad2-1 members: fad2-1a and fad2-1b; and three fad2-2 members: fad2-2a, fad2-2b, and fad2-2c have been reported. syntenic, phylogenetic, and in silico analysis revealed two additional members constituting the fad2 gene family: gmfad2-2d and gmfad2-2e, located on chromosomes 09 and 15, respectively. they are presumed to have diverged from other fad2-2 members localized on chromosomes 19 (gmfad2-2a and gmfad2-2b) and 03 (gmfad2-2c). this work discusses alternative solutions to the limitations of gel-based tilling in functional genomics due to high copy number and multiple paralogs of the fad2 gene family in soybean.
northern_blotting	background: micrornas (mirnas) are small non-coding rnas that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. sequential cleavage of mirna precursors results in a similar to 22 nucleotide duplex of which one strand, the mature mirna, is typically loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex (risc) while the passenger strand is degraded. very little is known about how genetic variation might affect mirna biogenesis and function. results: we re-sequenced the mir1-1, mir1-2, mir133a1, mir133a2, and mir133b genes, that encode the cardiac-enriched mirnas, mir-1 and mir-133, in 120 individuals with familial atrial fibrillation and identified 10 variants, including a novel 79t >c mir133a2 substitution. this variant lies within the duplex at the 3' end of the mature strand, mir-133a-3p, and is predicted to prevent base-pairing and weaken thermostability at this site, favoring incorporation of the passenger strand, mir-133a-5p, into risc. genomic dna fragments containing mir-133a-2 precursor sequences with 79t and 79c alleles were transfected into hela cells. on northern blotting the 79t allele showed strong expression of mir-133a-3p with weak expression of mir-133a-5p. in contrast, the 79c allele had no effect on mir-133a-3p but there was a significant increase (mean 3.6-fold) in mir-133a-5p levels. deep sequencing of small rna libraries prepared from normal human and murine atria confirmed that nearly all the mature mir-133a was comprised of mir-133a-3p and that levels of mir-133a-5p were very low. a number of isomirs with variations at 5' and 3' ends were identified for both mir-133a-3p and mir-133a-5p, with 2 predominant mir-133a-3p isomirs and one predominant mir-133a-5p isomir. bioinformatics analyses indicate that the major mir-133a-3p and 5p isomirs have numerous predicted target mrnas, only a few of which are in common. conclusions: multiple mir-133a isomirs with potential different mrna target profiles are present in the atrium in humans and mice. we identified a human 79t >c mir133a2 variant that alters mirna processing and results in accumulation of the mir-133a-5p strand that is usually degraded.
polymerase_chain_reaction	chlamydia suis infections are endemic in domestic pigs in europe and can lead to conjunctivitis, pneumonia, enteritis and reproductive failure. currently, the knowledge on the zoonotic potential of c.suis is limited. moreover, the last decades, porcine tetracycline resistant c.suis strains have been isolated, which interfere with treatment of chlamydial infections. in this study, the presence of c.suis was examined on nine belgian pig farms, using chlamydia culture and a c.suis specific real-time pcr in both pigs and farmers. in addition to diagnosis for c.suis, the farmers' samples were examined using a chlamydia trachomatis pcr. additionally, the chlamydia isolates were tested for the presence of the tet(c) resistance gene. c. dna was demonstrated in pigs on all farms, and eight of nine farmers were positive in at least one anatomical site. none of the farmers tested positive for c. trachomatis. chlamydia suis isolates were obtained from pigs of eight farms. nine porcine c.suis isolates possessing a tet(c) gene were retrieved, originating from three farms. moreover, c.suis isolates were identified in three human samples, including one pharyngeal and two rectal samples. these findings suggest further research on the zoonotic transfer of c.suis from pigs to humans is needed.
materials_engineering	three-dimensional core-shell organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells with tunable properties are demonstrated via electropolymerization. air-stable poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (pedot) shells with controlled thicknesses are rapidly coated onto periodic gaas nanopillar arrays conformally, preserving the vertical 3d structure. the properties of the organic layer can be readily tuned in situ, allowing for (1) the lowering of the highest occupied molecular orbital level (vertical bar delta e vertical bar similar to 0.28 ev), leading to the increase of open-circuit voltage (v-oc), and (2) an improvement in pedot conductivity that results in enhanced short-circuit current densities (j(sc)). the incorporation of various anionic dopants in the polymer during the coating process also enables the tailoring of the polymer/semiconductor interface transport properties. systematic tuning of the device properties results in a j(sc) of 13.6 ma cm(-2), v-oc of 0.63 v, peak external quantum efficiency of 58.5%, leading to a power conversion efficiencies of 4.11%.
strength_of_materials	the shock tests of set of metals show that together with well-known dynamic strength-characteristics of material such as dynamic yielding limit and spall strength, the additional characteristics, namely, threshold of structural instability under shock compression, defect of the velocity at the plateau of compressive pulse and particle velocity variance at the mesoscale should be introduced into analysis of dynamic strength of materials. the structural instability threshold registered in uniaxial strain conditions allows the resistance to penetration in tate-alekseevskii equation to be determined. copyright (c) 2016 the authors. published by elsevier b.v.
southern_blotting	using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), the cdna encoding a new isoform of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (bmef2) was cloned from the brain of the strain ""liangguang 2"" of bombyx mori. the open reading frame (orf) of the new isoform shows 12 nucleotides absence of (gcactcacaaag) and three nucleotides mutation to the former bmef2 (genbank no. ab121093). thus, we named it bmef2b (genbank no. ef100967). using the swiss-model prediction server, the 3-d structure of bmef2b was modeled. there are two -turns and three -helixes predicted in bmef2b, with the pattern of -. the bmef2b mrna was detected not only in the central nervous system (cns), including brain, suboesophageal ganglion (sg), thoracic ganglion (tg), and abdominal ganglion (ag), but in the non-neural tissues, such as the midgut (mg), fat body (fb), and epidermis (ep), muscle (ms) and ovary (ov). bmef2b mrna content in the brain was measured using the combined method of quantitative rt-pcr and southern blotting, which kept consistently high from larvae to adults.
materials_engineering	stagnation flow, an import research branch of fluid mechanics, describing the fluid motion near the stagnation region, exists on all solid bodies moving in a fluid. and stagnation point boundary layer flow problems described by partial differential equations have attracted many scholars' attention nowadays. these problems have become difficult and hot in the study of applied mathematics, mechanics and materials engineering. this paper has transformed the governing boundary layer equations into a system of nonlinear differential equations through the similarity transformation, and the analytical approximations of solutions are derived by homotopy analysis method (ham). in addition, the effects of physical factors (such as the slip parameter, magnetic field parameter and reynolds number) on the flow are examed and discussed graphically. they have a great impact on the speed.
hydraulics	in recent years, the validity of embolism quantification methods has been questioned, especially for long-vesseled plants. some studies have suggested that cutting xylem while under tension, even under water, might generate artificial cavitation. accordingly, a rehydration procedure prior to hydraulic measurements has been recommended to avoid this artefact. on the other hand, concerns have been raised that xylem refilling might occur when samples are rehydrated. here, we explore the potential biases affecting embolism quantification for grapevine (vitis vinifera l.) petioles harvested under tension or after xylem relaxation. we employ direct visualization of embolism through x-ray micro-computed tomography (microct) to test for the occurrence of fast refilling (artifactually low per cent loss of conductivity (plc) due to rehydration prior to sample harvest) as well as excision-induced embolism (artifactually high embolism due to air introduction during harvest). additionally, we compared the response functions of both stomatal regulation and xylem embolism to xylem pressure (i-x). short-time (20aeuro...min) xylem tension relaxation prior to the hydraulic measurement resulted in a lower degree of embolism than found in samples harvested under native tensions, and yielded xylem vulnerability curves similar to the ones obtained using direct microct visualization. much longer periods of hydration (overnight) were required before xylem refilling was observed to occur. in field-grown vines, over 85% of stomatal closure occurred at less negative i-x than that required to induce 12% plc. our results demonstrate that relaxation of xylem tension prior to hydraulic measurement allows for the reliable quantification of native embolism in grapevine petioles. furthermore, we find that stomatal regulation is sufficiently conservative to avoid transpiration-induced cavitation. these results suggest that grapevines have evolved a strategy of cavitation resistance, rather than one of cavitation tolerance (diurnal cycles of embolism and repair).
internal_combustion_engine	alternative fuels on internal combustion engine (ice) recently has become an attention due to the concern for environmental protection, and needs on reducing dependency on fossil fuels and meeting the current stringent regulation. alcohol fuel is one of the attractive alternative fuels as it can be produced from renewable resources and is oxygenated. methanol fuel is a well-known alcohol fuel that can be blended at the lower blending ratio with gasoline and produce better engine operation in spark ignition engine. however, there is a problem related to its methanol properties, especially on its energy content and vapour lock characteristics. alcohol with higher carbon number such as iso-butanol has high energy content and is able to displace more petroleum gasoline compared to the methanol-gasoline blended fuel. in this study, the focus on the effect of the iso-butanol additive in the methanol-gasoline fuel of unmodified spark ignition engines. a lower ratio of methanol-gasoline blends (m5) was blended with the isobutanol additive for 5 to 15% with 5% increment compared with base gasoline fuel. tests were conducted at constant load (100%) with a variable of lower engine speed range from 1000 rpm to 2500 rpm. the results indicate that as for engine performance, m5b15 displayed improvement in engine brake power, bte (brake thermal efficiency), and egt (exhaust gas temperature) compared to other blended fuels. nevertheless, there is a higher fuel consumption was recorded for all methanol-gasoline blended fuels with iso-butanol additive compared to base gasoline fuel. in terms of engine emissions, m5b15 gives a significant reduction in co and hc emissions compared to base gasoline fuel. however, the increasing trend projected by nox and co2 emissions had been recorded in all iso-butanol additive in methanol gasoline fuels with m5b15 exerting the highest emissions. it can be concluded that iso-butanol additives are a viable option to be blended with existing lower ratio of methanol-gasoline for spark ignition engine operation as an alternative fuel.

enzymology	in cells, an appreciable part of enzymes is associated with lipid membranes. academic experimental studies of the function of membrane enzymes (e.g., pla(2) representing a prototype for interfacial enzymology) are often focused on the enzyme-vesicle interaction or, more specifically, on conversion of lipid forming the external leaflet of the vesicle membrane. the corresponding kinetics are complicated by many factors inherent to the interfacial physics and chemistry. the understanding of the relative role of such factors and how they should be quantitatively described is still limited. here, we present the mean-field kinetic equations, taking the formation of rafts in the membrane and the product-induced membrane strain into account, and analyze various scenarios of lipid conversion. in particular, we scrutinize the conditions when the kinetics may exhibit a transition from a relatively long latency period to a steady-state regime with fast nearly constant reaction rate. specifically, we discuss the likely role of the pore formation in the external lipid layer in this transition. the latter effect may be caused by the product-induced tensile strain in this layer.

strength_of_materials	in this paper, a unified solution method is presented for the classical beam theory. in strength of materials approach, the geometry, material properties and load system are known and related with the unknowns of forces, moments, slopes and deformations by applying a classical differential analysis in addition to equilibrium, constitutive, and kinematic laws. all these relations are expressed in a unified formulation for the classical beam theory. in the special case of simple beams, a system of four linear ordinary differential equations of first order represents the general mechanical behaviour of a straight beam. these equations are solved using the numerical differential quadrature method (dqm). the application of dqm has the advantages of mathematical consistency and conceptual simplicity. the numerical procedure is simple and gives clear understanding. this systematic way of obtaining influence line, bending moment, shear force diagrams and deformed shape for the beams with geometric and load discontinuities has been discussed in this paper. buckling loads and natural frequencies of any beam prismatic or non-prismatic with any type of support conditions can be evaluated with ease.
human_metabolism	modern high-throughput techniques offer immense opportunities to investigate whole-systems behavior, such as those underlying human diseases. however, the complexity of the data presents challenges in interpretation, and new avenues are needed to address the complexity of both diseases and data. constraint-based modeling is one formalism applied in systems biology. it relies on a genome-scale reconstruction that captures extensive biochemical knowledge regarding an organism. the human genome-scale metabolic reconstruction is increasingly used to understand normal cellular and disease states because metabolism is an important factor in many human diseases. the application of human genome-scale reconstruction ranges from mere querying of the model as a knowledge base to studies that take advantage of the model 's topology and, most notably, to functional predictions based on cell-and condition-specific metabolic models built based on omics data. an increasing number and diversity of biomedical questions are being addressed using constraint-based modeling and metabolic models. one of the most successful biomedical applications to date is cancer metabolism, but constraint-based modeling also holds great potential for inborn errors of metabolism or obesity. in addition, it offers great prospects for individualized approaches to diagnostics and the design of disease prevention and intervention strategies. metabolic models support this endeavor by providing easy access to complex high-throughput datasets. personalized metabolic models have been introduced. finally, constraint-based modeling can be used to model whole-body metabolism, which will enable the elucidation of metabolic interactions between organs and disturbances of these interactions as either causes or consequence of metabolic diseases. this chapter introduces constraint-based modeling and describes some of its contributions to systems biomedicine.
hydraulics	nitrogen (n) deposition is expected to have great impact on forest ecosystems by affecting many aspects of plant environmental interactions, one of which involves its influences on plant water relations through modifications of plant hydraulic architecture. however, there is a surprising lack of integrative study on tree hydraulic architecture responses to n deposition, especially at the whole-plant level. in the present study, we used a 5-year n addition experiment to simulate the effects of six different levels of n deposition (20-120 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) on growth and whole-plant hydraulic conductance of a dominant tree species (fraxinus mandshurica rupr.) from the typical temperate forest of ne china. the results showed that alleviation of n limitation by moderate concentrations of fertilization (20-80 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) promoted plant growth, but further n additions on top of the threshold level showed negative effects on plant growth. growth responses of f mandshurica seedlings to n addition of different concentrations were accompanied by corresponding changes in whole-plant hydraulic conductance: higher growth rate was accompanied by reduced whole-plant hydraulic conductance (k-plant) and higher leaf water-use efficiency. a detailed analysis on hydraulic conductance of different components of the whole-plant water transport pathway revealed that changes in root and leaf hydraulic conductance, rather than that of the stem, were responsible for k-plant responses to n fertilization. both plant growth and hydraulic architecture responses to increasing levels of n addition were not linear, i.e., the correlation between measured parameters and n availability exhibited bell-shaped curves with peak values observed at medium levels of n fertilization. changes in hydraulic architecture in response to fertilization found in the present study may represent an important underlying mechanism for the commonly observed changes in water-related tree performances in response to n deposition.
human_metabolism	in pediatric age and particularly in newborn infants the drug efficacy and safety are influenced by the growth and development on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (adme). thanks to the fast development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, the drug therapy promises to be adapted to the genetic profile of the individual, reducing considerably the side effects of drugs and increasing their efficacy. interindividual variability in drug response is well known in both adults and children. such a variability is multifactorial considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. drug distribution in the neonate is influenced by a variety of age-dependent factors as a total body water content and distribution variations, role of drug transporters, blood/tissue protein binding, blood and tissue ph and perfusion. the development of enzymes involved in human metabolism were classified in 3 categories: 1) those expressed during the whole or part of the fetal period, but silenced or expressed at low levels within 1-2 years after birth; 2) those expressed at relatively constant levels throughout fetal development, but increased to some extent postnatally; and 3) those whose onset of expression can occur in the third trimester, but substantial increase is noted in the first 1-2 years after birth. besides this intrinsic aspects influencing pharmacokinetics during the neonatal period there are other important events such as inborn or acquired diseases, environment and finally pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. thousands of deaths every years are caused by fatal drug reactions; among the potential causes there are not only the severity of the disease being treated, drug interactions, nutritional status, renal and liver functions, but also the inherited differences in drug metabolism and genetic polymorphism. adverse drug reactions (adrs) among pediatric patients have been shown to be three times more frequent than in adults. on august 2010 the national institute of child health and human development (nichd) addressed patient safety issues in the nicu, recognizing that to understand and prevent adverse events, systematic research and education in safety issues needed. from all these concepts in terms of adme, pharmacogenetics (relative to a single gene) and pharmacogenomics (relative to many genes) it is becoming more evident the perspective of the new concept of individualized medicine. the goal of this should be to identify which group of patients responds positively, which patients are nonresponders and who experiences adverse reaction for the same drug and dose. the interindividual variability in response to any drug is mostly dependent on dna sequence variations across the human genome, the haplotype map (hapmap). at present there is still a big distance beween the knowledge in genetic and the practical application to model the drug profile to the genetic/genomic profile of the single patient. in the neonatal period the effects of growth in the pharmacodynamic, processes can help optimizing the dosage of neonatal frequently used medicines, thereby, minimizing their toxicity and increasing their efficacy. it should be useful to create accurate dosage adjustments according to the week of development.
human_metabolism	traditionally, the choice of which candidate compounds to take forward into development has been based on pre-clinical data. however, lack of predictivity of the human clinical situation in the models used has led to poor decision-making, and the later in the development process that such mistakes are realised, the more costly and time-consuming it is to correct them. furthermore, compounds that may have made perfectly good drugs, have been dropped due to poor pharmacokinetics; in animal models. accelerator mass spectrometry (ams) is an ultra-sensitive detection technique that can be used to quantify carbon-14. by administering very small amounts of (14)c-labelled compounds, ams can be used to obtain human clinical data very early in the drug development process. such studies: a) can be helpful in understanding human pharmacokinetics using microdosing; b) can provide early human metabolism information, to validate the choice of animal species used in pre-clinical safety testing and identify unique or disproportionate human metabolites during phase 1; and c) can provide fundamental human pharmacokinetic data, including absolute bioavailability, by facilitating a scientifically optimal and cost-effective study design. the provision of these clinical insights at the earliest possible opportunity can lead to improved decision-making, and therefore can reduce the time and cost involved in the drug development process.
molecular_biology	prophenoloxidase (propo) cascade is a principal defense system in crustaceans, which consists of a variety of pattern recognition proteins (lipopolysaccharide and beta-glucan-binding protein [beta-gbp], beta-gbp, and beta-glucan recognition protein), proteases (serine protease), and protease inhibitors (alpha 2-macroglobulin and pacifastin) to regulate the protection mechanism in crustaceans. in the prophneoloxidase pathway, the protein-protein interactions (ppis) and other immune-related analyses still have not been reported. moreover, the structural features of propo cascade proteins have not yet been reported, hence we constructed the three-dimensional structural features for all propo pathway proteins. their ppis were studied through an in silico approach. laminarin has been identified as a triggering activator and it showed energetic binding with homology modeled beta-gbp and activated the beta-gbp, followed by the protein-protein complex formation leading to phenoloxidase synthesis. these findings provided a novel view of the propo mechanism and enhanced our knowledge of the innate immune system in crustaceans via computation. in conclusion, we propose a combined experimental and computational approach to analyze the mechanism of propo cascade proteins.

genetics	blepharospasm (sometimes called ""benign essential blepharospasm,"" beb) is one of the most common focal dystonias. it involves involuntary eyelid spasms, eye closure, and increased blinking. despite the success of botulinum toxin injections and, in some cases, pharmacologic or surgical interventions, beb treatments are not completely efficacious and only symptomatic. we could develop principled strategies for preventing and reversing the disease if we knew the pathogenesis of primary beb. the objective of this study was to develop a conceptual framework and dynamic circuit hypothesis for the pathogenesis of beb. the framework extends our overarching theory for the multifactorial pathogenesis of focal dystonias (peterson et al., 2010) to incorporate a two-hit rodent model specifically of beb (schicatano et al., 1997). we incorporate in the framework three features critical to cranial motor control: (1) the joint influence of motor cortical regions and direct descending projections from one of the basal ganglia output nuclei, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, on brainstem motor nuclei, (2) nested loops composed of the trigeminal blink reflex arc and the long sensorimotor loop fromtrigeminal nucleus through thalamus to somatosensory cortex back through basal ganglia to the same brainstem nuclei modulating the reflex arc, and (3) abnormalities in the basal ganglia dopamine system that provide a sensorimotor learning substrate which, when combined with patterns of increased blinking, leads to abnormal sensorimotor mappings manifest as beb. the framework explains experimental data on the trigeminal reflex blink excitability (trbe) from schicatano et al. and makes predictions that can be tested in new experimental animal models based on emerging genetics in dystonia, including the recently characterized striatal-specific d1r dopamine transduction alterations caused by the gnal mutation. more broadly, the model will provide a guide for future efforts to mechanistically link multiple factors in the pathogenesis of beb and facilitate simulations of how exogenous manipulations of the pathogenic factors could ultimately be used to prevent and reverse the disorder.
thermodynamics	density and viscosity are essential physical properties and need to be well-known in chemical engineering design as well as process optimization. to expand the potential application of ils, it is important to know the properties of ils mixtures for their widely used. in this work, the values of density and dynamic viscosity of aqueous [c(3)py][dca] with the molarity range from (0.0500 to 1.0096) mol kg(-1) were measured at t = (288.15-318.15) k. in terms of jones-dole equation, the viscosity b-coefficients with large positive value and db/dr < 0 were obtained and it implied that the ionic liquid is water-structure-making. the values of the contribution per mole of the solute to the free energy of activation for viscous flow of the solution, delta m(2)(not equal 0), were obtained on the basis of the feakins' theory. the relationship between delta mu(not equal 0)(2) and temperature is linear so that standard molar activation entropy delta s-2(not equal 0) and enthalpy, delta h-2(not equal 0), were obtained. at constant molality, delta h-2(not equal 0) is a temperature-independent constant so that implies the activation process of the solute for viscous flow of aqueous [c(3)py][dca] is an isocoulombic reaction. according to eyring 's theory, a semi-empirical method to predict the viscosity of aqueous [c(3)py][dca] was put forward and the predicted values are all most the same with corresponding experimental ones.

southern_blotting	the popular view that plant mitochondrial genome evolves slowly in sequence has been recently challenged by the extraordinarily high substitution rates of mtdna documented mainly from several angiosperm genera, but high substitution rate acceleration accompanied with great length variation has been very rarely reported in plant mitochondrial genes. here, we studied evolution of the mitochondrial rps3 gene that encodes the ribosomal small subunit protein 3 and found a dramatically high variation in both length and sequence of an exon region of it in conifer ii. a sequence comparison between cdna and genomic dna showed that there are no rna editing sites in the conifer ii rps3 gene. southern blotting analyses of the total dna and mtdna, together with the real-time pcr analysis, showed that rps3 exists as a single mitochondrial locus in gymnosperms. it is very likely that the conifer ii rps3 gene has experienced retroprocessing, i.e., the re-integration of its cdna into the mitochondrial genome, followed by an evolutionary acceleration due to the intron loss. in addition, the phylogenetic analysis of rps3 supports the sister relationship between conifers and gnetales. in particular, the monophyly of conifer ii is strongly supported by the shared loss of two rps3 introns. our results also indicate that the mitochondrial gene tree would be affected in topology when the ""edited"" paralogs are analyzed together with their genomic sequences.

fluid_mechanics	finding the critical factors that influence the pressure during pumping of concrete has been investigated for years. from fluid mechanics, the relationship between pressure and flow rate, radius or viscosity is known. in the practical guidelines for pumping of conventional vibrated concrete (cvc) the viscosity term is replaced by the concrete yield stress. however, recently, the influence of viscosity on pumping pressure has been reevaluated for self-consolidating concrete (scc). in this paper, the influence of concrete rheology, tribology, flow rate and pipe radius on pumping pressure are discussed, based on full-scale pumping tests. the concrete mixtures varied from pumpable cvc to segregating scc. the influence of flow rate and viscosity on pumping of concrete has been confirmed. it is also shown that with a 20% decrease in pipe radius (from 125 to 100 mm), the pumping pressure can be roughly doubled. an increase in yield stress also increases the pumping pressure, but its influence is only visible when the viscosity is approximately constant. the total flow resistance in the tribometer also appears to correlate well with the pumping pressure, proving that the developed tribometer mimics quite well the flow of concrete in a pipe.

computer-aided_design	the recent tau computer-aided design (cad) contest has aimed to seek novel ideas for accurate and fast common path pessimism removal (cppr). unnecessary pessimism forces the static timing analysis tool to report worse violation than the true timing properties owned by physical circuits, thereby misleading signoff timing into a lower clock frequency at which circuits can operate than actual silicon implementations. therefore, we introduce in this paper ui-timer 1.0, a powerful cppr algorithm which achieves high accuracy and ultrafast runtime. unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit path search, ui-timer 1.0 proves that by implicit path representation the amount of search effort can be significantly reduced. our timer is superior in both space and time saving, from which memory storage and important timing quantities are available in constant space and constant time per path during the search. experimental results on industrial benchmarks released from tau 2014 cad contest have justified that ui-timer 1.0 achieved the best result in terms of accuracy and runtime over existing cppr algorithms.
machine_design	this paper proposes a method to the model constraints from different models to run an optimization over models with different granularities. through machine learning, the proposed method has proven to be able to accurately map the constraints and minimize the number of call to the model. it handles both continuous and discrete variables and mixes design rules to statistic approach to create a surrogate of the model.
molecular_biology	no-mediated alternative pathway plays an important role in protecting wheat seedlings against drought stress through dissipating excessive reducing equivalents generated by photosynthesis. alternative pathway (ap) has been proven to be involved in responses to various stresses. however, the mechanisms of ap in defense response to drought stress are still lacking. the aims of this work are to investigate the role of ap in drought tolerance and how ap is induced under drought stress using two wheat cultivars with different drought tolerance. our results showed that longchun22 cultivar is more tolerant to drought than 98sn146 cultivar. seedlings exposed to drought led to a significant increase in ap, and it increased more in longchun22. furthermore, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (fv/fm, i broken vertical bar psii, qp) decreased significantly in drought-treated seedlings, especially in 98sn146, indicating that photoinhibition occurred under drought stress. pretreatment with sham, the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle activity and photosynthetic efficiency were further inhibited in drought-treated seedlings, resulting in more serious oxidative damage as indicated by higher levels of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide. moreover, no modulated ap under drought stress by increasing aox1a expression and pyruvate content. taken together, these results indicate that no-mediated ap is involved in optimizing photosynthesis under drought stress by avoiding the over-reduction of photosynthetic electron transport chain, thus reducing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage in wheat leaves.
immunology	c1q is the target recognition sequence of the classical complement pathway and a major link that connects innate and acquired immunity. in this study, a c1qdc homolog, hcc1qdc5, from the triangle-shell pearl mussel (hyriopsis cumingii) was identified. the complete nucleotide sequence of hcc1qdc5 cdna consists of a 5'-untranslated terminal region (utr) of 123 bp, a 3'-utr of 105 bp with a poly(a) tail, and an open reading frame (orf) of 1344 bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 447 amino acids. hcc1qdc5 contains a signal peptide and three typical c1q domains. the hcc1qdc5 gene was expressed in all tested tissues, with the highest expression in the. mantle. staphylococcus aureus or vibrio parahaemolyticus infection increased the mrna transcript levels of hcc1qdc5 in the hepatopancreas and mantle. the recombinant hcc1qdc5 protein could bind to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as to different pamps (lps and pgn). rnai results showed that hcc1qdc5 was involved in v. parahaemolyticus-induced hctnf and hcwap expression. the combined results demonstrated that hcc1qdc5 participates in the innate immunity of h. cumingii.

polymerase_chain_reaction	understanding pathogenic variation in plant pathogen populations is key for the development and use of host resistance for managing verticillium wilt diseases. a highly virulent defoliating (d) pathotype in verticillium dahliae has previously been shown to occur only in one clonal lineage (lineage 1a). by contrast, no clear association has yet been shown for race 1 with clonal lineages. race 1 carries the effector gene ave1 and is avirulent on hosts that carry resistance gene ve1 or its homologues. the hypothesis tested was that race 1 arose once in a single clonal lineage, which might be expected if v. dahliae acquired ave1 by horizontal gene transfer from plants, as hypothesized previously. in a diverse sample of 195 v. dahliae isolates from nine clonal lineages, all race 1 isolates were present only in lineage 2a. conversely, all lineage 2a isolates displayed the race 1 phenotype. moreover, 900-bp nucleotide sequences from ave1 were identical among 27 lineage 2a isolates and identical to sequences from other v. dahliae race 1 isolates in genbank. the finding of race 1 in a single clonal lineage, with identical ave1 sequences, is consistent with the hypothesis that race 1 arose once in v. dahliae. molecular markers and virulence assays also confirmed the well-established finding that the d pathotype is found only in lineage 1a. pathogenicity assays indicated that cotton and olive isolates of the d pathotype (lineage 1a) were highly virulent on cotton and olive, but had low virulence on tomato.
enzymology	progesterone, estrogens, androgens and glucocorticoids are involved in pregnancy from implantation to parturition. their biosynthesis and their metabolism result from complex pathways involving the fetus, the placenta and the mother. the absence of expression of some steroidogenic enzymes as cyp17 in placenta and in adrenal fetal zone and the better determination of the onset and variation of others especially hsd3b2 during the pregnancy explain the production of the steroid hormones. moreover the consequences of some disorders of steroidogenesis (especially aromatase, por, cyp11a1 and 21-hydroxylase deficiencies) in fetus and mother during the pregnancy have permit to elucidate these complex pathways. this better knowledge of steroid hormones production associated with their dosages in maternal plasma/urine or amniotic fluid using new specific assays as lc-ms ms could facilitate the follow-up of normal and pathological pregnancies. moreover, these advances should be a basis to evaluate the impact of multiple pathologies of the pregnancy and pharmacologic and xenobiotic consequences on their metabolism.

fluid_mechanics	physical examination of any swelling is the first step in making a diagnosis. many a times we see a patient with a spherical swelling, which is usually a cyst. the interpretation of physical signs should be based on sound principles of physics. in the present paper, we explain physical characteristics of a swelling (cyst) using principles of fluid mechanics.
immunology	background: adding a long-acting beta(2)-agonist (laba) to inhaled corticosteroids (ics) using a fixed-dose combination (fdc) inhaler is the uk guideline recommendation for children aged more than 4 years with uncontrolled asthma. the evidence of benefit of adding an fdc inhaler over a separate laba inhaler is limited. objective: the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a laba added as an fdc inhaler, and as a separate inhaler, in children with uncontrolled asthma. methods: two uk primary care databases were used to create a matched cohort study with a 2-year follow-up period. we included children prescribed their first step-up from ics monotherapy. two cohorts were formed for children receiving an add-on laba as an fdc inhaler, or a separate laba inhaler. matching variables and confounders were identified by comparing characteristics during a baseline year of follow-up. outcomes were examined during the subsequent year. the primary outcome was an adjusted odds ratio for overall asthma control (defined as follows: no asthma-related hospital admission or emergency room visit, prescription for oral corticosteroids or antibiotic with evidence of respiratory consultation, and <= 2 puffs of short-acting bagonist daily). results: the final study consisted of 1330 children in each cohort (mean age 9 years; 59% male). in the separate icsdlaba cohort, the odds of achieving overall asthma control were lower (adjusted odds ratio, 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.91]; p =.001) compared with the fdc cohort. conclusion: the study demonstrates a small but significant benefit in achieving asthma control from an add-on laba as an fdc, compared with a separate inhaler and this supports current guideline recommendations.

cell_biology	the packaging of eukaryotic dna into nucleosomes, and the organisation of these nucleosomes into chromatin, plays a critical role in regulating all dna-associated processes. chromodomain helicase dna-binding protein 1 (chd1) is an atp-dependent chromatin remodelling protein that is conserved throughout eukaryotes and has an ability to assemble and organise nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo. this activity is involved in the regulation of transcription and is implicated in mammalian development and stem cell biology. chd1 is classically depicted as possessing a pair of tandem chromodomains that directly precede a core catalytic helicase-like domain that is then followed by a sant-slide dna-binding domain. here, we have identified an additional conserved domain c-terminal to the sant-slide domain and determined its structure by multidimensional heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy. we have termed this domain the chd1 helical c-terminal (chct) domain as it is comprised of five a-helices arranged in a variant helical bundle topology. chct has a conserved, positively charged surface and is able to bind dna and nucleosomes. in addition, we have identified another group of proteins, the as yet uncharacterised c17orf64 proteins, as also containing a conserved chct domain. our data provide new structural insights into the chd1 enzyme family.

enzymology	using a large-scale ""genomic enzymology"" approach, we (i) assigned novel atp-dependent four-carbon acid sugar kinase functions to members of the duf1537 protein family (domain of unknown function; pfam families pf07005 and pf17042) and (ii) discovered novel catabolic pathways for d-threonate, l-threonate, and d-erythronate. the experimentally determined ligand specificities of several solute binding proteins (sbps) for trap (tripartite atp-independent permease) transporters for four-carbon acids, including d-erythronate and l-erythronate, were used to constrain the substrates for the catabolic pathways that degrade the sbp ligands to intermediates in central carbon metabolism. sequence similarity networks and genome neighborhood networks were used to identify the enzyme components of the pathways. conserved genome neighborhoods encoded sbps as well as permease components of the trap transporters, members of the duf1537 family, and a member of the 4-hydroxy-l-threonine 4-phosphate dehydrogenase (pdxa) oxidative decarboxylase, class ii aldolase, or ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, large subunit (rubisco) superfamily. because the characterized substrates of members of the pdxa, class ii aldolase, and rubisco superfamilies are phosphorylated, we postulated that the members of the duf1537 family are novel atp-dependent kinases that participate in catabolic pathways for four-carbon acid sugars. we determined that (i) the duf1537/pdxa pair participates in a pathway for the conversion of d-threonate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and co2 and (ii) the duf1537/class ii aldolase pair participates in pathways for the conversion of d-erythronate and l-threonate (epimers at carbon-3) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and co2. the physiological importance of these pathways was demonstrated in vivo by phenotypic and genetic analyses.
hydraulics	an accurate analysis of the flow transient is very important in safety evaluation of a nuclear power plant. in this study, analysis of a vvvver-1000 reactor is investigated. in order to perform this analysis, a model is developed to simulate the coupled kinetics and thermal-hydraulics of the reactor with a simple and accurate numerical algorithm. for thermal-hydraulic calculations, the four-equation drift-flux model is applied. based on a multi-channel approach, core is divided into some regions. each region has different characteristics as represented in a single fuel pin with its associated coolant channel. to obtain the core power distribution, point kinetic equations with different feedback effects are utilized. the appropriate initial and boundary conditions are considered and two situations of decreasing the coolant flow rate in a protected and unprotected core are analyzed. in addition to analysis of normal operation condition, a full range of thermal-hydraulic parameters is obtained for transients too. finally, the data obtained from the model are compared with the calculations conducted using relap5/mod3 code and bushehr nuclear power plant data. it is shown that the model can provide accurate predictions for both steady-state and transient conditions.
computer-aided_design	purpose of reviewmultiple disease processes, including neoplasia, trauma, and medication side-effects, necessitate segmental resection and subsequent reconstruction of the mandible. as surgical techniques have advanced, several technologies have been developed with the potential to significantly transform a surgeon 's approach to the restoration of mandibular continuity. the purpose of this review is to highlight many of these relatively newer tools and discuss their evolving role in mandibular reconstruction.recent findingsseveral contemporary studies have documented the application of different approaches and modifications to mandibular reconstruction - including computer-aided design or computer-aided modeling, contemporary plating systems, osseointegrated implants, and various modifications to existing osseocutaneous free tissue transfer options - and have reported relatively high success rates.summaryin discussing these reports, we present a survey of current and developing technologies in the field of mandibular reconstruction and aim to provide sufficient context for the gradual integration of these techniques into practice.
hydraulics	hydraulic units are often linked to ecological habitat through geomorphic structure, and a better understanding of the turbulent characteristics of the units is needed. our work examined the near-bed turbulent structure of runs and glides in a restored river and investigated the physical characteristics that influenced the near-bed hydraulics in these units. the research was completed in three restored reaches and one reference reach at the virginia tech stream research, education, and management laboratory. the laboratory is unique because three different restoration treatments were applied contiguously along a stream, and the restoration practices ranged from passive to active. the passive reach included cattle exclusion, while the active reaches included cattle exclusion as well as vegetation plantings, bank sloping and the construction of inset floodplains. three-dimensional velocities were measured near the channel bed in run and glide biotopes within the three restored reaches, as well as an upstream reference reach. the velocities were utilized to analyse and compare near-bed turbulent structure across the reaches. while the restoration activities did not address the channel bed directly, differences in physical structure of the two physical biotopes were observed among restoration treatments, likely because of changes in bank shape and roughness due to vegetation differences. differences between reference and restored reaches were still evident approximately 3years after cattle exclusion and construction activities. few differences were observed in the hydraulic structure between runs and glides, and the near-bed flow structure in both runs and glides was related to local roughness. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
molecular_biology	a powerful double-hairpin molecular beacon (dhmb) was developed for cancer-related kras gene detection based on the one-to-two stoichiometry. during target dna detection, dhmb can execute signal transduction even if no any exogenous element is involved. unlike the conventional molecular beacon based on the one-to-one interaction, one target dna not only hybridizes with one dhmb and opens its hairpin but also promotes the interaction between two dhmbs, causing the separation of two fluorophores from quenchers. this leads to an enhanced fluorescence signal. as a result, the target kras gene is able to be detected within a wide dynamic range from 0.05 to 200 nm with the detection limit of 50 pm, indicating a dramatic improvement compared with traditional molecular beacons. moreover, the point mutations existing in target dnas can be easily screened. the potential application for target species in real samples was indicated by the analysis of pcr amplicons of dnas from the dna extracted from sw620 cell. besides becoming a promising candidate probe for molecular biology research and clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases, the dhmb is expected to provide a significant insight into the design of dna probe-based homogenous sensing systems.
hydraulics	it is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting shoots after fire in chaparral shrublands. by contrast, little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. we hypothesized that vascular traits, both functional and structural, would also shift in order to support this heightened level of gas exchange and growth. we examined stem xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (k-s) and resistance to cavitation (p-50) for eight chaparral shrub species as well as several potential xylem structural determinants of hydraulic function and compared established unburned plants and co-occurring post-fire resprouting plants. unburned plants were generally more resistant to cavitation than resprouting plants, but the two groups did not differ in k-s. resprouting plants had altered vessel structure compared with unburned plants, with resprouting plants having both wider diameter vessels and higher inter-vessel pit density. for biomechanics, unburned plants had both stronger and denser stem xylem tissue than resprouting plants. shifts in hydraulic structure and function resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration. the interaction between time since disturbance (i.e. resprouting versus established stands) and drought may complicate attempts to predict mortality risk of resprouting plants. it is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting plants after fire in chaparral shrublands, but little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. the ecophysiology of eight species of chaparral shrubs was compared between resprouting plants and adjacent unburned plants. resprouting plants varied from unburned plants in their hydraulics, xylem structure and biomechanics. the observed shifts resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration than unburned plants and demonstrate potential variability of plants in their hydraulic physiology depending on disturbance recovery state.
internal_combustion_engine	electric vehicles (ev), as a promising way to reduce the greenhouse effect, have been researched extensively. with improvements in the areas of power electrics, energy storage and support, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (phev) provides competitive driving range and fuel economy compared to the internal combustion engine vehicle (icev). operating with optimised control strategies or utilising the concept of the energy management system (ems), the efficiency of the phev could be significantly improved. in this review paper, the operating process of the various types of evs will be explained. battery technology and supercapacitor technology will also be discussed as a possibility to increase the energy capacity of phev.
thermodynamics	the advancement in micro/nanotechnologies has been continuously providing possibilities for inventing novel biochemical sensors. however, variations in the transducer type can cause different sensing results due to the differences in their mechanisms of analyzing biomolecular interactions. in this work, we focused on the comparative analysis of static and non-static assays for molecular interactions using on-chip integrated extended-gate field effect transistor (egfet) as a static sensing interface and solidly mounted resonator (smr) as a non-static sensing interface. analysis of polyelectrolytes (pets) surface assembly and antigen-antibody interaction using the two types of biochemical sensors presented consistent and complementary sets of information. meanwhile, due to the difference in their operating mechanisms, variations on the detection efficiency, kinetics and thermodynamics were observed. our results highlighted the critical dependence of signal detection on biochemical sensors' operating mechanisms and provided a valuable guidance for static and non-static assays for biomolecular detections.

human_metabolism	the human population continues to grow exponentially in the fast developing and most populated countries, whereas in western europe it is getting older and older each year. this inevitably raises the demand for better and more efficient medical services without increasing the economic burden in the same proportion. to meet these requirements, improvement of medical diagnosis is certainly a key aspect to consider. therefore, we need powerful analytical methodologies able to go deeper and further in the characterization of human metabolism and identification of disease biomarkers and endogenous molecules in body fluids and tissues. the ultimate goal is to have a reliable and early medical diagnosis, mitigating the disease complications as much as possible. microextraction techniques (mets) represent a key step in these analytical methodologies by providing samples in the suitable volumes and purification levels necessary for the characterization of the target analytes. in this aspect, solid-phase microextraction (spme) and, more recently, microextraction by packed sorbent (meps), are powerful sample preparation techniques, characterized by their reduced time of analysis, low solvent consumption, and broad application. moreover, as miniaturized techniques, they can be easily automatized to have a high-throughput performance in the clinical environment. in this review, we explore some of the most interesting meps and spme applications, focusing on recent trends and applications to medical diagnostic, particularly the in vivo and near real time applications.
fluid_mechanics	a piezoelectric unimorph anemovane is proposed and analyzed for measuring precisely variation of wind direction and speed. the proposed anemovane has various advantages, compared with general anemovane. it can detect the wind in all direction, and be fabricated as small one. this anemovane was designed as the shape similar to a sea urchin. we use cantilevers to imitate prickles projected on the sea urchin sphere. if the wind blows, it hit the cantilever and the pressure makes the voltage signal through the piezoelectric unimorph bender. the simulation of the proposed system was performed using the fem software (comsol multiphysics), and the multi-physics analysis (fluid mechanics, mechanics and electrostatics) was executed by considering real boundary conditions. based on fem analysis of the new anemovane with the new structure and control method, the characteristics between the fluid and the piezoelectric unimorph bender was comprehended. the possibility of the proposed anemovane was verified through the fabrication and the experiment.
thermodynamics	a model-independent statistical framework is presented to interpret data from systems where the mean time derivative of positional cross correlation between world lines, a measure of spreading in a quantum geometrical wave function, is measured with a precision smaller than the planck time. the framework provides a general way to constrain possible departures from perfect independence of classical world lines, associated with planck scale bounds on positional information. a parameterized candidate set of possible correlation functions is shown to be consistent with the known causal structure of the classical geometry measured by an apparatus, and the holographic scaling of information suggested by gravity. frequency-domain power spectra are derived that can be compared with interferometer data. simple projections of sensitivity for realistic experimental set-ups suggests that measurements will confirm or rule out a class of planck scale departures from classical geometry.
genetics	purpose of review to outline the roles of sr-b1 and pdzk1 in hepatic selective hdl cholesterol uptake and reverse cholesterol transport and the consequences for atherosclerosis development. recent findings much of our understanding of the physiological roles of sr-b1 and pdzk1 in hdl metabolism and atherosclerosis comes from studies of genetically manipulated mice. these show sr-b1 and pdzk1 play key roles in hdl metabolism and protection against atherosclerosis. the recent identification of rare loss of function mutations in the human scarb1 gene verifies that it plays similar roles in hdl metabolism in humans. other rare mutations in both the human scarb1 and pdzk1 genes remain to be characterized but may have potentially devastating consequences to sr-b1 function. summary identification of carriers of rare mutations in human scarb1 and pdzk1 that impair the function of their gene products and characterization of the effects of these mutations on hdl cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis will add to our understanding of the importance of hdl function and cholesterol flux, as opposed to hdl-cholesterol levels, per se, for protection against cardiovascular disease.
molecular_biology	background: hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna sequence data from thousands of samples are present in the public sequence databases. no publicly available, up-to-date, multiple sequence alignments, containing full-length and subgenomic fragments per genotype, are available. such alignments are useful in many analysis applications, including data-mining and phylogenetic analyses. results: by issuing a query, all hbv sequence data from the genbank public database was downloaded (67,893 sequences). full-length and subgenomic sequences, which were genotyped by the submitters (30,852 sequences), were placed into a multiple sequence alignment, for each genotype (genotype a: 5868 sequences, b: 4630, c: 7820, d: 8300, e: 2043, f: 985, g: 189, h: 108, i: 23), according to the results of offline blast searches against a custom reference library of full-length sequences. further curation was performed to improve the alignment. conclusions: the algorithm described in this paper generates, for each of the nine hbv genotypes, multiple sequence alignments, which contain full-length and subgenomic fragments. the alignments can be updated as new sequences become available in the online public sequence databases. the alignments are available at http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/alignments.
enzymology	a major challenge in enzymology is the need to correlate the dynamic properties of enzymes with, and understand the impact on, their catalytic cycles. this is especially the case with large, multicenter enzymes such as the nitric oxide synthases (noss), where the importance of dynamics has been inferred from a variety of structural, single-molecule, and ensemble spectroscopic approaches but where motions have not been correlated experimentally with mechanistic steps in the reaction cycle. here we take such an approach. using time-resolved spectroscopy employing absorbance and forster resonance energy transfer (fret) and exploiting the properties of a flavin analogue (5-deazaflavin mononucleotide (5-dfmn)) and isotopically labeled nicotinamide coenzymes, we correlate the timing of cam structural changes when bound to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnos) with the nnos catalytic cycle. we show that remodeling of cam occurs early in the electron transfer sequence (fad reduction), not at later points in the reaction cycle (e.g., fmn reduction). conformational changes are tightly correlated with fad reduction kinetics and reflect a transient ""opening"" and then ""closure"" of the bound cam molecule. we infer that displacement of the c-terminal tail on binding nadph and subsequent fad reduction are the likely triggers of conformational change. by combining the use of cofactor/coenzyme analogues and time resolved fret/absorbance spectrophotometry, we show how the reaction cycles of complex enzymes can be simplified, enabling a detailed study of the relationship between protein dynamics and reaction cycle chemistry-an approach that can also be used with other complex multicenter enzymes.
materials_engineering	continuum mechanics-based approximation is too often unsatisfactory for solution of real material problems especially in experimental as well as computational fatigue applications. various methods of classical-deterministic analyses often produce inconclusive or conflicting estimates of the fatigue life of a component. in addition, the classical griffith-irwin-orowan concept that assumed the phenomena based on homeomorphism mathematics cannot be developed any closer to the experimental results anymore. it has already reached its saturation point. this note discusses the fundamental reasons of the limitations of classical fracture mechanics and subsequently predicts alternatives. application of classical fracture mechanics to engineering problems is discussed along with possible alternatives employing probabilistic and fractal fracture mechanics in materials engineering.

southern_blotting	background: oxidative stress (os) may be involved in the neurodegenerative process in alzheimer 's disease (ad). telomeres, the repeated sequences that cap chromosome ends, undergo shortening with each cell division, are sensitive to os, and serve as markers of a cell 's replicative history. telomere length shortening has been reported to relate to os with aging process and aging-associated diseases, but the telomeric changes were not always identical, especially in change of telomere length distribution and subtelomeric methylation. the involvement of an os-associated telomere change in the pathogenesis of ad has been discussed for decades, and the telomere length and telomerase activity were analyzed. however, other telomeric factors, such as the telomere distribution and subtelomeric methylation status, have not yet been analyzed. objective: the subtelomeric methylation status as well as the telomere length were studied in ad with an antioxidant vitamin in terms of os. methods: we measured urinary 8-iso-pgf2 alpha, a lipid-peroxidation product as an os marker, and methylated and non-methylated telomere lengths in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by southern blotting in ad patients before and after vitamin e treatment. results: the level of urinary 8-iso-pgf2 alpha was found to have increased in ad. middle-ranged telomeres (4.4-9.4 kb) increased and the shortest telomeres (<4.4 kb) decreased in ad patients. telomeres were more methylated in both long telomeres and in short telomeres in ad compared with the control. the oral administration of the antioxidant vitamin e in 400 mg/day for 6 months in ad patients partly reversed ad-associated alterations in os marker levels. conclusions: ad patients showed an elevated os marker level, and vitamin e lowered the os level. in comparison with controls, ad patients showed shorter telomere lengths. cells with short and long telomeres bore relatively hypermethylated subtelomeres in ad patients. aging-associated accumulation of cells bearing short telomeres was not observed in ad. these results imply that long telomeres with hypomethylation tend to shorten faster, and cells bearing short telomeres with hypomethylation tend to more easily enter into a senescent state under elevated os stress in ad. however, no significant effect on the altered telomeric profiles in ad patients could be detected after a 6-month administration of vitamin e. copyright (c) 2011 s. karger ag, basel
machine_design	a 2-d magnetizer introduces variation in the flux density (b) across the sample under rotational magnetization. this variation requires additional energy requirements that limits the attainable aspect ratios, flux density levels and stresses the supply. a numerical methodology that accounts for the flux leakage and the eddy currents is proposed to analyze uniformity and variation in b in four 2-d magnetizers. the analysis was done beyond the knee of the magnetization curve. numerical results will show that round magnetizers can mitigate the variation of the square magnetizer by over 92%, by making the mmf more sinusoidal and equalizing the reluctance along the airgap. in addition, deeper yokes minimized the variation by about 50% in the square and the halbach testers. the results of this analysis was a design that mitigates the variation in b by a combination of sinusoidally distributed windings, and a deep yoke. the proposed magnetizer achieved very high flux densities over a relatively wide frequency range, which were 2.04 and 1.69 t at 60 hz and 1 khz, respectively.
polymerase_chain_reaction	phenytoin, a voltage-gated sodium channel (na-v channel) antagonist, reportedly inhibits arginine vasopressin (avp) release from an isolated rat neurohypophysis. so far, it is uncertain whether phenytoin has a direct action on ectopic avp-producing neuroendocrine tumors. we studied the effect of phenytoin on the release of copeptin, the c-terminal fragment of pro-avp, and expression of avp gene in the human small cell lung cancer cell line lu-165. cells were maintained in rpmi1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and were used within the fifth passage. copeptin was detected using a new sandwich immunoassay, and avp mrna levels were measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. treatment with phenytoin at a concentration of 25 mu g/ml, but not at 5 or 10 mu g/ml, had an inhibitory effect on copeptin levels in the medium at 48 h. at the same concentration, avp mrna levels in lu-165 cells also decreased. although a sodium challenge with added sodium at 20 meq/l increased copeptin levels in the medium, a sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 and 20 meq/l had no effect on avp mrna levels. phenytoin at a concentration of 25 mu g/ml suppressed copeptin levels in the medium under the sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 and 20 meq/l. phenytoin at a concentration of 25 mu g/ml also decreased avp mrna levels in lu-165 cells under the sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 meq/l, but not at 20 meq/l. among five tested nav channel subunits, na-v 1.3 was highly expressed in lu-165 cells. however, phenytoin significantly decreased na-v 1.3 mrna levels under the sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 and 20 meq/l. these results suggest that lu-165 cells are sensitive to phenytoin and sodium to control of avp release and its gene expression. phenytoin might have a direct action on ectopic avp-producing tumors, suggesting the importance of nav channels in avp-producing neuroendocrine tumors.
southern_blotting	the aim of this study was to characterize and determine the inter-serovar exchange of ampc beta-lactamase conferring plasmids isolated from humans, pigs and the swine environment. plasmids isolated from a total of 21 antimicrobial resistant (amr) salmonella isolates representing human clinical cases (n = 6), pigs (n = 6) and the swine farm environment (n = 9) were characterized by replicon typing and restriction digestion, inter-serovar transferability by conjugation, and presence of ampc beta-lactamase enzyme encoding gene bla(cmy-2) by southern hybridization. based on replicon typing, the majority (17/21, 81%) of the plasmids belonged to the i1-i gamma inc group and were between 70 and 103 kb. the potential for inter-serovar plasmid transfer was further confirmed by the pcr detection of amr genes on the plasmids isolated from trans-conjugants. plasmids from salmonella serovars anatum, ouakam, johannesburg and typhimurium isolated from the same cohort of pigs and their environment and s. heidelberg from a single human clinical isolate had identical plasmids based on digestion with multiple restriction enzymes (ecori, hindiii and psti) and southern blotting. we demonstrated likely horizontal inter-serovar exchange of plasmid-encoding ampc beta-lactamases resistance among mdr salmonella serotypes isolated from pigs, swine farm environment and clinical human cases. this study provides valuable information on the role of the swine farm environment and by extension other livestock farm environments, as a potential reservoir of resistant bacterial strains that potentially transmit resistance determinants to livestock, in this case, swine, humans and possibly other hosts by horizontal exchange of plasmids.

manufacturing_engineering	in our research, the simulation model driven engineering for manufacturing cell (smde-mc) is proposed. the purposes of smde-mc are to support the manufacturing engineering processes based on the simulation model and to extend the range of control applications and simulation applications using the pc based control. smde-mc provides the simulation model which controls and monitors the manufacturing cell directly using pc based control in the manufacturing system execution phase. then when the simulation model acts in response to its behaviors, the manufacturing system is controlled by synchronizing the simulation model behaviors. in the manufacturing system implementation phase, the simulation model is mixed and synchronized with real equipment, real controllers, and management applications under a condition where parts of equipment, control programs, and manufacturing management applications are not provided in a manufacturing system.
molecular_biology	glycated hemoglobin (hb a(1c)) determination by multicapillary zone electrophoresis (mze) can additionally be used to detect hb a(2), hb f and most common hemoglobin (hb) variants. we assessed the effectiveness of this method for detecting -thalassemia (-thal), -thalassemia (-thal) and most common hb variants. moreover, hb f/hb a(2) is evaluated as an index for discriminating between - and -thal traits. the theoretical -thalassemia major (-tm) birth rate in our healthcare area is calculated and contrasted with real data. a mze technique was used for hb a(1c) measurements in 27,724 patients. previous criteria for carrier detection were established and subsequently confirmed by molecular biology techniques. positive predictive value (ppv) was 100.0%. the prevalence of -thal trait (including -thal) was 0.34%. the most prevalent mutations (estimated per 100,000 population) were hbb: c.118c>t (57.7%), hbb: c.93-21g>a (50.5%), hbb: c.92+1g>a (43.3%), hbb: c.92+6t>c (32.5%) and hbb: c.20dela (18.0%) for -thalassemias, and hb s (hbb: c.20a>t) (32.5%) and hb j-baltimore (hbb:c.3880t>a) (28.9%) for hb variants. we found a paradoxical result between the theoretical -tm birth rate and real data. we calculated an optimal hb f/hb a(2) index cutoff of 0.71 for discriminating between - and -thal traits. this method is highly cost-effective for detecting -thalassemias and common hb variants. prevalence results match previous data for the spanish population. heterogeneity of mutations in spain has markedly increased as a consequence of migration. the hb f/hb a(2) index cutoff could be used to predict -thal trait.
polymerase_chain_reaction	effective disease management of crops is crucial to sustain food security and safeguard potential losses in crop production that worth billions of dollars. the key to success in plant disease management is having the ability to detect the causal pathogen(s) early and accurately. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been a gold standard in nucleic acid-based diagnostics. apart from pcr, within the last decade, the development of a technique called ""loop-mediated isothermal amplification"" or lamp has facilitated the development of hundreds of simple assays for plant disease diagnostics. there are now more than 200 lamp publications per year, of which 20% identify plant disease pathogens. among them, lamp assays are available for pathogen detection of 50 plant viruses, 20 bacterial plant diseases, 7 fungal plant diseases and several phytoplasmas. here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of all lamp assays available for detecting plant diseases, including various detection chemistries used. we also discuss how to avoid pitfalls when developing lamp assays. finally, we offer perspectives of the applications of lamp in plant disease management, addressing the questions as to which extent the assays are helpful and whether they should be used outside the laboratory. this review will be a ""handbook"" for researchers developing lamp assays for plant disease diagnostics.
fluid_mechanics	in this paper we show two applications for a generalization of the lambert w function. explicit calculations are given for the inverse langevin function that plays an important role in the study of paramagnetic materials, and for the dispersion equations for water waves. after these examples we provide some additional knowledge on the generalized lambert function as well as a review of former studies made towards this direction by other authors.
machine_design	the design of a flywheel system for energy storage is herein performed through the model based systems engineering (mbse) as an example of mechatronic product development and innovation. some relevant advantages of the mbse applied to a material mechatronic system, in some activities, as the requirement analysis, the identification of system capabilities, the definition of architecture and the system validation are identified. moreover, the paper is aimed at investigating some critical issues arising when the mbse tools are applied to machine design, being still a domain poorly inclined to exploit this holistic approach. that trend might be related to technical difficulties in assessing an interoperable framework of simulators aimed at dealing simultaneously with functional and physical models. in addition the technology scouting looks poorly connected within the standard sysml diagrams, without introducing some additional charts. a demonstration of the fruitful impact of the mbse on the machine design is herein proposed, to show some advantages provided as a mechatronic integrated system is conceived and how a complete trade-off analysis could be supported by the mbse modeling activity.
cell_biology	regenerative medicine strategies for the restoration of functional tissue have evolved from the concept of ex vivo creation of engineered tissue toward the broader concept of in vivo induction of functional tissue reconstruction. multidisciplinary approaches are being investigated to achieve this goal using evolutionarily conserved principles of stem cell biology, developmental biology and immunology, current methods of engineering and medicine. this evolution from ex vivo tissue engineering to the manipulation of fundamental in vivo tenets of development and regeneration has the potential to capitalize upon the incredibly complex and only partially understood ability of cells to adapt, proliferate, self-organize and differentiate into functional tissue.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective:although increasing evidence has shown that long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play an important regulatory role in pluripotency and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, little is known about the role of lncrna in maxillary sinus membrane stem cells (msmscs). the goal of this study was to investigate the expression profile and function of lncrnas on osteogenic differentiation of msmscs.materials and methods:by using lncrna microarray, we identify a novel osteogenesis differentiation-related lncrna of msmscs (lncrna-modr). the functional role of lncrna-modr in regulating osteogenesis was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and alizarin red staining. bioinformatic analyses of the predicted target genes (gene ontology, pathway, and network analysis) were applied for further study of lncrna-modr.results:we show that lncrna-modr is gradually upregulated during osteogenic differentiation. lncrna-modr overexpression upregulated, whereas lncrna-modr silencing decreased the expression of the osteogenic key marker, runt-related transcription factor 2 (runx2). in-depth analyses showed that lncrna-modr acts as a molecular sponge for microrna-454 (mir-454) and that prevents runx2 from mi-454-mediated suppression.conclusion:the lncrnas act as a competing endogenous rna to sequester microrna-454 (mir-454), leading to heightened runx2 expression and thus promotes osteogenesis of msmscs.
computer-aided_design	multi-scale computer aided design of manufacturing processes of a magnesium bracket for the automotive industry is the main goal of the present paper. tensile tests at various deformation conditions (temperatures, strain rates etc.) were performed to obtain flow stress data necessary for the macro-scale finite element analysis. the digital material representation concept was used to create a micro-scale model and to evaluate the influence of local microstructural features in the form of twins on material behaviour. an algorithm based on the cellular automata method capable of replicating microstructural morphology with twins was proposed to provide the digital material representation model. the bracket made of az31 magnesium alloy was formed at an elevated temperature of 200 degrees c. description of the study as well as results obtained at two length scales are presented in the paper.
materials_engineering	teeth are brittle and highly susceptible to cracking. we propose that observations of such cracking can be used as a diagnostic tool for predicting bite force and inferring tooth function in living and fossil mammals. laboratory tests on model tooth structures and extracted human teeth in simulated biting identify the principal fracture modes in enamel. examination of museum specimens reveals the presence of similar fractures in a wide range of vertebrates, suggesting that cracks extended during ingestion or mastication. the use of 'fracture mechanics' from materials engineering provides elegant relations for quantifying critical bite forces in terms of characteristic tooth size and enamel thickness. the role of enamel microstructure in determining how cracks initiate and propagate within the enamel ( and beyond) is discussed. the picture emerges of teeth as damage-tolerant structures, full of internal weaknesses and defects and yet able to contain the expansion of seemingly precarious cracks and fissures within the enamel shell. how the findings impact on dietary pressures forms an undercurrent of the study.
fluid_mechanics	we present a frame-invariant method for detecting coherent structures from lagrangian flow trajectories that can he sparse in number, as is the case in many fluid mechanics applications of practical interest. 'the method, based on principles used in graph colouring and spectral graph drawing algorithms, examines a measure of the kinematic dissimilarity of all pairs of fluid trajectories, measured either experimentally, e.g. using particle tracking velocimetry, or numerically, by advecting fluid particles in the eulerian velocity field. coherence is assigned to groups of particles whose kinematics remain similar throughout the time interval for which trajectory data are available, regardless of their physical proximity to one another. through the use of several analytical and experimental validation cases, this algorithm is shown to robustly detect coherent structures using significantly less flow data than are required by existing spectral graph theory methods.
molecular_biology	objective: the objective of this study was to construct a recombinant vector expressing sirna targetedly inhibiting aquaporin 3 (aqp3), and to evaluate the effects of aqp3 inhibition on the proliferation and invasion of xwlc-05 human lung cancer cells. methods: we obtained human aqp3 sequence from the genbank and established the recombinant vector expressing sirna targeting aqp3. after the transfection of the recombinant vectors, the expression of aqp3 was determined by rt-pcr and western blot. the mts assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay were conducted to detect the proliferation, cell cycle process, apoptosis and invasion of xvvlc-05 cells. then the activity of metal matrix proteinase (mmp) 2 was determined by gelatin zymography. tumor formation in vivo experiments were also conducted in nude mice. results: rna interference (rnai) of aqp3 substantially suppressed the xwlc-05 cell proliferation and invasion, blocked the cell cycle progressing and promoted cell apoptosis. in addition, the activity of mmp2 was remarkably attenuated in rnai group. aqp3 rnai did not affect the tumor formation rate in nude mice but reduced the tumor growth. conclusion: the inhibition of aqp3 retarded the growth and invasiveness of xwlc-05 lung cancer cells and decreased the activity of mmp2.

immunology	background adenoid hypertrophy is one of the main causes of upper airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnoea (osa) in children. studies have shown that administration of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray significantly improved oxygen saturation in children with sleep-disordered breathing. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray on oxygen saturation measured through nocturnal pulse oximetry and quality of life in children with sleep-disordered breathing due to adenoid hypertrophy. materials and methods eighty children suspected of having sleep-disordered breathing due to adenoid hypertrophy, whose parents were not willing for surgery (adenoidectomy) were enrolled in a non-controlled clinical trial. quality of life questionnaire was distributed pre-and post-interventional and the symptoms were scored depending on its frequency of occurrence. pre-and post-intervention x-ray nasopharynx taken. pre-and post-intervention nocturnal oxygen saturation monitoring was done and oxygen desaturation index (odi) as well as desaturation events were recorded. data was analysed using paired student t-test and wilcoxon 's signed rank tests. results out of the 80 study population, 43 were males (53.8 %) and 37 were females (46.2%). age distribution of the population ranged from 3 to 10 years with a mean age of 6.2 years. the study showed a strong positive correlation between grade of adenoid size and odi (r -0.790; p < 0.001). all the pulse oximetric parameters improved significantly after drug administration (p < 0.001). there was a significant improvement in the quality of life of these children after the treatment. conclusion the study revealed mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray therapy leads to significant reduction in adenoid size and gives symptomatic relief for children with sleep disordered breathing. it can be recommended as the prime medical treatment modality for children with sleep disordered breathing, as it substantially reduced the morbidity and health care utilisation by these children.
thermodynamics	the present paper provides a dynamic, non-linear and fully coupled finite element (fe) formulation based on the timoshenko beam theory to study elasto-thermoelectric responses in thermoelectric devices. the two main motivations of this work are: i) to study mechanical responses in thermoelectric devices, which must be taken into account in the design of peltier cells due to the fragility and relative low strength of the semiconductors, and ii) to provide a numerical tool that decreases the cpu time to allow the introduction of designs based on optimization processes and on sensitivity analyses that could require many evaluations. in order to undertake the objectives of this work, the general three-dimensional governing equations are reduced to one-dimensional ones by means of several assumptions. then, a set of five multi-coupled partial differential equations is obtained. the resultant expressions are thermodynamically consistent and form a multi-coupled monolithic fe formulation, differently to stagger formulations that require two separated steps to reach the final result. numerically, this set of multi-coupled equations is discretized using the fe method and implemented into feap taylor, 2010 [1]. for a proper validation of the code, four benchmarks are performed using one-dimensional dynamic analytical solutions developed by the authors. finally, this formulation is compared with a three-dimensional fe formulation also developed by the authors in pe' rez-aparicio et al., 2015 [2] to model a commercial peltier cell. this comparison reveals that: i) relative errors are lower than 13% and ii) cpu times decrease significantly, more than one order of magnitude. in conclusion, the beam thermoelectric formulation is an accurate model that reduces cpu time and could be used in future design of thermoelectric devices.
enzymology	the composting of organic material is dependent on microbial activity. however, the dynamics of the microbial community during the composting process remain obscure. here, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rdna amplicons in a chicken manure-based compost was applied to characterize the components of the microbial community during the composting process. in addition, the activity of key microbial enzymes was monitored. arcobacter spp. and marinospirillum spp. were the dominant species prior to composting, whereas thermotogae spp. became more strongly represented as the composting process proceeded. bacillus and cohnella spp. were featured at various phases. correlation analysis showed that the diversity of the microbial community was positively correlated with the compost ph, its total nitrogen level, its carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and the activity of protease, and negatively correlated with its organic carbon content and seed germination indices.

enzymology	a short, robust, and expedient synthesis of various aryl alpha-l-arabinofuranosides using a trichloroacetimidate precursor is described. the procedure is compatible with a range of phenols with varying pka values and may be amenable for preparing a wide range of other glycosides.
human_metabolism	we discuss a human metabolism system using the theory of stochastic differential equations (sdes) with reflecting boundary conditions. we investigate the distribution of the process determined by the sdes. the relation between the deterministic model introduced by nordberg and kjellstrom and our stochastic model is considered. numerical computations are also given.
southern_blotting	glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and glutathione reductase (gr) are key enzymes in the antioxidant defense systems of living organisms and protect organisms from environmental stresses. to investigate the mechanism of resistance to heat stress in the red alga gracilaria lemaneiformis, the cdna sequences encoding glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase of two strains (wild type and heat-tolerant cultivar 981) of g. lemaneiformis were successfully cloned using reverse transcription pcr and rapid amplification cdna ends techniques. cdna encoding gpx has 930 nucleotides with an open reading frame (orf) of 750 nucleotides, encoding 249 amino acid residues. cdna encoding gr was 1,572 nucleotides with a 1,416-nucleotide orf encoding 471 amino acids. no introns existed in genomic dna of gpx and gr of g. lemaneiformis. southern blotting indicated that there was only one copy of gpx and gr in both strains. under heat stress, bioactivity and mrna transcription levels of both gpx and gr were upregulated in cultivar 981 compared to those in the wild type. these results indicate that both gpx and gr may play important roles in the ability of g. lemaneiformis to resist high temperatures.
cell_biology	polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) are vital for normal growth and development and physiological function of various tissues in humans. pufas have immunomodulatory actions in addition to their ability to modulate inflammation, vascular reactivity, neurotransmission and stem cell biology. pufas and their metabolites possess both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that underlie their actions and involvement in several diseases. aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), possesses both cyclo-oxygenase (cox) and lipoxygenase (lox) inhibitory action and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory lipoxin a4 {(called as epi-lipoxin a4, aspirin-triggered lipoxins (atls))}. in addition, at low doses aspirin may not interfere with the production of prostacyclin (pgi2). both lipoxin a4 and pgi2 have vasodilator, platelet anti-aggregator and anti-inflammatory actions that may underlie the beneficial actions of aspirin. paradoxically, other nsaids may not have the same actions as that of aspirin on pufa metabolism. similar anti-inflammatory compounds are formed from eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) by the action of aspirin termed as resolvins (from epa and dha) and protectins and maresins from dha. pufas: arachidonic acid (aa), epa and dha and their various products modulate not only inflammation and immune response but also possess actions on various genes, nuclear factors, cyclic amp and gmp, g-protein coupled receptors (gprs), hypothalamic neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines and enzymes, and interact with nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide to regulate their formation and action and to form new compounds that have several biological actions. these pleiotropic actions of pufas and their metabolites may explain their ability to play a role in several physiological actions and diseases. the big challenge is to harness these actions to prevent and manage clinical conditions.

cell_biology	lysosomal storage disorders (lsds) are inherited diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and often showing a neurodegenerative course. there is no cure to treat the central nervous system in lsds. moreover, the mechanisms driving neuronal degeneration in these pathological conditions remain largely unknown. by studying mouse models of lsds, we found that neurodegeneration develops progressively with profound alterations in presynaptic structure and function. in these models, impaired lysosomal activity causes massive perikaryal accumulation of insoluble -synuclein and increased proteasomal degradation of cysteine string protein (csp). as a result, the availability of both -synuclein and csp at nerve terminals strongly decreases, thus inhibiting soluble nsf attachment receptor (snare) complex assembly and synaptic vesicle recycling. aberrant presynaptic snare phenotype is recapitulated in mice with genetic ablation of one allele of both csp and -synuclein. the overexpression of csp in the brain of a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type iiia, a severe form of lsd, efficiently re-established snare complex assembly, thereby ameliorating presynaptic function, attenuating neurodegenerative signs, and prolonging survival. our data show that neurodegenerative processes associated with lysosomal dysfunction may be presynaptically initiated by a concomitant reduction in -synuclein and csp levels at nerve terminals. they also demonstrate that neurodegeneration in lsds can be slowed down by re-establishing presynaptic functions, thus identifying synapse maintenance as a novel potentially druggable target for brain treatment in lsds.
computer-aided_design	this paper presents the design and development of a 190 ghz schottky-diode frequency doubler (x2 multiplier) which can handle up to 260 mw input power. in order to increase the power handling capability, a modeling approach incorporating computer-aided design (cad) load-pull techniques to characterize the diode performance is proposed. by the use of this approach, effects of several critical diode parameters on the power handling issue are quantitatively investigated and based on the analysis, a discrete diode chip is designed for the doubler. to ensure rapid heat sink in the doubler circuitry, low cost aluminum nitride ceramic (aln) is selected as the dielectric material of the circuit substrate, which has significantly better thermal conductivity compared with currently widely-used fused quartz. the doubler circuitry is based on a balanced configuration, which brings a merit of avoiding the use of a filter for the input and output signal isolation. the doubler circuit is optimized by co-simulation using ansys 's hfss and keysight 's ads. the measurements show that the doubler can handle up to 260 mw input power with a power conversion efficiency of nearly 8%, resulting in 20 mw output power at 193 ghz.
molecular_biology	avian paramyxoviruses (apmvs) have been reported from a wide variety of avian species around the world. avian paramyxoviruses are economically significant because of the huge mortality and morbidity associated with it. twelve different serotypes of apmv have been reported till date. avian paramyxoviruses belong to the family paramyxoviridae under genus avulavirus. newcastle disease virus (apmv-1) is the most characterized members among the apmv serotypes. complete genome sequence of all twelve apmv serotypes has been published recently. in recent years, apmv-1 has attracted the virologists for its oncolytic activity and its use as a vaccine vector for both animals and humans. the recombinant apmv-based vaccine offers a pertinent choice for the construction of live attenuated vaccine due to its minimum recombination frequency, modular nature of transcription and lack of dna phase during its replication. although insufficient data are available regarding other apmv serotypes, our understanding about the apmv biology is expanding rapidly because of the availability of modern molecular biology tools and high-throughput complete genome sequencing.
machine_design	the roller is one of the main parts of a high-pressure grinding roller, which is a type of highly efficient ore crushing equipment. its working life is strongly affected by the materials used. in this paper, a new kind of roller material, the high-vanadium alloy steel (hvas), was investigated. the results showed that the as-cast microstructures of the hvas roller contained martensite, residual austenite, and alloy carbides. the hvas sample quenched at 1,080 degrees c had a high hardness, and it had much higher compressive strength and abrasive wear resistance after tempering at 560 degrees c for 30 min. the mechanical properties of the hvas are more sufficient than the existing roller materials, which are feasible for larger machine design.
hydraulics	hydromechanical systems are prone to significant oscillations, due to the ability of hydraulic oil to store potential energy. this is extremely important when considering mobile hydraulic machinery, especially those machines which handle large loads. oscillations can negatively affect the stability of the payload, the comfort of the operator, and the overall safety of the system. for the particular case of earthmoving machines, several systems have been designed in order to alleviate these oscillations and increase machine operability. these systems include both passive and active designs which attempt to utilize the motion of the payload in such a way as to cancel out the effect of machine vibrations. this paper seeks to assess the potential advantages of active oscillation control strategies with respect to current state of art passive strategies. a reference case vehicle (wheel loader) is presented and analyzed in order to determine its typical vibrational behavior. a simulation model for the reference machine is developed and used in assessing machine performance. the effectiveness of the current passive vibration damping approach with respect to reducing the vibrations perceived by the operator in the cabin, as well as those affecting the payload, is presented. then, an active (electrohydraulic) control structure is presented using both acceleration and pressure feedback, including an adaptive controller constructed using an extremum-seeking algorithm. to quantitatively compare the relative performances of these various systems, an appropriate objective function is defined. simulation results are presented for each of the considered control strategies, and their performances are compared. the simulation indicates a performance of active vibration control systems roughly equivalent to that of currently implemented passive control strategies. in some cases, the active control performance is actually two to three times as effective as the passive control.

molecular_biology	electrochemical monitoring-on-chip (e-moc)-based approach for rapid assessment of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infection in the presence of cocaine (coc) and specific drugs namely i.e., tenofovir (tef), rimcazole (ra) is demonstrated here, for the first time, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis). an in-vitro primary human astrocytes (ha) model was developed using a cultureware chip (cc, used for e-moc) for hiv-infection, coc exposure and treatment with anti-hiv drug i.e., tef, and coc antagonist i.e., ra. the charge transfer resistance (r-ct) value of each cc well varies with respect to infection and treatment demonstrated highly responsive sensitivity of developed chip. the results of e-moc, a proof-of-the concept, suggested that hiv-infection progression due to coc ingestion and therapeutic effects of highly specific drugs are measurable on the basis of cell electrophysiology. though, this work needs various molecular biology-based optimizations to promote this technology as an analytical tool for the rapid assessment of hiv-infection in a patient to manage hiv diseases for timely diagnosis. the presented study is based on using cns cells and efforts are being made to perform this method using peripheral cells such as monocytes derived dendritic cells.

human_metabolism	the high resolution, accurate mass, and fast scanning features of the orbitrap(tm) mass spectrometer, combined with the separation power of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography were applied for the first time to study the metabolic profiles of several organic flame retardants (frs) present in indoor dust. to mimic real-life exposure, in vitro cultured hepg2 human hepatocyte cell lines were exposed simultaneously to various frs in an indoor dust extract for 24 h. target parent frs, hexabromocyclododecanes (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hbcds), tris-2-chloroethyl phosphate (tcep), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (tcipp), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (tdcipp), were separated in a single run for the first time using alternating positive and negative heated esi source. further metabolite separation and identification was achieved using full scan (70,000 full width at half maximum (fwhm)), accurate mass (up to 1 ppm) spectrometry. structural confirmation was performed via all ion fragmentation (aif) spectra using the optional higher collisional dissociation (hcd) cell and ms/ms analysis. first insights into human metabolism of hbcds revealed several hydroxylated and debrominated phase i metabolites, in addition to conjugated phase ii glucuronides. furthermore, various hydroxylated, oxidized, and conjugated metabolites of chlorinated phosphorous frs were identified, leading to the suggestion of alpha-oxidation as a significant metabolic pathway for these compounds.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the present study was designed to investigate the relationship among epigenetic changes in wnt antagonists, histone h4k20mel and the expression of tumor-suppressor genes in acute leukemia (al) to better understand the pathogenesis of leukemia. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) was performed to detect messenger rna (mrna) expression levels of wnt antagonists (wnt5a, hdpr1, dkk1 and dkk3) in patients with al and in normal controls; pyrophosphate sequencing was performed to detect the methylation status of the wnt5a promoter; and western blotting was performed to detect the overall expression levels of wnt5a protein and histone h4k20mel in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and in normal controls. the relationship between wnt5a protein expression and histone h4k20mel was analyzed. chromatin immunoprecipitation-qpcr (chip-qpcr) was performed to investigate the recruitment of h4k20mel and set8 to the wnt5a promoter and coding regions. our results demonstrated that the expression levels of wnt antagonists were generally low in aml, but showed differential expression in acute lymphocytic leukemia (all). in most cases of aml, methylation of the wnt5a promoter was observed and wnt5a protein expression was low. in some cases of aml, the overall level of h4k20mel protein was higher than that in normal controls. in addition, wnt5a expression was positively correlated with h4k20mel expression and was unrelated to the methylation status of its promoter. moreover, h4k20mel and set8 were enriched in the wnt5a promoter region and coding region. by contrast, wnt5a expression was unrelated to h4k20mel expression in normal controls. moreover, we observed that the methylation of wnt antagonists was often found in patients with al, particularly those with aml, whereas the extent of methylation was variable in all patients. wnt5a expression was positively correlated with the enrichment of h4k20mel and set8 at the wnt5a promoter and coding regions. h4k20mel increased wnt5a expression by promoting transcription initiation and elongation.
hydraulics	in this study, the corrosion behaviors of carbon steel and stainless steel are investigated for water-saturated co2 system to examine the condition of co2 injection wells in co2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery (eor) operations. in our model, potential nonisothermal effects resulting from co2 injection activities, including joule-thomson effect, heat transfer between co2 stream and surrounding well/rock formation, the adiabatic (de-) compression of co2, and the frictional losses, are accounted. the model is applied to onshore and offshore wells using realistic data. in the offshore well, the depth is considered to vary as a power function of lateral distance from the sea floor to the perforation. depending on scales of injection, our calculations show that the corrosion rates in the tubing wall from the wellhead to bottomhole is on the order of 1 mm/y for carbon steel. for stainless steel, the rate obtained is 0.0057 mm/y. results of this study provide insights on the material selection of co2 injection wells, design of injection operations, as well as leakage monitoring and risk assessment in wellbores.

machine_design	the paper presents the optimum design of a permanent magnet synchronous generator for wind power applications. the proposed optimization strategy deals with two contradictory objectives: to reduce generator costs and to raise the energy yield. this task is accomplished by maximizing the difference between the energy proceeds and the generator costs. the generator operating cycle is taken into account by a weibull function that represents the wind profile for a fictitious site. a thermal model is adopted to evaluate the winding temperature and prevent overheating. the optimally designed machine is a 3phase generator for 40 kw direct drive wind turbines. the results show that this strategy would produce a cost-effective machine.
human_metabolism	this article we discuss the categories work, politics, education and human emancipation in marx and lukacs. as from the work category, we will seek to understand the policy, training and human emancipation as foundations necessary to the formation of social being. starting from the ontological leap produced by work category, historically-checks the implementation of the conditions and possibilities for the development of other fundamental complex to the formation of social being. through the removal of natural barriers, lukacs, in the wake of marx, demonstrates how the double transformation mediated by work in the human metabolism with nature, occurs in the training materials / social / historical human, becoming the basis of all its social praxis therefore their emancipation. we will also discuss about ""antisocial character"" private property and the state, therefore the policy to uncover the origin of social problems and its essence. politics is, according to marx, one half activity, historically dated and instrumental. it 's something that has to be overcome. this conception of politics, and the state, rejects the understanding that it is a dimension of human and social permanently and structurally.
manufacturing_engineering	material flow analysis is an essential engineering task for effective production and requires a large amount of information that is related to products, processes, resources, and plants. due to the lack of a systematic framework and supporting system between engineers and related manufacturing information resources, many simulation engineers have actually wasted time and cost with redundant tasks for simulation. a p3r-driven modeling and simulation system in plm is suggested and implemented in this paper. for this purpose, a p3r data structure is defined for simulation-model generation, and a middleware application is developed based on the p3r object-oriented model. finally, a concurrent material flow analysis system is developed and applied for area and flow analysis. as a case study, the developed methodology and systems of p3r-driven modeling and simulation are practically applied to automotive press shops. based on the results, the proposed methodology and systems in this paper are very useful in terms of reducing time and cost in material flow analysis via simulations. also, it is possible to perform more effective engineering tasks such as simulation for material flow analysis via integrated environment, because relevant data for simulation can be extracted from plm system automatically and that data is compatible with actual or planned shop floor. this will lead to seamless implementation of manufacturing engineering processes with more effective decision making processes. furthermore, concurrent material flow analysis is possible from the early stages of product development and production.

machine_design	the work of product designers has to evolve in phase with the improvements made to technology and changes in regulations. they have to work on different aspects of a product such as its technological, legal, environmental and occupational safety implications. european directive 2006/42/ce promulgates safe machine design principles to prevent professional risks. these principles guide machine designers to reduce residual risks as much as the technological state of the art permits. special machine designers are by definition confronted by a lack of specific standards relating to a priori risk analysis. the aim of this paper is to present an original approach to help them to identify hazards upstream and also throughout the design process. this approach is based on the fact that hazards are linked to the presence of energies. hazard identification can be done through the detection of parameters linked to energy sources and flows. the approach then feeds back information to designers about potential contacts between energies and workers, to highlight the need to add preventive measures. we use the functional-structural model is used to represent the machine energy architecture through the different steps of its lifecycle. thus it is possible to identify every interface through which energies circulate. these interfaces are defined by two kinds of parameter: energetic parameters (linked to energy properties), and other design parameters. this paper first presents a detailed classification of energetic parameters that are also indicators of the hazards present in the machine. we then present logical rules for processing these energetic parameters and others, in order to increase the accuracy of the hazard identification performed. to conclude, the results obtained from using this approach during the industrial design of a supply line is detailed to validate the pertinence of its application from the earliest design stages, with improved accuracy during the subsequent design stages.

molecular_biology	porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) causes acute enteric disease and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. previously we have demonstrated that pdcov infection suppresses the production of interferon-beta (ifn-beta), while the detailed mechanisms are poorly understood. here, we demonstrate that nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) of pdcov, the 3c-like protease, significantly inhibits sendai virus (sev)-induced ifn-beta production by targeting the nf-kappa b essential modulator (nemo), confirmed by the diminished function of nemo cleaved by pdcov. the pdcov nsp5 cleavage site in the nemo protein was identified as glutamine 231, and was identical to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nsp5 cleavage site, revealing the likelihood of a common target in nemo for coronaviruses. furthermore, this cleavage impaired the ability of nemo to activate the ifn response and downstream signaling. taken together, our findings reveal pdcov nsp5 to be a newly identified ifn antagonist and enhance the understanding of immune evasion by deltacoronaviruses.
molecular_biology	prostate cancer is the most common cancer of men in the uk and accounts for a quarter of all new cases. although treatment of localised cancer can be successful, there is no cure for patients presenting with invasive prostate cancer and there are less treatment options. they are generally treated with androgen ablation therapies but eventually the tumours become hormone resistant and patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) for which there are no further successful or curative treatments. this highlights the need for new treatment strategies. in order to prevent prostate cancer recurrence and treatment resistance, all the cell populations in a heterogeneous prostate tumour must be targeted, including the rare cancer stem cell (csc) population. the ets transcription factor family members are now recognised as a common feature in multiple cancers including prostate cancer; with aberrant expression, loss of tumour suppressor function, inactivating mutations and the formation of fusion genes observed. most notably, the tmprss2-erg gene fusion is present in approximately 50% of prostate cancers and in prostate cscs. however, the role of other ets transcription factors in prostate cancer is less well understood. this review will describe the prostate epithelial cell hierarchy and discuss the evidence behind prostate cscs and their inherent resistance to conventional cancer therapies. the known and proposed roles of the ets family of transcription factors in prostate epithelial cell differentiation and regulation of the csc phenotype will be discussed, as well as how they might be targeted for therapy.

strength_of_materials	a concept map heuristic is offered as a tool for teaching and learning in mechanics of materials courses. in this paper, we present a literature review wherein we list previous efforts to improve mechanics of materials learning and the use of concept maps for teaching. we provide our ""common concept map,"" we detail several ways in which we 've used the heuristic, and finally describe preliminary results assessing its efficacy.
enzymology	cofactor-free oxidases and oxygenases promote and control the reactivity of o-2 with limited chemical tools at their disposal. their mechanism of action is not completely understood and structural information is not available for any of the reaction intermediates. near-atomic resolution crystallography supported by incrystallo raman spectroscopy and qm/mm calculations showed unambiguously that the archetypical cofactor-free uricase catalyzes uric acid degradation via a c5(s)-(hydro)peroxide intermediate. low x-ray doses break specifically the intermediate c5oo(h) bond at 100k, thus releasing o-2 insitu, which is trapped above the substrate radical. the dose-dependent rate of bond rupture followed by combined crystallographic and raman analysis indicates that ionizing radiation kick-starts both peroxide decomposition and its regeneration. peroxidation can be explained by a mechanism in which the substrate radical recombines with superoxide transiently produced in the active site.
human_metabolism	tilapia are generally known to be warm water fish widely distributed across the tropics. in particular, the maternal mouth brooding tilapia of the genera saroterodon and oreochromis have successfully adapted to a wide range of water bodies because of their plastic feeding habits and wide tolerance to varying environmental conditions (trewavas 1982). the nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus occurs in almost all rivers and lakes of ethiopia. it is the most important commercial fish, constituting over 60% of the commercial catch of the capture fishery in the country (reyntjens & wudineh 1998). investigations on the fatty acid composition and lipid quality of fishes have been well documented mainly from marine and freshwater systems of the temperate regions (puustinen et al. 1985, ahlgren et al. 1994, 1996). most studies can be broadly examined either from an ecological point of view or in relation to human health. from the medical point of view, two of the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa), eicosapentaenoic acid (epa, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha, 22:6 omega 3) common in fish and fish oil have several biochemical effects on human metabolism. fish oil rich in epa and dha can lower blood lipid and reduce the risk of getting coronary heart disease (mediorus et al. 2007). from an ecological view point, it is important to know the origin of these important pufa in fish and other animals at higher trophic levels. information on the transfer of fatty acids from the lower trophic levels beginning from the phyto-plankton can be obtained by quantifying the levels of important fatty acids across the food chain. these fatty acids can serve as biomarkers to elucidate the transfer and conversion of individual fatty acids (napolitano 1999). marine fish have been reported to have higher pufa content than their freshwater counterparts (napolitano 1999); however, ahlgren et al. (1994) and references therein think that the difference between marine and freshwater fish is related to other factors, such as feeding and type of fish, rather than the difference in salinity. in our earlier work we also found that tropical fish can be equally important to temperate fish in terms of pufa content (zenebe et al. 1998a). data on the fatty acid content of tropical fish are scarce and are mostly limited to fish from south america (clement & lovell 1994, andrade et al. 1995). in our earlier study we reported the fatty acid composition of o. niloticus collected from the rift valley lakes located at lower altitudes (zenebe et al. 1998a, 1998b). in this study i report the fatty acid composition of the same fish taken mainly from the highland lakes located outside the rift system of ethiopia. this information will provide broad comparisons and more comprehensive data on the fatty acid contents of o. niloticus collected from the wild in ethiopian lakes
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood. this study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting. results: pedv rna was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (inf) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr). virus shedding in inf pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral rna levels remained elevated through 19 dpi. sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (lb) became pedv positive after the first movement of study personnel from the inf group. however, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (mb) and high biosecurity (hb) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. viral rna was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (ppe) of lb personnel. in addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from mb personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. all swabs of fomite from the hb study personnel were negative. conclusions: these results indicate that indirect pedv transmission through contaminated ppe occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. biosecurity procedures such as changing ppe, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of pedv transmission between groups of pigs.
genetics	intimate partner violence (ipv) is a major health concern in the united states (acog 2013). the world health organization (who) describes ipv as any physical, sexual, psychological harm by a current or former intimate partner (who 2016). due to the psychosocial depth and nature of discussions within genetic counseling sessions, patients may disclose and/or discuss ipv as it relates to sexual well-being, reproductive and overall health. this study aims to assess the role for ipv screening, counseling and intervention in genetic counseling practice by investigating the incidence, experiences and attitudes about ipv among genetic counseling patients. patients receiving genetic counseling at an urban metropolitan hospital were anonymously surveyed about experiences and perspectives on ipv as a topic of discussion during genetic counseling sessions. among 60 eligible patients, 50 completed the survey (49 females, 1 male, of which, 5 identified as lgbt) ages 20 to 66. the incidence of ipv in this group was 16.0 % (n = 8). majority of participants had never been asked about ipv by a healthcare provider (n = 32; 64.0%), would have felt comfortable answering questions about ipv by their healthcare provider (n = 34; 68.0%), and would have felt comfortable answering questions about ipv by their genetic counselor (n = 39; 78.0%). perspectives from all participants, notably those with ipv history, provided insights to the role of genetic counselors in areas for ipv screening and counseling training.
machine_design	slotted axial-flux machines have excellent power and torque densities. however, it is difficult to reduce their cogging torque due to the complexity associated with implementing classical techniques. in this paper, slot-opening widths and tooth profiles will be shown to be significant in mitigating cogging torque in these machines. in particular, varying the slot opening reduced it by 52%, whereas a parallel-tooth (rectangular) profile lowered it by 24%, when compared with a conventional trapezoidal-tooth profile. an analytical quasi-3-d analysis was formulated and used to analyze and determine cogging torque. it was validated numerically and experimentally. its versatility is in its ability to analyze different shapes of poles and slot openings, which can be extended to model air-gap nonuniformity. this paper also presents cogging torque minimization techniques that maintain the ease of manufacture of the parallel-tooth stator. experimental results showed 73% and 48% reduction in cogging torque, which are achieved by the use of alternating pole arcs and skewed poles.
polymerase_chain_reaction	numerous patients with anorectal malformations (arms) continue to experience fecal incontinence and constipation following surgical procedures. one of the most important factors that influences defecation is the striated muscle complex (smc). wnt signaling regulates the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, which serve an important role in muscle development. therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of wnt3a protein (by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis) and mrna [by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr)] in the smc of arm model rats that were exposed to ethylenethiourea. immunostaining revealed that the expression of wnt3a exhibits space-and time-dependent changes in the developing smc of arm model rat embryos. immunohistochemistry demonstrated that on embryonic day 17 (e17), wnt3a-positive cells were observed in the smc in normal embryos, and expression levels gradually increased as the rat embryos developed. similar changes in wnt3a protein expression were detected in arm model rat embryos; however, the expression of wnt3a was significantly reduced compared with the normal rat embryos. western blotting and rt-qpcr also revealed lower expression levels of wnt3a protein and mrna, respectively, in the smc of arms model rat embryos compared with normal rat embryos. these data revealed that the expression of wnt3a in arm embryos was notably reduced, indicating a potential role for wnt3a in the maldevelopment of the smc in patients with arms.
human_metabolism	purpose of review galactose - a key source of energy and a crucial structural element in complex molecules - is particularly important for early human development. however, galactose metabolism might be important not only for fetal and neonatal development but also for adulthood, as evidenced by the inherited disorders of galactose metabolism. the purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence of galactose metabolism in health and disease. recent findings the biological importance of galactose goes beyond its importance as a nutrient and a metabolite. galactose has been selected by evolutionary pressure to exert also a crucial structural role in macromolecules. additionally, galactose has recently been reported as beneficial in a number of diseases, particularly in those affecting the brain. summary galactose is crucial for human metabolism, with an established role in energy delivery and galactosylation of complex molecules, and evidence for other roles is emerging.
materials_engineering	because of the important applications of platinum alloys and related platinum-group-metals phases, complete phase diagrams for these systems are important for materials engineering. the currently accepted phase diagram for the ag-pt system is questionable because of its disagreement with earlier experiments and because of its claim for a lone ordered structure at 53%-pt which was not characterized and which contradicts both computational predictions and analogy to the isoelectronic system cu-pt. a complete re-examination of the ag-pt system by computational and experimental means suggests a phase diagram similar to the isoelectronic system cu-pt. the unknown compound, claimed to be 53%-pt, is found to be the l1(1) structure at 50%-pt.

southern_blotting	background: expansion of gaa trinucleotide repeats is the molecular basis of friedreich 's ataxia (frda). precise detection of the gaa expansion repeat in frataxin gene has always been a challenge. different molecular methods have been suggested for detection of gaa expansion, including; short-pcr, long-pcr, triplet repeat primed-pcr (tp-pcr) and southern blotting. the aim of study was to evaluate two pcr-based methods, tp-pcr and long-pcr, and to explore the use of tp-pcr accompanying with long-pcr for accurate genotyping of frda patients. methods: blood samples were collected from six iranian patients suspected to frda, who referred to the department of medical genetics at tehran university of medical sciences during the year 2014. for one of these patients' four asymptomatic members of the family were also recruited for the analysis. dna extraction was performed by two different methods. tp-pcr and long-pcr were carried out in all samples. the type of this study is assessment / investigation of methods. results: using a combination of the above methods, the genotypes of all samples were confirmed as five homozygous mutants (expanded gaa repeats), two heterozygous and three homozygous normal (normal repeat size). the results obtained by tp-pcr are consistent with long-pcr results. conclusion: the presence or absence of expanded alleles can be identified correctly by tp-pcr. performing long-pcr and fluorescent-long-pcr enables accurate genotyping in all samples. this approach is highly reliable. it could be successfully used for detection of gaa expansion repeats.
machine_design	this paper proposes a new type of curve, an elliptical roulette, which it initially applies to rotary lobe pumps. once the new rotor profile has been mathematically modeled using the principle of gearing, equations can be derived to assess the presence or absence of undercutting in the tooth profile. the effect of the new profile properties on pumping performance is evaluated using a specially developed three-dimensional fluid analysis model. the proposed curve is tested using six novel rotor profiles based on the elliptical axial ratio parameter lambda (a shorter axis divided by a larger axis). these six new cases and a traditional case are analyzed under the same volume and clearance conditions and their differences compared. the results show that a smaller elliptical axial ratio design produces better flow characteristics. in particular, an elliptical axial ratio smaller than 0.6 not only achieves high discharge efficiency but allows vibration and noise to be controlled by the flow rate fluctuation coefficient, which approximates the traditional indicator. the proposed curve can thus serve as a useful reference for pump or rotary fluid machine design.

human_metabolism	there are several ways to detect proteins on cells. one quite frequently used method is flow cytometry. this method needs fluorescently labeled antibodies that can attach selectively to the protein to be investigated for flow cytometric detection. flow cytometry scans individual cells, virtually without their surrounding liquid, and can scan many cells in a very short time. because of this advantage of flow cytometry, it was adapted to investigate transport proteins on normal and cancerous human cells and cell lines. these transport proteins play important roles in human metabolism. absorption in the intestine, excretion at the kidney, protection of the cns compartment and the fetus from xenobiotics, and other vital functions depend on these transporters. however, several transporters are overexpressed in cancer cells. these overexpressed transporters pump out anticancer drugs from the cells and prevent their curative effects. the detection and quantitation of these types of transporters in cancer cells is important for this reason. here, we review literature on flow cytometric detection of the three most studied transporters: p-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein.
materials_engineering	this paper presents an overview and examples of material design and development using (1) classical thermodynamics; (2) calphad (calculation of phase diagrams) modeling; and (3) integrated computational materials engineering (icme) approaches. although the examples are given in lightweight aluminum and magnesium alloys for structural applications, the fundamental methodology and modeling principles are applicable to all materials and engineering applications. the examples in this paper have demonstrated the effectiveness and limitations of classical thermodynamics in solving specific problems (such as nucleation during solidification and solid-state precipitation in aluminum alloys). computational thermodynamics and calphad modeling, when combined with critical experimental validation, have been used to guide the selection and design of new magnesium alloys for elevated-temperature applications. the future of material design and development will be based on a holistic icme approach. however, key challenges exist in many aspects of icme framework, such as the lack of diffusion/mobility databases for many materials systems, limitation of current microstructural modeling capability and integration tools for simulation codes of different length scales.

hydraulics	an understanding of thermal hydraulics, its basic phenomena, and its application to nuclear power plants is vital to safe as well as efficient design and operation. thermal hydraulics for two-phase flow and heat transfer with nuclear applications has been studied for roughly 50 years, and the current body of knowledge is extensive. yet, there remain safety issues, and the licensing of new light water reactor designs or new analysis methodologies is rarely simple. this is due to the state of the art in reactor thermal hydraulics as well as the perspective that the regulator, in this case the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission (nrc), has toward that field of study. this paper discusses the state of the art in nuclear thermal hydraulics, the regulator 's unique role and perspective, and a view of current challenges. the discussion is meant to point out how the regulator 's perspective has been shaped and hopefully provide some guidance on fulfilling research needs for future applications that may need nrc review.
enzymology	the membrane-anchored myelin enzyme 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (cnpase) was discovered in the early 1960s and has since then troubled scientists with its peculiar catalytic activity and high expression levels in the central nervous system. despite decades of research, the actual physiological relevance of cnpase has only recently begun to unravel. in addition to a role in myelination, cnpase is also involved in local adenosine production in traumatic brain injury and possibly has a regulatory function in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. although research focusing on the cnpase phosphodiesterase activity has been helpful, several open questions concerning the protein function in vivo remain unanswered. this review is focused on past research on cnpase, especially in the fields of structural biology and enzymology, and outlines the current understanding regarding the biochemical and physiological significance of cnpase, providing ideas and directions for future research.
molecular_biology	we report a danio rerio transposon named drtrt, for d. rerio transposon related to tc1. the complete sequence of the drtrt transposon is 1,563 base pairs (bp) in length, and its transposase putatively encodes a 338-amino acid protein that harbors a dd37e motif in its catalytic domain. we present evidence based on searches of publicly available genomes that trt elements commonly occur in vertebrates and protozoa. phylogenetic and functional domain comparisons confirm that trt constitutes a new subfamily within the tc1 family. hallmark features of having no premature termination codons within the transposase, the presence of all expected functional domains, and its occurrence in the bony fish transcriptome suggest that trt might have current or recent activity in these species. further analysis showed that the activity of trt elements in these species might have arisen about between 4 and 19 ma. interestingly, our results also implied that the widespread distribution of trt among fishes, frog, and snakes is the result of multiple independent ht events, probably from bony fishes to snakes or frog. finally, the mechanisms underlying horizontal transfer of trt elements are discussed.
internal_combustion_engine	recently, as a kind of renewable fuel, low-grade biogas has been researched to apply in internal combustion engine. in this paper, an experimental study was conducted to study the influence of injection strategies on the efficient utilization of low-grade biogas in reactivity controlled compression ignition (rcci) mode with port fuel injection of biogas and in-cylinder direct injection of diesel based on a modified electronic controlled high-pressure directly injected compression ignition engine. considered the high proportion of inert gas in biogas, a four-components simulated gas (h-2:co:ch4:n-2 = 5:40:5:50 vol%) has been selected as test fuels to simulate biogas. the effects of several injection control parameters such as pilot injection timing, main injection timing, common rail pressure and pilot injection ratio on the combustion and emissions are analyzed in detail. the research demonstrates that the main injection timing can effectively control the combustion phase and excessive early pilot injection timing leads to retard of combustion. co emissions are relatively high due to homogenous charge of biogas. nox and smoke emissions can be effectively controlled. in rcci mode, the indicated thermal efficiency of biogas/diesel can reach 40%.

molecular_biology	the objective of the present study was to characterize the pattern of gene expression at the last stage of ovarian maturation in chlamys farreri. dynamic transcriptomic analysis of ovaries was performed at four time points prior to ovulation, using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform. a total of 174,928 unigenes were obtained, among which 42,534 were annotated according to bioinformatics databases, such as nt, nr, swiss-prot, kog, go, and kegg. results from the transcriptome analysis revealed a time-dependent pattern of global transcriptional responses. when compared to the 0 d library, 99, 152, and 3248 differently expressed genes (degs) were obtained in the 3, 10, and 21 d libraries, respectively. those three libraries shared only 10 degs, the majority of which were time-specific. pairwise comparisons of each profile demonstrated that degs were related to hormone metabolism and receptors, cell division, gametogenesis, and vitellogenesis pathways. notably, when adjacent sampling time point groups were compared, the only deg throughout the experimental period was related to the g protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. the present study provides the first dynamic transcriptomic analysis of c. farreri for evaluation of the molecular basis of gonadal maturation.

immunology	alzheimer 's disease patients display neuropathological lesions, including the accumulation of amyloid-beta (a beta) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles. although the mechanisms causing the neurodegenerative process are largely unknown, increasing evidence highlights a critical role of immunity in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease. in the present study, we investigated the role of regulatory t cells (tregs) on alzheimer 's disease progression. first, we explored the effect of tregs (cd4(+)cd25(+) t cells) and teffs (cd4(+)cd25(-) t cells) in an adoptive transfer model. systemic transplantation of purified tregs into 3xtg-ad mice improved cognitive function and reduced deposition of a beta plaques. in contrast, adoptive transfer of teffs diminished behavioral function and cytokine production. next, we transiently depleted treg population using an anti-cd25 antibody (pc61). depletion of tregs for four months resulted in a marked aggravation of the spatial learning deficits of six-month-old 3xtg-ad mice. additionally, it resulted in decreasing glucose metabolism, as assessed by positron emission tomography (pet) with f-18-2 fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([f-18] fdg) neuroimaging. importantly, the deposition of a beta plaques and microglia/macrophage was increased in the hippocampal ca1 and ca3 regions of the treg depleted 3xtg-ad compared to the vehicle-treated 3xtg-ad group. our finding suggested that systemic treg administration ameliorates disease progression and could be an effective alzheimer 's disease treatment.
cell_biology	background: in periodontal therapy enamel matrix derivative (emd) has been successfully used for tissue regeneration by altering activity of various cells involved in periodontal regeneration. studies have focused primarily on clinical parameters and outcome. effects of emd on oral epithelial cells are of crucial importance in order to understand the biology of regeneration. aims of this study are to investigate proliferative and cytotoxic effects of emd on oral epithelial cells and their possible influences on epithelial barrier function. methods: scc-25 cells, a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line, and primary keratinocytes were either treated with emd dissolved in culture medium or added to wells/inserts precoated with emd. cells were incubated for 24, 48, and 72 hours. proliferation rate was analyzed measuring the 5bromo-2'-deoxyuridine nucleotide uptake. cytotoxic effects of emd treatment were sampled by lactate dehydrogenase release. alterations of the epithelial barrier function induced by emd were investigated by analysis of transepithelial electrical resistance (ter). results: statistically significant inhibitory effects of both malignant and primary cell proliferation could be demonstrated by precoating culture plate wells with emd. no cytotoxic effects caused by emd were detected. precoating of inserts with emd induced a significant increase of ter and barrier function. conclusions: this investigation compares applying emd in solution to cells with precoating of wells with emd. when precoating of wells was used solely, inhibition of cell proliferation was evident. precoating may represent more suitable clinical usage. furthermore, prelayering emd induced an increase of ter of primary cells. these results suggest emd may enhance barrier function.
immunology	complement is the major humoral component of the innate immune system. it recognizes pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, and initiates the immune response in coordination with innate and adaptive immunity. when activated, the complement system unleashes powerful cytotoxic and inflammatory mechanisms, and thus its tight control is crucial to prevent damage to host tissues and allow restoration of immune homeostasis. factor h is the major soluble inhibitor of complement, where its binding to self markers (i.e., particular glycan structures) prevents complement activation and amplification on host surfaces. not surprisingly, mutations and polymorphisms that affect recognition of self by factor h are associated with diseases of complement dysregulation, such as age-related macular degeneration and atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome. in addition, pathogens (i.e., non-self) and cancer cells (i.e., altered-self) can hijack factor h to evade the immune response. here we review recent (and not so recent) literature on the structure and function of factor h, including the emerging roles of this protein in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases and cancer.
northern_blotting	this protocol describes how to perform northern blot analyses to detect micrornas and their precursors with single-nucleotide resolution, which is crucial for analyzing individual length variants and for evaluating relative quantities of unique micrornas in cells. northern blot analysis consists of resolving rnas by gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring and fixing to nylon membranes as well as detecting by hybridization with radioactive probes. earlier efforts to improve this method focused mainly on altering the sensitivity of short rna detection. we have enhanced the resolution of the northern blot technique by optimizing the electrophoresis step. we have also investigated other steps of the procedure with the goal of enhancing the resolution of rnas; herein, we present several recommendations to do so. our protocol is applicable to analyses of all kinds of endogenous and exogenous rnas, falling within length ranges of 20-30 and 50-70 nt, corresponding to microrna and pre-microrna lengths, respectively.
thermodynamics	performances of mesoporous materials in removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) from hot gases were evaluated systematically. the adsorption and desorption natures for pahs with different aromatic rings, naphthalene (nap), phenanthrene (phe) and pyrene (pyr) on mesosilicas mcm-41 and sba-15, and mesocarbon cmk-3, were studied. adsorption equilibria were well described by langmuir or freundlich model, giving the order of adsorption capacity of cmk-3 >sba-15 >mcm41 and pry >phe >nap. temperature programmed desorption exhibited the order of ease of desorption of sba-15 >mcm-41 >cmk-3, along with desorption kinetic triplet determined by combined model fitting analysis. the johnson-mehl-avrami (jma) rate equation was found to well describe pah desorption kinetics, except for phe/ sba-15 and pyr/cmk-3 due to potential blockage and strong binding, respectively. mcm-41 with simple 1-d mesoporous structure provided smooth diffusion and consistent behavior but very low adsorption capacity for each pah. sba-15 with micropores/small mesopores as interconnectivity between primary mesopores not only showed high sorption capacities but also diffusion advantages in desorption. cmk-3 with great microporosity facilitated the adsorption at low concentrations due to micropore-filling, and with surface hydrophobicity rendered high affinities especially for the bulkier pyr.
immunology	increasing evidence suggests that regular physical exercise suppresses chronic inflammation. however, the potential inhibitory effects of swimming on dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced chronic colitis, and its underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. in this study, rats were orally administered dss to induce chronic colitis, and subsequently treated with or without swimming exercise. a 7-week swimming program (1 or 1.5 hours per day, 5 days per week) ameliorated dss-caused colon shortening, colon barrier disruption, spleen enlargement, serum ldh release, and reduction of body weight gain. swimming for 1.5 hours per day afforded greater protection than 1 hour per day. swimming ameliorated dss-induced decrease in crypt depth, and increases in myeloperoxidase activity, infiltration of ly6g(+) neutrophils and tnf-alpha- and ifn-gamma-expressing cd3(+) t cells, as well as fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin. swimming inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and decreased the protein expression of phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappa b p65 and cyclooxygenase 2, whereas it elevated interleukin-10 levels. swimming impeded the generation of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide; however, it boosted glutathione levels, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. additionally, swimming decreased caspase-3 activity and expression of apoptosis-inducing factor, cytochrome c, bax, and cleaved-caspase- 3, but increased bcl-2 levels. overall, these results suggest that swimming exerts beneficial effects on dss-induced chronic colitis by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.
human_metabolism	one hundred and eighty eight volatile organic compounds (vocs) were identified from dust emission, dust headspace, and in air sampling in a residence by sampling on tenax ta followed by thermal desorption and hrgc/ms. of these, 83 compounds were found in dust headspace. aliphatic aldehydes (c4-8) and octane were major contributors to headspace gas chromatograms while the total ion current response for desorbed vocs (120-degrees-c) was dominated by n-alkanes (c7-16), n- and branched alkanals (c4-10) and alkanoic acids (c2-c14). many of the identified vocs could be products of microbial or human metabolism. dust volatiles resulting from desorption were compared to dust headspace voc analyses and found to be comparable considering the temperature difference. a method for determination of total voc (tvoc-dust) emission at 120-degrees-c, was developed. variation in desorption tvoc analyses was mainly due to sample heterogeneity.
cell_biology	the cell lineage tracing system has been used predominantly in developmental biology studies. the use of cre recombinase allows for the activation of the reporter in a specific cell line and all progeny. here, we used the cell lineage tracing technique to demonstrate that chondrocytes directly transform into osteoblasts and osteocytes during long bone and mandibular condyle development using two kinds of cre, col10a1-cre and aggrecan-cre(ert2) (agg-cre(ert2)), crossed with rosa26(tdtomato). both col10 and aggrecan are well-recognized markers for chondrocytes. on this basis, we developed a new method-cell lineage tracing in conjunction with fluorescent immunohistochemistry-to define cell fate by analyzing the expression of specific cell markers. runx2 (a marker for early-stage osteogenic cells) and dentin matrix protein1 (dmp1; a marker for late-stage osteogenic cells) were used to identify chondrocyte-derived bone cells and their differentiation status. this combination not only broadens the application of cell lineage tracing, but also simplifies the generation of compound mice. more importantly, the number, location, and differentiation statuses of parent cell progeny are displayed simultaneously, providing more information than cell lineage tracing alone. in conclusion, the co-application of cell lineage tracing techniques and immunofluorescence is a powerful tool for investigating cell biology in vivo.
northern_blotting	embryo implantation is a complex initial step in establishment of a successful pregnancy. many mrnas have been shown to be differentially expressed in the rat uterus during embryo implantation. however, the expression profiles of micrornas (mirnas), a key post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases are still unknown. here, an mirna microarray was used to examine differential expression of mirnas in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases. twenty-eight mirnas were up-regulated and 29 mirnas were down-regulated at least twofold during the receptive phase in rat uterus; these results were confirmed by northern blotting. mir-29a was only highly expressed in rat uterus during the implantation period, and activation of delayed implantation and artificial decidualization enhanced the mir-29a level. further investigation revealed that both the pro-apoptotic factor genes bak1 and bmf and the anti-apoptotic factor gene bcl-w are targets of mir-29a. there was weak binding between mir-29a and the 3 utr of the anti-apoptotic factor gene mcl1. over-expression of mir-29a inhibited the late apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells, which may be due to the stronger binding capacity between mir-29a and the 3 utr of pro-apoptotic factors than that between mir-29a and the 3 utr of anti-apoptotic factors. collectively, mir-29a plays an important role during embryo implantation by regulating both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. mir-29a may predominantly bind pro-apoptotic factors, leading to inhibition of cell apoptosis.

enzymology	valproic acid (vpa) is a simple branched medium-chain fatty acid with expanding therapeutic applications beyond its prime anticonvulsant properties. aims: (1) to resolve the underlying basis for the interference of valproate with the isoleucine degradative pathway and (2) to shed new light on the enzymology of the beta-oxidation pathway of valproate. methods: urine organic acids were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. in vitro studies were performed with heterologously expressed human 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase (mhbd) and fibroblasts from controls and a patient with mhbd deficiency using 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa and 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa as substrates. the respective enzymatic activities were measured using optimized hplc procedures. short-chain enoyl-coa hydratase (echs1) immunoprecipitation in a human liver homogenate was performed and hydratase activity was measured in the supernatants by hplc, using crotonyl-coa and delta(2(e))-valproyl-coa as substrates. results: patients on valproate therapy had a moderately increased urinary excretion of the isoleucine metabolite 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid. mhbd was found to convert 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa into 3-ketovalproyl-coa. mhbd activity in control fibroblasts was comparable using both 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa and 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa as substrates. in fibroblasts of a patient with mhbd deficiency, there was no detectable mhbd activity when 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa was used as substrate. samples with immunoprecipitated crotonase had no detectable hydratase activity using both crotonyl-coa and delta(2(e))-valproyl-coa as substrates. discussion: this work demonstrates for the first time, that mhbd is the unique enzyme responsible for the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa. furthermore, we show that crotonase is the major, if not the single hydratase involved in vpa beta-oxidation, next to its role in isoleucine catabolism.

northern_blotting	gap junctions are clusters of intercellular channels that are associated with embryonic development and neural signaling. innexins, invertebrate gap junction proteins, have been identified in drosophila and caenorhabditis. here, we report the isolation and characterization of two novel members of the insect innexin family, bm inx2 and bm inx4, from embryos of the silkworm, bombyx mori, during the germ-band formation stage. bm inx2 is a single copy gene with one exon, while bm inx4 is a single copy gene with four exons and three introns. the predicted proteins show structural similarities with other innexin family members, including four transmembrane (tm) domains, two extracellular loops (els), one cytoplasmic loop (cl), and typical conserved amino acids. bm inx2 is phylogenetically orthologous to the other insect inx2 genes, but bm inx4 is not orthologous to any known innexin including dm inx4. interestingly, northern blotting and in situ hybridization showed that bm inx2 was variously expressed across all developmental stages and in various tissues, with high expression seen in the nervous system at the time of embryogenesis. in contrast, bm inx4 was transiently expressed at the germ-band formation stage of embryogenesis, and was specifically expressed in the ovary and testis during the larval and pupal stages. the isolation and characterization of these novel genes should form the basis for further study of the functional events that occur during development and neuronal communication in b. mori.

northern_blotting	background: the mda-7/il-24 receptor belongs to the type 11 cytokine receptor family, and its two heterodimeric receptors are il-22r1/il-20r2 and il-20r1/il-20r2. mda-7/il-24 receptor expression in liver cancer cell lines has not yet been described. this information may be helpful for further clinical gene therapy. methods: with normal skin total rna as template, the cdna sequences of il-20r1, il-20r2 and il-22r were amplified by rt-pcr. total rna was extracted from cultured liver cancer cell lines and a normal liver cell line, then detected by northern blotting, and the expression of mda-7/il-24 receptors was analyzed. results: plc/prf/5 and smmc-7721 expressed il-20r1; bel-7402, hep3b, hepg2, and plc/prf/5 expressed il20r2; and hepg2 and plc/prf/5 expressed il-22r. only hepg2 expressed the il-22r/il-20r2 receptor complex. plc/prf/5 completely expressed both heterodimeric receptors. huh-7, qgy-7701 and wrl-68 did not express the il-24 receptor. conclusion: complete mda-7/il-24 receptors are seldom expressed in liver cancer cell lines.
polymerase_chain_reaction	thioredoxin peroxidases (tpxs) play an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis and in protecting organisms from the accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ros). in this study, we isolated the thioredoxin peroxidase-3 gene of schistosoma japonicum, sjtpx-3. the open reading frame (orf) of sjtpx-3 was 663 bp encoding 220 amino acids with a molecular weight of 24.99 kda and an isoelectric point of 6.20. quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that sjtpx-3 was expressed in all different stages of the parasites, with highest expression in 35-day-old worms. the orf of sjtpx-3 was subcloned into pet-32a (+) vectors and expressed in escherichia coli. recombinant sjtpx-3 (rsjtpx-3) was expressed as a soluble protein with good antigenicity, as demonstrated by western blotting. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that sjtpx-3 was mainly localized on the tegument of the parasites. mice vaccinated with rsjtpx-3 had a 37.02% (p < 0.05) reduction in worm burden and 56.52% (p < 0.05) reduction in liver egg production compared with control, unvaccinated mice. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis demonstrated that rsjtpx-3 could induce high levels of anti-rsjtpx-3-specific igg, igg1, and igg2a antibodies. characteristic th1 and th2 immune response cytokines were detected by flow cytometry and were increased by rsjtpx-3. taken together, these results suggest that sjtpx-3 is an antioxidant enzyme responsible for protecting s. japonicum from oxidative stress. rsjtpx-3 may represent a potential vaccine candidate and/or new drug target for patients with schistosomiasis.
computer-aided_design	purpose - this paper aims to explore the feasibility of rapid prototyping for human hand bones and additional artery with topological preservation. design/methodology/approach - a serial of slices derived from spiral computed tomography human hand specimen was imported into 3dslicer 4.4.0 to obtain a three-dimensional virtual model. the model is exported as a standard template library file. additional arteries were structured according to the atlas and the bone model. then, a real model was printed based on the virtual model. measurements were approached in 11 parts of the virtual and real model. findings - there is no statistical difference between virtual and real model in 11 parts, and the topological characters were preserved. practical implications - this method can be used in reconstruction of clinical iconological blood vessel and anatomical education. originality/value - this paper shows that it is possible to keep the topological structure of blood vessel not only in painting but also in clinical data.
human_metabolism	science is beginning to understand how genetic variation and epigenetic events alter requirements for, and responses to, nutrients (nutrigenomics). at the same time, methods for profiling almost all of the products of metabolism in a single sample of blood or urine are being developed (metabolomics). relations between diet and nutrigenomic and metabolomic profiles and between those profiles and health have become important components of research that could change clinical practice in nutrition. most nutrition studies assume that all persons have average dietary requirements, and the studies often do not plan for a large subset of subjects who differ in requirements for a nutrient. large variances in responses that occur when such a population exists can result in statistical analyses that argue for a null effect. if nutrition studies could better identify responders and differentiate them from nonresponders on the basis of nutrigenomic or metabolomic profiles, the sensitivity to detect differences between groups could be greatly increased, and the resulting dietary recommendations could be appropriately targeted. it is not certain that nutrition will be the clinical specialty primarily responsible for nutrigenomics or metabolomics, because other disciplines currently dominate the development of portions of these fields. however, nutrition scientists' depth of understanding of human metabolism can be used to establish a role in the research and clinical programs that will arise from nutrigenomic and metabolomic profiling. investments made today in training programs and in research methods could ensure a new foundation for clinical nutrition in the future.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the animal selection with favourable phenotypes of the past has been, currently, replaced by the genotype selection on quantitative traits, assisted by the expanding molecular techniques in the context of livestock improvement. in this study, the c. 112t>c polymorphism in exon ii of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) gene was investigated in karagouniko and chios sheep breeds by using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp), and possible associations with milk traits were examined. in total, 125 blood dna samples were isolated for pcr-rflp analysis and the respective 217 milk samples' composition profile was obtained. the goodness of fit test to hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe) for beta-lg genotypes was estimated and associations found between beta-lg genotypes and raw milk composition. two alleles and three genotypes were observed (aa, ab and bb) in both breeds, and chios breed significantly deviated (p <= 0.05) from hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe). conclusively, linear mixed model analysis on samples, from both breeds collectively, showed significant effects of beta-lg genotype on lactose percentage and somatic cell count (scc), lactation stage on daily milk yield and protein, while the breed effect was significant only on daily milk yield.
fluid_mechanics	a tsunami is a series of great waves primarily caused by a major subduction-zone earthquake with large-scale displacement of the sea floor or by initiation of submarine landslides. many coastal areas in the western united states are subject to tsunami hazard that is infrequent but potentially extremely destructive. the public safety risk has been only partially mitigated through warning and preparedness of evacuation; there are many coastal communities in the states of alaska, washington, oregon, california, and hawaii where there is insufficient time for complete evacuation, and places of higher elevation and/or taller structures could provide life safety. community disaster resilience would also require that critical and essential facilities provide structural resistance to collapse. towards that goal, the tsunami loads and effects subcommittee of the asce/structural engineering institute (asce/sei) 7 standards committee has developed a new chapter 6 with design requirements for tsunami loads and effects, contained in the 2016 edition of the asce 7 standard minimum design loads for buildings and other structures [minimum design loads for buildings and other structures]. the asce 7-16 tsunami loads and effects chapter will become the first national, consensus-based standard for tsunami resilience for use in the states of alaska, washington, oregon, california, and hawaii. the purpose of this paper is to provide an explanation of the technical basis and methodology for tsunami-resilient design of critical and essential facilities, tsunami vertical evacuation refuge structures, and other multistory building structures. the asce 7 provisions for tsunami loads and effects implements a unified set of analysis and design methodologies with design maps based on probabilistic hazard analysis, loads based on tsunami physics, and a structural ultimate strength basis of design. probabilistic offshore tsunami amplitude maps and tsunami design zone inundation maps were developed using a method consistent with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the treatment of seismic source uncertainties. procedures for tsunami inundation analysis are based on using mapped values of offshore tsunami amplitude or the runup and inundation limit shown in tsunami design zone maps. the asce 7 tsunami loads and effects chapter is consistent with the principles of probabilistic hazard analysis, tsunami physics, and fluid mechanics, integrated into a comprehensive set of design provisions.
southern_blotting	two germinating seed transformation methods i.e., scarifying and puncturing methods, were used to transfer the bar gene into an inbred maize line. we generated transgenic glufosinate-tolerant maize plants, and conducted a comparison of the two transformation methods. we used the plasmid pcambar.chi.11 as the donor and germinating maize seeds as the recipients. the germinating seeds were subjected to puncture or scarifying treatment after being soaked in water for 12 h. the injured seeds were co-cultivated with agrobacterium for 24 h and then sown in the experimental plots. putative transgenic maize plants were selected by basta tolerance screening and pcr detection, and were further confirmed by southern blotting. following glufosinate tolerance assay and molecular detection of transgenic lines of the transgenic seedling (t-0), first generation of transgenic seedling (t-1) and second generation of transgenic seedling (t-2), we have confirmed that the bar gene was stably inherited and expressed. the pcr amplification result for t-2 transgenic plants showed that the genetic segregation ratio of the bar gene followed the 3:1 ratio of a single dominant mendelian factor. the study proved that both the germinating seed treatment approaches are rapid and simple plant transformation methods. in particular, the application of the puncture method can expand the tissue culture free transformation to dicotyledonous plants.

genetics	although metagenomics is a relatively new scientific trend, it has managed to become popular in many countries, including russia, over its 20-year history. this division of molecular genetics studies ecosystem-extracted nucleic acids (dna and rna), which contain full information about the microbial community of a habitat. owing to metagenomic methods, soil microbiology has undertaken to study not only known cultivated types of microorganisms but also noncultivated forms, the biological properties of which can be suggested exclusively from the genetic information coded in their dna. it turns out that such ""phantom"" types constitute the overwhelming majority within soil microbial communities; to all appearances, they actively participate in ensuring soil fertility, and, hence, in the opinion of the authors of this paper, study of them is topical for both basic research and agricultural practice. the development of metagenomic technologies will help understand biological phenomena determined by close plant-microbe interactions, such as increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and protecting them against phytopathogens. however, the introduction of new methods has always presented difficulties; in metagenomics, they are associated with the acquisition, storage, and bioinformational analysis of a huge array of genetic information.
immunology	background: the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, encoded by slc10a1, was identified as a functional receptor for hepatitis b virus (hbv). the objective of this study was to determine if there was an association of the ser267phe variant (rs2296651) with hbv infection status in moroccan patients. methods: using a taqman 5' allelic discrimination assay, the ser267phe variant was genotyped in 286 chronic hepatitis b patients, 135 individuals with spontaneous clearance from hbv infection and 109 healthy controls negative for hepatitis b serological markers. results: in this cohort, we detected only wild-type genotype (s267s) in all groups. this polymorphism was not associated with the hbv infection status in moroccan patients. conclusions: the s267f variant is absent among moroccans regardless of chronic hbv infection status.
molecular_biology	mammalian cell cultures are the preferred expression systems for the production of biopharmaceuticals requiring posttranslational processing. usually, cell cultures are cultivated in medium supplemented with serum, which supports cell proliferation, viability, and productivity. however, due to scientific and regulatory concerns, serum-free conditions are required in recombinant protein production. cell lines that are intended for commercial recombinant protein production have to adapt to serum- or protein-free conditions early in their development. this is a labor- and time-consuming process because of the specific cell requirements related to their adaptation in new microenvironment. in the present study, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell line producing glycosylated recombinant human erythropoietin (rhepo) was adapted for growth and rhepo production in serum- and protein-free conditions. the physiology, growth parameters, and morphology of the cho cells and rhepo biosynthesis and structure were closely monitored during the adaptation process to avoid unwanted selection of cell subpopulations. the results showed that the cho cells were successfully adapted to suspension growth and rhepo production in the protein-free conditions and that the structure of rhepo remained nearly unchanged. in addition, during rhepo production in the protein-free suspension conditions, the agitation rate seem to be significant for optimal process performance in contrast to the initial cell concentration, evaluated through evolutionary operation method.

polymerase_chain_reaction	irrigation water has been recognized as an important microbial risk factor for fruits and vegetables in many production areas, but there is still a lack of information about how the microbiological quality of different irrigation water sources and climatic conditions influence the safety of vegetables produced in brazil. this study evaluated the distribution of generic e. coli and the prevalence of e. coil o157:h7 in two different water sources (ponds and streams bordering farmlands and urban areas) used for irrigation and on commercially produced lettuces in southern brazil. we also evaluated the effect of agricultural factors and meteorological conditions in the potential contamination of water and produce samples. a longitudinal study was conducted on four farms during a year (july 2014 to august 2015). the results showed generic e. coli prevalence of 84.8% and 38.3% in irrigation water samples and on lettuces, respectively, indicating irrigation water as an important source of contamination of lettuces. no significant differences were detected in the counts of e. coli between the two different surface water sources. the climatic conditions, particularly rainfall and environmental temperature, have influenced the high concentration of e. coil. the highest loads of e. coil in irrigation water and on lettuces were found during the warmest time of the year. e. coli o157:h7 was detected by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) in 13 water samples but only 4 were confirmed by isolation in culture media.

northern_blotting	northern blotting analysis is a classical method for analysis of the size and steady-state level of a specific rna in a complex sample. in short, the rna is size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis and transferred by blotting onto a membrane to which the rna is covalently bound. then, the membrane is analysed by hybridization to one or more specific probes that are labelled for subsequent detection. northern blotting is relatively simple to perform, inexpensive, and not plagued by artefacts. recent developments of hybridization membranes and buffers have resulted in increased sensitivity closing the gap to the more laborious nuclease protection experiments.
northern_blotting	knowledge of molecular mechanism(s) implicated in smokeless tobacco (st) associated oral carcinogenesis is meager. in an attempt to identify genes that are modulated by st, we recently reported establishment of an oral epithelial cell culture. amol iii from oral hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis of a khaini consumer. herein we aimed to identify novel molecular targets of st (khaini) in amol iii cells using differential display. fourteen novel differentially expressed genes (12 upregulated and 2 downregulated) were identified. these differentially expressed cdnas were amplified. cloned. sequenced and confirmed by reverse northern blotting. mainly these genes are components of transcriptional machinery. cell-cell adhesion. signaling, growth and transformation processes. the important novel molecular targets identified included activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule (alcani). cdp-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyl transferase (phosphatidylinositol synthase). cdipt an important enzyme in phosphatidyl inositol biosynthesis, ribosomal protein (rps23), kiaa0121 and growth and transformation factor. e2ig5. semi-quantitative rtpcr analysis of these five genes confirmed over-expression of these genes in oral pre-malignant lesions (opls) and oral squamous cell carcinomas (osccs) of st consumers underscoring their biological relevance in st-associated oral tumorigenesis. in depth studies are warranted to determine the functional significance of alcam and cdipt in oral carcinogenesis.

hydraulics	one of the most critical aspects in the drilling operation is to reduce the nonproductive time and to avoid the borehole instability issues such as kicks, blow outs, lost circulation, stuck pipe, and breakouts. to investigate these problems, one has to understand the formation properties, fluid hydraulics, and the basic mechanics behind drilling a well. in the previous research on this field, the factors were widely discussed and results obtained were related to the formation properties. however, while considering the stresses in the wellbore, the mechanical factors such as the rpm and contact of casing at different positions in wellbore have usually been neglected. in furtherance to this study, the importance of thermal condition, fluid loss, and filter cake formation study cannot be out ruled. this work includes a new insight toward understanding the stress redistribution due to pipe contact by the wellbore and smear mechanism. additionally, it presents the numerical analysis of influence of casing contact and downhole thermal conditions using the finite-element analysis. the classical equations used to obtain the wellbore stresses include very few parameters such as the far-field stresses, pore pressure, and wellbore geometry. they do not consider the influence of casing contact while drilling, mud-cake permeability, and elastic and inelastic properties of the formation. to take into account the effects of these parameters, finite-element analysis is carried out considering the above-mentioned parameters in various scenarios. the main objective of these simulations is to investigate the hypothesis of the increase in hoop stress considering casing contact with regard to formation stresses orientation. the study of different cases shows the variation of a few hundred psi of hoop stress. however, the thermal effect on the near-wellbore stress regions can be important for drilling in deep water and other complex drilling environments. to see the thermal effect, this study develops a thermo-poroelastic model. it is found that there is decrease in radial stress and hoop stress in near-wellbore region with time. this reduction will have a considerable impact on fracture initiation pressure in the near-wellbore region. also, the smearing effect will be influenced by stress changes due to change in temperature.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: to investigate the effect of htra1 on the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of human retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) cells in the light injured model, as well as the expression of the apoptosis related molecules. methods: the human rpe cell line arpe-19 was exposed to blue light to establish the light injured model. the cells were transfected with htra1 sirna to knockdown htra1 expression. subsequent expression of htra1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) and western blot, respectively. changes in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (cck-8), transwell assay and flow cytometry respectively, as well as changes in the mrna and protein levels of bax, caspase-3 and bcl-2 expression. results: htra1 was highly expressed in arpe-19 cells after blue light irradiation. knockdown of htra1 expression inhibited the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of the blue-light-irradiated arpe-19 cells (p<0.05). bax and caspase-3 expression were significantly reduced both at mrna and protein levels (p<0.05) after sirna treatment. bcl-2 expression significantly increased in blue-light irradiated arpe-19 cells after sirna interference (p<0.05). conclusion: silence of htra1 may inhibit the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of arpe-19 cells in light injured model. moreover, htra1 suppression in blue-light irradiated arpe-19 cells may ameliorate cell apoptosis through down-regulation of bax and caspase-3, and up regulation of bcl-2 expression.
immunology	background adrenaline auto-injectors (aai) should be provided to individuals considered to be at high risk of anaphylaxis. there is some evidence that the rate of aai prescription is increasing, but the true extent has not been previously quantified. aim to estimate the trends in annual gp-issued prescriptions for aai among uk children between 2000 and 2012. design and setting retrospective cohort study using data from primary care practices that contributed to the health improvement network (thin) database. method children and young people aged between 0-17 years of age with a prescription for aais were identified, and annual aai device prescription rates were estimated using stata (version 12). results a total of 1.06 million uk children were identified, providing 5.1 million person years of follow-up data. overall, 23 837 children were deemed high risk by their gps, and were prescribed 98 737 aai devices. this equates to 4.67 children (95% confidence interval [ci] = 4.66 to 4.69), and 19.4 (95% ci = 19.2 to 19.5) devices per 1000 person years. between 2000 and 2012, there has been a 355% increase in the number of children prescribed devices, and a 506% increase in the total number of aai devices prescribed per 1000 person years in the uk. the number of devices issued per high-risk child during this period has also increased by 33%. conclusion the number of children being prescribed aai devices and the number of devices being prescribed in uk primary care between 2000 and 2012 has significantly increased. a discussion to promote rational prescribing of aais in the nhs is needed.
computer-aided_design	this paper deals with the study of a process that allows the use of waste sulphates from drywalls and plasterboards in the cement chemistry without affecting the resistance of cement, since cement industry is an important sulphate consumer. the role of the recycling temperature to obtain recycled calcium sulphates (rcs) and their so3 contents, when rcs are used as set retarders in cements, is also studied. gypsum from drywalls, and plaster of paris from plasterboards, were heated at three recycling temperatures (110 degrees c - 150 degrees c - 170 degrees c) and partially dehydrated to obtain rcs. chemical composition and so3 purity of these rcs and of natural gypsums were determined and compared via xrd and dsc/tg. setting time, the compressive strengths and the microstructure of cements with rcs used as set retarder were studied. the main products formed after cement hydration were determined by xrd and their microstructure observed by sem/edx. internal porosity of different blends, area per mm(2) and diameter distribution, was determined through image processing with computer-aided design (cad) software in sem images. cements with rcs from plasterboards as set retarder, with the higher so3 content and higher amount of hemihydrates, preheated at 150-170 degrees c, have mechanical strengths according to cement standards. they show a denser microstructure, lower porosity and more homogeneous matrix after final setting than cements with rcs from drywalls. the selection here suggested of waste sulphates and the preheating process will allow using recycled sulphates from debris in the cement industry, according to eu standards.

southern_blotting	horizontal gene transfer may occur between distantly related bacteria, thus leading to genetic plasticity and in some cases to acquisition of novel resistance traits. proteus mirabilis is an enterobacterial species responsible for human infections that may express various acquired beta-lactam resistance genes, including different classes of carbapenemase genes. here we report a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate (strain 1091) displaying resistance to penicillin, including temocillin, together with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems and susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. using biochemical tests, significant carbapenem hydrolysis was detected in p. mirabilis 1091. since pcr failed to detect acquired carbapenemase genes commonly found in enterobacteriaceae, we used a whole- genome sequencing approach that revealed the presence of bla(oxa- 58) class d carbapenemase gene, so far identified only in acinetobacter species. this gene was located on a 3.1-kb element coharboring a bla(ampc)- like gene. remarkably, these two genes were bracketed by putative xerc-xerd binding sites and inserted at a xerc-xerd site located between the terminase-like small- and large-subunit genes of a bacteriophage. increased expression of the two bla genes resulted from a 6-time tandem amplification of the element as revealed by southern blotting. this is the first isolation of a clinical p. mirabilis strain producing oxa-58, a class d carbapenemase, and the first description of a xerc-xerd-dependent insertion of antibiotic resistance genes within a bacteriophage. this study revealed a new role for the xerc-xerd recombinase in bacteriophage biology.
machine_design	due to higher magnetic flux density, larger effective magnetic air gap, and lesser use of ferromagnetic materials, large-scale direct-drive superconducting (sc) wind generators have a very high peak fault current and torque, which pose a challenge for their armature windings and mechanical supports. understanding the behavior of the sc generators under faults is important for their application and commercialization. in this paper, a 13.2-mw direct-drive sc wind generator is analyzed under the three-phase symmetric short circuit using 2-d finite-element analyses. the key differences in the short-circuit behavior between sc generators and conventional machines are explained. the effects of a high fault torque on the cost and weight of a generator are also discussed. it is found that the higher fault current and torque in an sc generator are mainly caused by low reactances and nonnegligible armature resistance. generator parameters, including the use of ferromagnetic materials, the value of magnetic loading, the pole number, the number of turns per armature coil, and the number of armature winding sets, have a significant influence on reactances, fault current, and torque. the influences of these parameters on fault current and torque under the three-phase symmetric short-circuit are analyzed in detail. moreover, several ways to decrease the fault current and torque in terms of machine design are proposed.
hydraulics	in addition to buffering plants from water stress during severe droughts, plant water storage (pws) alters many features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of water movement in the soil-plant system. how pws impacts water dynamics and drought resilience is explored using a multi-layer porous media model. the model numerically resolves soil-plant hydrodynamics by coupling them to leaf-level gas exchange and soil-root interfacial layers. novel features of the model are the considerations of a coordinated relationship between stomatal aperture variation and whole-system hydraulics and of the effects of pws and nocturnal transpiration (fe,night) on hydraulic redistribution (hr) in the soil. the model results suggest that daytime pws usage and fe,night generate a residual water potential gradient (p,night) along the plant vascular system overnight. this p,night represents a non-negligible competing sink strength that diminishes the significance of hr. considering the co-occurrence of pws usage and hr during a single extended dry-down, a wide range of plant attributes and environmental/soil conditions selected to enhance or suppress plant drought resilience is discussed. when compared with hr, model calculations suggest that increased root water influx into plant conducting-tissues overnight maintains a more favorable water status at the leaf, thereby delaying the onset of drought stress.
enzymology	the reaction mechanism of arylmalonate decarboxylase is investigated using density functional theory calculations. this enzyme catalyzes the asymmetric decarboxylation of prochiral disubstituted malonic acids to yield the corresponding enantiopure carboxylic acids. the quantum chemical cluster approach is employed, and two different models of the active site are designed: a small one to study the mechanism and characterize the stationary points and a large one to study the enantioselectivity. the reactions of both a-methyl-a-phenylmalonate and a-methyl-a-vinylmalonate are considered, and different substrate binding modes are assessed. the calculations overall give strong support to the suggested mechanism in which decarboxylation of the substrate first takes place, followed by a stereoselective protonation by a cysteine residue. the enediolate intermediate and the transition states are stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds that make up the dioxyanion hole, resulting in feasible energy barriers. it is further demonstrated that the enantioselectivity in the case of a-methyl-a-phenylmalonate substrate is dictated already in the substrate binding, because only one binding mode is energetically accessible, whereas in the case of the smaller a-methyl-a-vinylmalonate substrate, both the binding and the following transition states contribute to the enantioselectivity.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the formation of the primary shell is a vital process in marine bivalves. ocean acidification largely influences shell formation. it has been reported that enzymes involved in phenol oxidation, such as tyrosinase and phenoloxidases, participate in the formation of the periostracum. in the present study, we cloned a tyrosinase gene from crassostrea angulata named ca-tyra1, and its potential function in early larval shell biogenesis was investigated. the ca-tyra1 gene has a full-length cdna of 2430 bp in size, with an open reading frame of 1896 bp in size, which encodes a 631-amino acid protein that includes a 24-amino acid putative signal peptide. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) analysis revealed that ca-tyra1 transcription mainly occurs at the trochophore stage, and the ca-tyra1 mrna levels in the 3000 ppm treatment group were significantly upregulated in the early d-veliger larvae. wmish and electron scanning microscopy analyses showed that the expression of ca-tyra1 occurs at the gastrula stage, thereby sustaining the early d-veliger larvae, and the shape of its signal is saddle-like, similar to that observed under an electron scanning microscope. furthermore, the rna interference has shown that the treatment group has a higher deformity rate than that of the control, thereby indicating that ca-tyra1 participates in the biogenesis of the primary shell. in conclusion, and our results indicate that ca-tyra1 plays a vital role in the formation of the larval shell and participates in the response to larval shell damages in crassostrea angulata that were induced by ocean acidification.

human_metabolism	this research, that is a framework of a big project regarding the knowledge of human metabolism in patients affected by renal disease, is aimed to assess the levels of some selected essential (co. fe. k, na, rb, se and zn) and non-essential elements (br cr, cs, fig, ni and sb) in different biological matrices such as whole blood, serum and urine, of three italian sub-populations. the analytical methodology involved is the instrumental neutron activation analysis (inaa), a primary analytical technique: the samples (totally 144) were irradiated in the triga nuclear reactor at the r.c.-casaccia enea for 12 h at a neutron flux of 2.6 x 10(12) n x cm(-2) x s(-1). the results show a similar distribution for essential elements whereas quite different for non-essential elements. the statistical treatment has evidenced no differences among the samples grouping the subpopulations into unique one. in this way, the levels found can be considered ""reference values"" in the investigated matrices.

immunology	the ocular surface is constantly exposed to environmental irritants, allergens and pathogens, against which it can mount a prompt immune response to preserve its integrity. but to avoid unnecessary inflammation, the ocular surface 's mucosal immune system must also discriminate between harmless and potentially dangerous antigens, a seemingly complicated task. despite its unique features, the ocular surface is a mucosal lining, and as such, it shares some homeostatic and pathophysiological mechanisms with other mucosal surfaces. the purpose of this review is to explore the mucosal homeostatic immune function of the ocular surface in both the healthy and diseased states, with a special focus on mucosal immunology concepts. the information discussed in this review has been retrieved by pubmed searches for literature published from january 1981 to october 2016.
materials_engineering	adolf martens (1850-1914) was a pioneer of materials engineering. after his studies in berlin he joined a railway company being responsible for the technical equipment. his interest for the basic mechanisms of mechanical strength and fracture of metallic materials led him to the development of the basic concepts for metallography; his papers published between 1878 and 1889 laid the fundament of this technique. in 1880 martens changed to the royal industrial academy in berlin and by 1884 he was designated as director of the materials testing laboratory at the technical university berlin. under his guidance this institution acquired an excellent reputation in all relevant areas of the german industry, forming the nucleus of the bundesanstalt fur materialforschung und - prufung (bam) - the federal institute for materials research and testing. martens developed equipment in many different areas as mechanical testing of metallic materials and of paper, characterization of the wear behavior of materials and viscosity of lubricants. his overwhelming contribution to materials engineering was recognized as early as 1895 by floris osmond, who denominated martensite a metallographical constituent resulting from quenching of steels. in 2000 iso designated the value obtained from the instrumented indentation method as martens hardness - hm.

human_metabolism	outer membrane proteins are structurally distinct from those that reside in the inner membrane and play important roles in bacterial pathogenicity and human metabolism. x-ray crystallography studies on 40 different outer membrane proteins have revealed that the transmembrane portion of these proteins can be constructed from either -sheets or less commonly from -helices. the most common architecture is the -barrel, which can be formed from either a single anti-parallel sheet, fused at both ends to form a barrel or from multiple peptide chains. outer membrane proteins exhibit considerable rigidity and stability, making their study through x-ray crystallography particularly tractable. as the number of structures of outer membrane proteins increases a more rational approach to their crystallization can be made. herein we analyse the crystallization data from 53 outer membrane proteins and compare the results to those obtained for inner membrane proteins. a targeted sparse matrix screen for outer membrane protein crystallization is presented based on the present analysis.
manufacturing_engineering	since the birth of european higher education area (ehea), the higher education institutions of european countries have been involved in the complex process of re-designing of their curricula according to the new educational criteria oriented to the convergence of contents and methodologies in teaching university curricula. according to the principles pursued by the so named bologna process, the present work is focused on the description of experiences accumulated by these authors in adaptation of their courses of manufacturing engineering, as a previous stage to complete re-formulation of study plans for engineering programmes that are taught in escuela tecnica superior de ingenieria industrial (etsii) of universidad politecnica de cartagena. the strategies followed for the enhancement of the interest of students towards the theoretical and practical teachings, and the promotion of traverse and specific competences specially associated to these courses are explained in this work, as well as the academic results provided by the new educational methodologies assumed for the teaching-learning process.
enzymology	the widespread use of phosphorothioate esters as agricultural pesticides, chemical weapons and mechanistic probes in enzymology has sparked interest in the reactivity of these thio-substituted analogues of phosphate esters. in this brief account, we summarize the recent developments in our understanding of the mechanisms of hydrolysis (and solvolysis in methanol) of phosphorothioates containing a sulfur atom in the bridging and/or non-bridging position. a small number of highly efficient catalytic systems containing the metal ions la(iii), pd(ii), cu(ii) and zn(ii) have been developed to promote the degradation of the various classes of phosphorothioate esters. the mechanisms of the base promoted solvolytic reactions in water and methanol and those of the metal catalyzed cleavage are presented, as well as a discussion of the energetics of the catalytic processes and other salient features. the aim of this review is to provide the reader with a-contemporary physical organic description of phosphorothioate ester cleavage. this article is part of a special issue entitled: chemistry and mechanism of phosphatases, diesterases and triesterases.

human_metabolism	background: n,n-diethyl-m-toluamide (deet) is a widely used insect repellent in the united states. objectives: to assess exposure to deet in a representative sample of persons 6 years and older in the u.s. general population from the 2007-2010 national health and nutrition examination survey. methods: we analyzed 5348 urine samples by using online solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution high -performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. we used regression models to examine associations of various demographic parameters with urinary concentrations of deet biomarkers. results: we detected deet in -3% of samples and at concentration ranges (>0.08 mu g/l-45.1 mu g/l) much lower than those of 3-(diethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid (dcba) (>0.48 mu g/l-30,400 mu g/l) and n,n-diethyl-3-hydroxymethylbenzamide (dhmb) (>0.09 mu g/l-332 g/l). dcba was the most frequently detected metabolite (similar to 84%). regardless of survey cycle and the person 's race/ethnicity or income, adjusted geometric mean concentrations of dcba were higher in may-sep than in oct-apr. furthermore, non-hispanic whites in the warm season were more likely than in the colder months [adjusted odds ratio (or) = 10.83; 95% confidence interval (ci), 3.28-35.79j and more likely than non-hispanic blacks (or = 3.45; 95% ci, 1.51-7.87) to have dcba concentrations above the 95th percentile. conclusions: the general u.s. population, including school-age children, is exposed to deet. however, reliance on deet as the sole urinary biomarker would likely underestimate the prevalence of exposure. instead, oxidative metabolites of deet are the most adequate exposure biomarkers. differences by season of the year based on demographic variables including race/ethnicity likely reflect different lifestyle uses of deet-containing products. published by elsevier ltd
northern_blotting	exposure of watermelon fruit to ethylene leads to acute placental-tissue softening and watersoaking. mrna differential display strategy was utilized to isolate and characterize genes associated with development of the disorder. watermelon fruit were harvested at the full-ripe stage and exposed to 50 mu ll-1 ethylene for 12 h, and 1, 3, and 6 d at 20 degrees c. dna-free total rna (0.2 mu g) isolated from fruit treated with air or ethylene for 12 h was reverse transcribed using three different one-base-anchored oligo dt primers. high stringency pcr was performed using eight different 13-mer arbitrary primers in combination with the fluorescent-labeled one-base-anchored oligo dt primers. the pcr fluorescent-labeled products were separated-on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and differentially expressed bands were isolated. confirmation of true positive bands was performed by reverse northern blotting. comparison of mrna profiles of ethylene- and air-treated fruit revealed that 78 genes were differentially expressed, of which 15 partial cdnas were isolated and characterized. blast search results revealed significant homologies to ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway genes, lipid-metabolizing enzymes, proteins involved in plant defense responses, radical scavenging enzymes, exonucleases, and expansins. northern blot analysis of rna isolated from air- and ethylene-treated fruit stored for 1, 3, and 6d revealed an ethylene-dependent expression pattern of all corresponding genes. the data indicate that ethylene treatment of watermelon fruit results in a rapid up-regulation of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes.

enzymology	plastids are complex organelles that are integrated into the plant host cell where they differentiate and divide in tune with plant differentiation and development. in line with their prokaryotic origin, plastid division involves both evolutionary conserved proteins and proteins of eukaryotic origin where the host has acquired control over the process. the plastid division apparatus is spatially separated between the stromal and the cytosolic space but where clear coordination mechanisms exist between the two machineries. our knowledge of the plastid division process has increased dramatically during the past decade and recent findings have not only shed light on plastid division enzymology and the formation of plastid division complexes but also on the integration of the division process into a multicellular context. this review summarises our current knowledge of plastid division with an emphasis on biochemical features, the functional assembly of protein complexes and regulatory features of the overall process.
manufacturing_engineering	an understanding of the hydraulic system is one of the learning objectives of the manufacturing engineering studies. generally, knowledge of the hydraulic system its components learned from textbooks. the existence of conventional tutorial props are considered can help the understanding of these materials, but this has not enough ability to give a clear illustration how each component in the system is working. this paper aims to look at how far a custom made hydraulic system tutorial props with a transparent flow concept can improve the competence of students in the understanding work of the hydraulic system. the tutorial props of hydraulic system are designed with the theme of material handling, using the robotic 3-arm with a dual-acting cylinder actuator to support the movement of each arm. all components flowed by fluid including valves, hoses, pumps, and actuators are made from transparent material and flowed with visible-colored fluid. the whole system and each component are equipped with a label containing its name and schematic symbol with fluid flow direction. the tutorial props can be operated manually and designed to be easily knocked down. based on verification using the questionnaire of technology acceptance model (tam) to 30 students obtained a value of 3.52 which indicates that the tutorial props are quite acceptable. while based on implementation test by comparing the difference in value between the pretest and posttest of 15 students using textbooks learning method and 15 students using the tutorial props learning method, found that there are significant differences which indicate that using the tutorial props is a better learning method.

computer-aided_design	the success of total knee arthroplasty (tka) depends on many factors. the position of a prosthesis is vitally important. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the value of a computer-aided establishing lower extremity mechanical axis in tka using digital technology. a total of 36 cases of patients with tka were randomly divided into the computer-aided design of navigation template group (nt) and conventional intramedullary positioning group (cip). three-dimensional (3d) ct scanning images of the hip, knee, and ankle were obtained in nt group. x-ray images and ct scans were transferred into the 3d reconstruction software. a 3d bone model of the hip, knee, ankle, as well as the modified loading, was reconstructed and saved in a stereolithographic format. in the 3d reconstruction model, the mechanical axis of the lower limb was determined, and the navigational templates produced an accurate model using a rapid prototyping technique. the tha in cip group was performed according to a routine operation. ct scans were performed postoperatively to evaluate the accuracy of the two tka methods. the averaged operative time of the nt group procedures was min shorter than those of the conventional procedures ( min). the coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, posterior tibial slope were , , in nt group and , , in cip group, respectively. statistically significant group differences were found. the navigation template produced through mechanical axis of lower extremity may provide a relative accurate and simple method for tka.
genetics	improving the accuracy of phenotyping through the use of advanced psychometric tools will increase the power to find significant associations with genetic variants and expand the range of possible hypotheses that can be tested on a genome-wide scale. multivariate methods, such as structural equation modeling (sem), are valuable in the phenotypic analysis of psychiatric and substance use phenotypes, but these methods have not been integrated into standard genome-wide association analyses because fitting a sem at each single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) along the genome was hitherto considered to be too computationally demanding. by developing a method that can efficiently fit sems, it is possible to expand the set of models that can be tested. this is particularly necessary in psychiatric and behavioral genetics, where the statistical methods are often handicapped by phenotypes with large components of stochastic variance. due to the enormous amount of data that genome-wide scans produce, the statistical methods used to analyze the data are relatively elementary and do not directly correspond with the rich theoretical development, and lack the potential to test more complex hypotheses about the measurement of, and interaction between, comorbid traits. in this paper, we present a method to test the association of a snp with multiple phenotypes or a latent construct on a genome-wide basis using a diagonally weighted least squares (dwls) estimator for four common sems: a one-factor model, a one-factor residuals model, a two-factor model, and a latent growth model. we demonstrate that the dwls parameters and p-values strongly correspond with the more traditional full information maximum likelihood parameters and p-values. we also present the timing of simulations and power analyses and a comparison with and existing multivariate gwas software package.
hydraulics	longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles of alluvial channels are altered by the presence of seepage. however, the available literature suggests that seepage has not been considered in analyses of bank profiles of threshold alluvial channels. in the experimental study reported here, downward seepage was applied to parabolic channels based on tractive force theory in order to determine its effect on the longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles. it was observed that sediment transport in the threshold channels increased when downward seepage was applied. the parabolic shape did not hold, but channels formed a new cross-sectional shape with a flat bed and two curved banks and achieved stability. the reason for the increased sediment transport in a threshold channel after the application of downward seepage was sought by analysing the time-averaged velocities. an empirically derived exponential expression was developed for the bank profiles of threshold alluvial channels affected by seepage. a relationship among hydraulic parameters for a stable channel with downward seepage is also suggested on the basis of the experimental observations.
machine_design	stator winding structure and its manufacturing in permanent magnet synchronous machines (pmsm) is the vital part of the whole machine design. it is important to follow particular procedures in order to keep the winding losses at the acceptable level, which include dc resistance loss and additional losses due to alternative magnetic flux within the area of the stator winding. the winding transposition or using of litz wire, which is effective way of proximity loss suppression, sometimes cannot be implemented due to challenges in assembling or cost aspects (especially in low cost pmsm solutions). in this case it is important to know consequences of using straight (non-twisting) windings in pmsms with relatively high electrical frequency. this article studies impact of the number of stator winding parallel strands on the additional ac losses distribution in the slot where this winding is located. also, thermal condition (which impacts the life time of the insulation) of the winding is analyzed with different number of parallel strands. current and temperature distributions in the slot conductors were attained by finite element method (fem). the total losses caused by additional ac losses in the winding were compared with the measurements results.
northern_blotting	to gain insight into the comparative function in stress response of hsps in insects, three hsp cdnas were cloned from the fat body of the beet armyworm spodoptera exigua (lepidoptera, noctuidae). sexhsp70, sexhsp74 and sexhsp83 cdnas encoding the protein of 667, 685 and 717 amino acids, with the pi of 5.52, 5.75 and 5.02, respectively. northern blotting revealed that all three sexhsp mrnas are expressed in the fat body, mid-gut, spermary and tracheae. sexhsp70, sexhsp74and sexhsp83 mrnas were expressed in the fat body and whole body at different levels during different developmental stages. the three sexhsp transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body on the first day of fifth instar larvae, on the fourth and seventh days of the pupa stage, and in the whole body on the initial stages of larvae. under heat and cold shock conditions, sexhsp70 and sexhsp83 mainly functioned during heat shock and cooling and sexhsp83 also had a function in the recovery stage. sexhsp74 had important functions in short-term heat shock and recovery, as well as long-term cooling. the results revealed that long-term shocking can affect sexhsp74 and sexhsp83 expression and long-term cooling can influence sexhsp83 expression during the recovery stage. published by elsevier inc.
human_metabolism	the antioxidant activities of crude extract and its derived soluble fractions from the flower of sophora viciifolia were evaluated in five different test systems (dpph, abts, frap, reducing power and inhibition of lipid peroxidant models) for the first time. the ethylacetate soluble fraction exhibited the highest antioxidant effect. correlation analysis suggested that the flavonoids might be the major contributors for the high antioxidant activity of this flower. in addition, 11 compounds were isolated from this flower, and the antioxidant capacities of 5 flavonoids were evaluated by dpph assay. compound 3 (luteolin) had a significant dpph radical-scavenging activity, and was also present at the highest concentration (5.56 mg/g dry sample), implying an important role of 3 for the antioxidant activity of this flower. the study suggests that the flower of s. viciifolia can provide valuable functional ingredients and can be used for the prevention of diseases related to various oxidant by-products of human metabolism.

molecular_biology	gene promoters have variable repartition of agct nucleotides according to some probabilistic behaviours essentially depending on their position in a string. the paper aims to provide a model for this configuration. with this model we derive non-uniform confidence bounds for those probability distributions in the strings. a uniform bound deriving from previous works in wu and zhao [inference of trends in time series. j r stat soc b. 2007; 69: 391-410] is more demanding for the model. a data-based study allows to clarify our suggestions and open the way for applications in molecular biology.
southern_blotting	beckwith-wiedemann syndrome (bws) and silver-russell syndrome (srs) are caused by imprinting defects on chromosome 11p15.5. standard diagnostic tests for these syndromes include methylation analysis of the differential methylated regions of the h19 and kcnq1ot1 genes. traditionally this has been conducted by southern blot analysis. pcr-based methods greatly improve the turn around time of the test and require less dna. one of the newly emerging techniques for snp genotyping and mutation scanning, high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis, has been shown to be also applicable for methylation analysis. we tested methylation-sensitive hrm analysis as a method for the detection of methylation defects in a group of 16 bws and srs patients with known methylation status (determined previously by southern blotting), as well as 45 normal controls. hrm analysis was able to detect all methylation aberrations in the patients and appeared to be more sensitive than southern blotting. variation in normal controls is minimal and the presence of snps in the amplified fragment does not influence the outcome of the test. we conclude that methylation-sensitive hrm analysis is a robust, fast, sensitive and cost effective method for methylation analysis in bws and srs.
northern_blotting	the mrna differential display technique was used to identify genes from habanero pepper (capsicum chinense jacq.) seedlings whose expression is modified systemically by infection with the oomycete phytophthora capsici l. experiments with different oligonucleotide primer combinations revealed that no single gene was synthesised de nova. instead, the quantitative accumulation of multiple transcripts was found. from these transcripts, levels of a nitrate reductase (capsicum chinense nitrate reductase, ccnr), which has a high percentage of identity with other solanaceae nrs, showed a consistent increase a few hours after inoculation (hai) with p capsici. reverse northern blotting revealed the existence of basal levels of ccnr transcripts in different adult tissues; however, systemic levels rose dramatically after spraying seedlings with salicylic acid (sa) and ethephon (et) but not with methyl jasmonate (meja). both p capsici and defence phytohormones (dp) also modified nr enzymatic activity (nitrite:nad(+) oxidoreductase; ec 1.7.1.1) with similar kinetics. because the application of dp induced and activated the ccnr differentially, it is possible that the activity of ccnr is related to a specific host defence response.

hydraulics	vulnerability segmentation, the condition under which plant leaves are more vulnerable to drought-induced cavitation than stems, may act as a ""safety valve"" to protect stems from hydraulic failure. evergreen, winter-deciduous, and drought-deciduous tree species co-occur in tropical savannas, but there have been no direct studies on the role of vulnerability segmentation and stomatal regulation in maintaining hydraulic safety in trees with these three leaf phenologies. to this end, we selected three anacardiaceae tree species co-occurring in a chinese savanna, evergreen pistacia weintnanniifolia, drought-deciduous terminthia paniculata, and winter-deciduous lannea coromandelica, to study inter-species differentiation in leaf and stem hydraulic safety. we found that the two deciduous species had significantly higher sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity and leaf-specific hydraulic conductance than the evergreen species. moreover, two deciduous species were more vulnerable to stem cavitation than the evergreen species, although both drought-deciduous species and evergreen species had drought-resistance leaves. the evergreen species maintained a wide hydraulic safety margin (hsm) in stems and leaves; which was achieved by embolism resistance of both stems and leaves and isohydric stomatal control. both deciduous species had limited hsms in stems and leaves, being isohydric in the winter-deciduous species and anisohydric in drought-deciduous species. the difference in water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity between the leaves and the terminal stems (p5oleaf-stem) was positive in p weinmanniifolia and l. coromandelica, whereas. t paniculata exhibited a lack of vulnerability segmentation. in addition, differences in hydraulic architecture were found to be closely related to other structural traits, i.e., leaf mass per area, wood density, and sapwood anatomy. overall, the winter-deciduous species exhibits a drought-avoidance strategy that maintains the hydraulic safety of the more carbon-costly stems by sacrificing cheaper and more vulnerable leaves, while the evergreen species exhibits a hydraulic strategy of drought tolerance with strong stomatal regulation. in contrast, the drought-deciduous species lacks vulnerability segmentation and sheds leaves at the expense of top shoots during peak drought. this study demonstrates that even sympatric tree species that differ in leaf phenology can exhibit divergent adaptive hydraulic safety strategies.
machine_design	this paper presents the implementation of the taguchi method for a retrofit design of a line-start permanent magnet motor. to evaluate the viability of the method, the optimum designs obtained from both the taguchi and a traditional optimization methods are compared. this outlines the respective advantages and disadvantages of both methods. it shows that the taguchi method is an efficient and robust design approach and possesses some unique advantages compared to conventional design methods. a design sensitivity investigation regarding the variances of certain parameters, due to manufacturing tolerances and material properties discrepancies, is also presented using the taguchi method. from this investigation insight into the contribution of each parameter towards machine performance is gained for the steady-state performance of an embedded radial flux line-start permanent magnet motor.
materials_engineering	in the present investigation, sensing electrode of an electrochemical co2 gas sensor (plate type design) is engineered to overcome various observed failures such as dying out in short time due to au/pt diffusion into the material which discontinues the electrical contact and results into inadequate catalytic action. to improve the sensing electrode performance, a gradient sputtered au coat is applied over it with increasing thickness towards the centre of the pellet. in another design, au is loaded with varying concentration into the electrolyte material and its coat is applied on the electrolyte to overcome the diffusion. performance of different sensors with varied configuration of catalyst au is compared on the parameters namely stability and response time. the gradient sputtered electrode gave fast electrode kinetics, whereas sensor stability is found better for au loaded material. an insight into effect of au loading in the binary electrolyte (li2co3 +caco3) is obtained by complex impedance spectroscopy.
genetics	we aimed to identify whether the use of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (hct) impacts outcomes for multiple myeloma patients with gains of chromosome 1q (+1q). we retrospectively identified 95 patients, 21% having+1q. for patients with+1q, the overall response rate to induction was 85%, with 40% havingvgpr and 20% achieving a cr, similar to non+1q patients (p=.64). the median pfs from diagnosis with+1q was 2.1 years (95% ci: 1.2-not reached (nr)) vs 4.3 years (95% ci: 3.3 yrs-nr) without+1q (p=.003). median os from diagnosis was 4.4 years (95% ci: 2.9-nr) vs not reached, respectively (p=.005). on molecular analysis using the foundation one heme assay, the most common mutations seen in+1q patients included tp53 (38%) and kras (25%). overall, gain of 1q portends worse pfs and os which was not negated by auto hct. such patients will likely require additional therapy to improve their survival.
fluid_mechanics	a numerical analysis is presented of cell adhesion in capillaries whose diameter is comparable to or smaller than that of the cell. in contrast to a large number of previous efforts on leukocyte and tumor cell rolling, much is still unknown about cell motion in capillaries. the solid and fluid mechanics of a cell in flow was coupled with a slip bond model of ligand-receptor interactions. when the size of a capillary was reduced, the cell always transitioned to ""bullet-like"" motion, with a consequent decrease in the velocity of the cell. a state diagram was obtained for various values of capillary diameter and receptor density. we found that bullet motion enables firm adhesion of a cell to the capillary wall even for a weak ligand-receptor binding. we also quantified effects of various parameters, including the dissociation rate constant, the spring constant, and the reactive compliance on the characteristics of cell motion. our results suggest that even under the interaction between p-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (psgl-1) and p-selectin, which is mainly responsible for leukocyte rolling, a cell is able to show firm adhesion in a small capillary. these findings may help in understanding such phenomena as leukocyte plugging and cancer metastasis.
genetics	male breast carcinomas (mbcs) are rare neoplasms that account for 0.1% of all male cancers. still, there are 2000 new cases of mcb diagnosed annually in the united states. because of its rarity, data regarding the etiology, risk factors, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of mbc are limited. mbc shares some similarities with female breast carcinoma (fbc). this review will address the important clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features, genetics, management, and prognosis of mbc.
cell_biology	liver transplantation has been accepted as a useful therapeutic approach for patients with end-stage liver disease. however, the mismatch between the great demand for liver transplants and the number of available donor organs underscores the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies for patients with acute and chronic liver failure. the rapidly growing knowledge on stem cell biology has opened new avenues toward stem cell-based therapy for liver disease. as stem cells have capacity for high proliferation and multipotent differentiation, the characteristics of stem cells fit the cell therapy. several types of cells have been investigated as possible sources of liver regeneration: mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, liver progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and bone marrow mononuclear cells. in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that these cells have great potential as candidates of stem cell therapy. we reviewed the reports on clinical trials of cell therapy for liver disease that have been recently undertaken using mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow mononuclear cells, and liver progenitor cells. these reports have heterogeneity of description of trial design, types of infused cells, patient population, and efficacy of therapies. we addressed these reports from these viewpoints and clarified their significance. we hope that this review article will provide a perspective on the available approaches based on stem cell-based therapy for liver disease.
molecular_biology	the aim of this study was to detect the is900 region of mycobacterium aoium subsp. paratuberculosis (map) in bovine milk samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and conventional pcr, and to study the agreement between these tests. a total of 121 bovine milk samples were collected from herds considered positive for map, from the state of pernambuco, brazil. map dna was detected in 20 samples (16.5%) using conventional pcr and in 34 samples (28.1%) using qpcr. map dna was detected in all of the 6 animal farms studied. moderate agreement was found between qpcr and conventional pcr results, where the sensitivity and specificity of conventional pcr in relation to qpcr were 50% and 96.6%, respectively. thus, the is900 region of map was found in bovine milk samples from the state of pernambuco. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of map dna found in bovine milk in northeast brazil. we also demonstrated the qpcr technique is more sensitive than conventional pcr with respect to detection of map in milk samples.

human_metabolism	n-[(1s)-1-(aminocarbonyl)-2-methylpropyl]-1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1h-indazole-3-carboxamide (ab-chminaca) is a recently introduced synthetic cannabinoid. at present, no information is available about in vitro or in vivo human metabolism of ab-chminaca. therefore, biomonitoring studies to screen ab-chminaca consumption lack any information about the potential biomarkers (e.g.metabolites) to target. to bridge this gap, we investigated the in vitro metabolism of ab-chminaca using human liver microsomes (hlms). formation of ab-chminaca metabolites was monitored using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. twenty-six metabolites of ab-chminaca were detected including seven mono-hydroxylated and six di-hydroxylated metabolites and a metabolite resulting from n-dealkylation of ab-chminaca, all produced by cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes. two carboxylated metabolites, likely produced by amidase enzymes, and five glucuronidated metabolites were also formed. five mono-hydroxylated and one carboxylated metabolite were likely the major metabolites detected. the involvement of individual cyps in the formation of ab-chminaca metabolites was tested using a panel of seven human recombinant cyps (rcyps). all the hydroxylated ab-chminaca metabolites produced by hlms were also produced by the rcyps tested, among which rcyp3a4 was the most active enzyme. most of the in vitro metabolites of ab-chminaca were also present in urine obtained from an ab-chminaca user, therefore showing the reliability of the results obtained using the in vitro metabolism experiments conducted to predict ab-chminaca in vivo metabolism. the ab-chminaca metabolites to target in biomonitoring studies using urine samples are now reliably identified and can be used for routine analysis. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
thermodynamics	the rate of heat released during the combustion in diesel engines is important for many reasons, including performance evaluation, pollutant formation, and control. combustion in diesel engines can be generally divided into three phases: pre-mixed, diffusive or mixed-controlled, and late combustion. the objective of this paper is to estimate the rate of heat released by the fuel in a marine diesel engine, in order to identify the pre-mixed and diffusive phases, using the sampling importance resampling (sir) bayesian particle filter. experimental pressure data obtained from a piezoelectric sensor, installed in a research marine diesel engine (man innovator 4c), was used to feed the observation model in such bayesian approach. the evolution model for the pressure was formulated in terms of a set of ordinary differential equations, coming from the first law of thermodynamics, together with a random walk model for the unknown state variable. the proposed approach was able to identify the pre-mixed and diffusive combustion phases, for different engine loads. results were compared with a simple inversion procedure, showing a good agreement. the combustion ignition delay was also calculated, showing its variation with the engine load.
enzymology	single-molecule experimental methods have provided new insights into biomolecular function, dynamic disorder, and transient states that are all invisible to conventional measurements. a novel, nonfluorescent single-molecule technique involves attaching single molecules to single-walled carbon nanotube field-effective transistors (swnt fets). these ultrasensitive electronic devices provide long-duration, label-free monitoring of biomolecules and their dynamic motions. however, generalization of the swnt fet technique first requires design rules that can predict the success and applicability of these devices. here, we report on the transduction mechanism linking enzymatic processivity to electrical signal generation by a swnt fet. the interaction between swnt fets and the enzyme lysozyme was systematically dissected using eight different lysozyme variants synthesized by protein engineering. the data prove that effective signal generation can be accomplished using a single charged amino acid, when appropriately located, providing a foundation to widely apply swnt fet sensitivity to other biomolecular systems.
internal_combustion_engine	exergy analysis, which is based on the first and second thermodynamic laws, is a significant tool to assess energy systems. in this study, energy and exergy analyses of a compression ignition internal combustion engine operating with sunflower methyl and ethyl ester and their blends with diesel fuel no. 2 are investigated. results are presented as the first and the second law efficiency, effective work, and exergy destruction values at 10 different engine speeds. it is concluded that 75% and 50% ethyl ester blends are the most appropriate fuels for the engine in terms of its performance.
southern_blotting	tobacco bright yellow-2 (by-2) cells, one of the best characterized cell lines is an attractive expression system for heterologous protein expression. however, the expression of foreign proteins is currently hampered by their low yield, which is partially the result of proteolytic degradation. human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (hg-csf) is a hematopoietic cytokine. recombinant hg-csf is successfully being used for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in cancer patients. here, we describe a simple strategy for producing biologically active hg-csf in tobacco by-2 cells, localized in the apoplast of by-2 cells, as well as targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (er). er targeting significantly enhanced recombinant production which scaled to 17.89 mg/l from 4.19 mg/l when expressed in the apoplasts. southern blotting confirmed the stable integration of hg-csf in the by-2 nuclear genome, and the expression of hg-csf was analysed by western blotting. total soluble protein containing hg-csf isolated from positive calli showed proliferative potential when tested on hl-60 cell lines by mtt assay. we also report the potential of a fluorescence-activated cell sorting approach for an efficient sorting of the hg-csf-expressing cell lines, which will enable the generation of homogenous high-producing cell lines.
internal_combustion_engine	in asia, two wheelers are popular mode of transportation to a large group of people because of their relative affordability and ability to maneuver in heavy city traffic. however, the rate of fuel consumption and emission contribution by them, especially in urban areas need more attention to improve sustain ability of energy and air quality. recently, plug-in hybrid technology has been emerged as one of the most promising alternatives in reducing petroleum consumption and emission. this paper presents the implementation of plug-in hybrid technology on a two wheeler by formulation of novel control strategy suitable for indian city driving needs. experimental investigations on hub motor and ic (internal combustion) engine has been carried out to fix the change-over speed in hybrid mode, followed by road test on prototype vehicle. the performance of prototype vehicle on idc (indian driving cycle) simulated road pattern and actual road driving, confirmed the change-over speed of vehicle in hybrid mode. the converted plug-in hybrid electric two wheeler also demonstrated the drive strategy adopted for higher energy efficiency up to 2.5 times. so, plug-in hybrid electric two wheelers show significant improvements in fuel economy by replacing petroleum fuel with electricity for portions of trip to achieve nations' energy security.

strength_of_materials	effect of aging treatment on the microstructure, creep resistance, and high temperature mechanical properties of the mg-6zn-3cu alloy (zc63) with la- and ce-rich rare earth additions was investigated by impression creep and shear punch tests (spt). impression creep tests were performed in the temperature range 423-498 k and under punching stress in the range 150-700 mpa for dwell times up to 3600 s. the ultimate shear strength (uss) was measured by the spt in the temperature range 298-498 k. the results showed that aging treatment increased the shear strength of the cast alloys, whereas it had detrimental effects on the creep strength of materials. these observations were discussed on the basis of the microstructural features and phase constituents of the investigated alloys in the as-cast and aged conditions.

cell_biology	several previous studies outlined the importance of the histone h2a deubiquitinase mysm1 in the regulation of stem cell quiescence and haematopoiesis. in this study we investigated the role of mysm1 in t-cell development. using mouse models that allow conditional mysm1 ablation at late stages of thymic development, we found that mysm1 is intricately involved in the maintenance, activation and survival of cd8(+) t cells. mysm1 ablation resulted in a twofold reduction in cd8(+) t-cell numbers, and also led to a hyperactivated cd8(+) t-cell state accompanied by impaired proliferation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production after ex vivo stimulation. these phenotypes coincided with an increased apoptosis and preferential up-regulation of p53 tumour suppressor protein in cd8(+) t cells. lastly, we examined a model of experimental cerebral malaria, in which pathology is critically dependent on cd8(+) t cells. in the mice conditionally deleted for mysm1 in the t-cell compartment, cd8(+) t-cell numbers remained reduced following infection, both in the periphery and in the brain, and the mice displayed improved survival after parasite challenge. collectively, our data identify mysm1 as a novel factor for cd8(+) t cells in the immune system, increasing our understanding of the role of histone h2a deubiquitinases in cytotoxic t-cell biology.
enzymology	in the complex formed between the calcium cation (ca2+) and a deprotonated hishis dipeptide, the complex adopts a charge solvation (cs) structure. ca2+% a weak binding main group metal cation, interacts with the oxygens of the peptide carbonyl moiety and the deprotonated c-terminus. in contrast, the much stronger binding ni2+ cation deprotonates the peptide nitrogen and induces an iminolate (im) ligand structure in the [ni(hishis-h)](+) complex ion. the combination of infrared multiple-photon dissociation (irmpd) spectroscopy and quantum chemistry evidence these two representative binding motifs. the iminolate coordination pattern identified and characterized in the [ni(hishis-h)](+) complex serves as a model case for nickel complexes of poly-histidyl-domains and is thereby also of interest to better understand the fundamentals of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as well as of ni co-factor chemistry in enzymology.

internal_combustion_engine	the aim of this investigation is to study the performance of a twin-entry turbine under pulsed flow conditions. the ansys-cfx code is used to solve three-dimensional compressible turbulent flow equations. the computational results are compared with those of a one-dimensional model and experimental data, and good agreement is found.
genetics	rich ecotype collections are used for several plant models to unravel the molecular causes of phenotypic differences, and to investigate the effects of environmental adaption and acclimation. for the model moss physcomitrella patens collections of accessions are available, and have been used for phylogenetic and taxonomic studies, for example, but few have been investigated further for phenotypic differences. here, we focus on the reute accession and provide expression profiling and comparative developmental data for several stages of sporophyte development, as well as information on genetic variation via genomic sequencing. we analysed cross-technology and cross-laboratory data to define a confident set of 15 mature sporophyte-specific genes. we find that the standard laboratory strain gransden produces fewer sporophytes than reute or villersexel, although gametangia develop with the same time course and do not show evident morphological differences. reute exhibits less genetic variation relative to gransden than villersexel, yet we found variation between gransden and reute in the expression profiles of several genes, as well as variation hot spots and genes that appear to evolve under positive darwinian selection. we analyzed expression differences between the ecotypes for selected candidate genes in the gras transcription factor family, the chalcone synthase family and in genes involved in cell wall modification that are potentially related to phenotypic differences. we confirm that reute is a p.patens ecotype, and suggest its use for reverse-genetics studies that involve progression through the life cycle and multiple generations.
molecular_biology	3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-mst) was a novel hydrogen sulfide (h2s)-synthesizing enzyme that may be involved in cyanide degradation and in thiosulfate biosynthesis. over recent years, considerable attention has been focused on the biochemistry and molecular biology of h2s-synthesizing enzyme. in contrast, there have been few concerted attempts to investigate the changes in the expression of the h2s-synthesizing enzymes with disease states. to investigate the changes of 3-mst after traumatic brain injury (tbi) and its possible role, mice tbi model was established by controlled cortical impact system, and the expression and cellular localization of 3-mst after tbi was investigated in the present study. western blot analysis revealed that 3-mst was present in normal mice brain cortex. it gradually increased, reached a peak on the first day after tbi, and then reached a valley on the third day. importantly, 3-mst was colocalized with neuron. in addition, western blot detection showed that the first day post injury was also the autophagic peak indicated by the elevated expression of lc3. importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that injury-induced expression of 3-mst was partly colabeled by lc3. however, there was no colocalization of 3-mst with propidium iodide (cell death marker) and lc3 positive cells were partly colocalized with propidium iodide. these data suggested that 3-mst was mainly located in living neurons and may be implicated in the autophagy of neuron and involved in the pathophysiology of brain after tbi.
human_metabolism	pige and pixe techniques were employed to the study of elemental constituents of some traditional medicinal plants generally used in curing many diseases and ailments in southwestern nigeria. analyses were also carried out on commonly edible vegetables of medicinal and pharmacological importance. pige measurements were carried out using 3.5-mev collimated protons from the 7 mv cn van-de-graaff accelerator of infn, lnl, legnaro (padova), italy, whereas the pixe measurements were carried out using 1.8 mev from the 2.5 mv an 2000 van-de-graaff accelerator of the same laboratory. the results show that many of the medicinal plants contain elements of cardinal importance in human metabolism. the results from the vegetables also show the presence of vital elements that are needed for growth and development. in addition, some of the toxic elements, which include as, cd, hg, and so forth, were not detected. however, some of the recipes contain trace amounts of pb at very low concentrations. this calls for proper control of dose rates in some samples to prevent the attendant negative cumulative effects.
manufacturing_engineering	despite health and safety legislation and ergonomics regulations for several years many swedish companies are still unable to effectively prevent the consequences of poor ergonomics. corrective measures are often made (too) late when employees complain and work-related disorders have already occurred. besides, several studies have shown that poor ergonomics result in deteriorated assembly quality and reduced productivity and that late measures are often costly. other studies have proven that design engineers are often unaware of design consequences and do not know how to apply ergonomics principles in new product and production design. therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore what is required to improve the situation. one way to find out was to ask engineers involved in product and production development. thus, 64 engineers in design and manufacturing engineering in five swedish companies were interviewed about ergonomics conditions related to quality and productivity issues. in general, their answers unexpectedly demonstrated a fairly good awareness of the implications of poor assembly ergonomics but also that appropriate product and production design methods and tools to prevent these are missing. 58 of the respondents thought that poor ergonomics could result in reduced product quality. 47 stated that profitability calculations are necessary for changes of poor ergonomic solutions. 37 said that ergonomics risks are accepted due to lack of appropriate calculation methods. altogether, many suggestions emerged for how to improve product and production design methods and tools in order to achieve more complete and sustainable manufacturing solutions. relevance to industry: the relationship between ergonomics and assembly quality deserves more attention in order to achieve both good working conditions and sustainable and cost-efficient manufacturing solutions. assembly ergonomics and quality relationships must therefore be proactively considered already in early design phases of new product and assembly concepts.

molecular_biology	objective. to conduct a replication study and meta-analysis involving the study of mtdna variants in the radiographic progression of oa in different cohorts worldwide, including cohort hip and cohort knee (check), the oa initiative and a cohort from spain. methods. the influence of the haplogroups in the rate of radiographic progression at 96 months in 431 subjects from check was assessed in terms of kellgren and lawrence (kl) grade. progression was defined as a change from kl >= 1 at baseline to any higher grade during the follow-up. extended cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse the influence of mtdna variants in the rate of radiographic knee oa progression. a subsequent meta-analysis of 1603 subjects following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines was conducted to combine the data of individual studies. a sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the stability of the results. results. check subjects carrying the haplogroup t showed the lowest rate of radiographic knee oa progression [hazard ratio (hr) 0.645 (95% ci 0.419, 0.978); p < 0.05]. when pooled, subjects within the superhaplogroup jt showed the same trend [hr 0.707 (95% ci 0.501, 0.965); p < 0.05]. bmi [hr 1.046 (95% ci 1.018, 1.073); p < 0.05] and bilateral oa [hr 2.266 (95% ci 1.733, 2.954); p < 0.05] at baseline are risk factors for radiographic knee oa progression as well. in the meta-analysis there was a reduced rate of radiographic progression in subjects with haplogroup t [hr 0.612 (95% ci 0.454, 0.824); p = 0.001] or in the superhaplogroup jt [hr 0.765 (95% ci 0.624, 0.938); p = 0.009]. sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were robust. conclusion. the mtdna variants in the superhaplogroup jt associate with a reduced rate of radiographic oa progression. the mtdna polymorphisms in the superhaplogroup jt emerge as potential complementary genetic biomarkers for disease progression.
cell_biology	nfkb1, a component of the canonical nf-kappa b pathway, was recently reported to be mutated in a limited number of cvid patients. cvid-associated mutations in nfkb2 (non-canonical pathway) have previously been shown to impair nk cell cytotoxic activity. although a biological function of nfkb1 in non-human nk cells has been reported, the role of nficb1 mutations for human nk cell biology and disease has not been investigated yet. we decided therefore to evaluate the role of monoallelic nfkb1 mutations in human nk cell maturation and functions. we show that nfkb1 mutated nk cells present impaired maturation, defective cytotoxicity and reduced ifn-gamma production upon in vitro stimulation. furthermore, human il-2 activated nfkb1 mutated ni(cells fail to up regulate the expression of the activating marker nkp44 and show reduced proliferative capacity. these data suggest that nfkb1 plays an essential novel role for human nk cell maturation and effector functions.

genetics	species range limits often fluctuate in space and time in response to variation in environmental factors and to gradual niche evolution due to changes in adaptive traits. we used genome-wide data to investigate evolutionary divergence and species range limits in a generalist and highly dispersive fish species that shows an unusually wide distribution across arid and semi-arid regions of australia. we generated ddrad data (18,979 filtered snps and 1.725 million bp of sequences) for samples from 27 localities spanning the native range of golden perch, macquaria ambigua (teleostei; percichthyidae). our analytical framework uses population genomics to assess connectivity and population structure using model based and model-free approaches, phylogenetics to clarify evolutionary relationships, and a coalescent-based bayesian species delimitation method to assess statistical support of inferred species boundaries. addressing uncertainties regarding range limits and taxonomy is particularly relevant for this iconic australian species because of the intensive stocking activities undertaken to support its recreational fishery and its predicted range shifts associated with ongoing climate change. strong population genomic, phylogenetic, and coalescent species delimitation support was obtained for three separately evolving metapopulation lineages, each lineage should be considered a distinct cryptic species of golden perch. their range limits match the climate-determined boundaries of main river basins, despite the ability of golden perch to cross drainage divides. we also identified cases suggestive of anthropogenic hybridization between lineages due to stocking of this recreationally important fish, as well as a potential hybrid zone with a temporally stable pattern of admixture. our work informs on the consequences of aridification in the evolution of aquatic organisms, a topic poorly represented in the literature. it also shows that genome-scale data can substantially improve and rectify inferences about taxonomy, hybridization and conservation management previously proposed by detailed genetic studies.

polymerase_chain_reaction	hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive neoplasm and is one of the most common human cancers. recently, long non-coding rnas have been demonstrated to participate in pathogenesis of many diseases including the progression in several cancers. in this study, we found that the long non-coding rna colon cancer-associated transcript 1 was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (p < 0.05), and high colon cancer-associated transcript 1 expression level was positively associated with tumor volume (p < 0.05) and american joint committee on cancer stage (p < 0.05) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. luciferase reporter assays and rna-pulldown assays showed that colon cancer-associated transcript 1 is a target of mir-490-3p. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis indicated that colon cancer-associated transcript 1 regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 expression as a competing endogenous rna by sponging mir-490-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. furthermore, colon cancer-associated transcript 1 silencing decreased hepatocellular carcinoma cells proliferation and invasion and overexpression promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. these data demonstrated that the colon cancer-associated transcript 1/mir-490-3p/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 regulatory pathway promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. inhibition of colon cancer-associated transcript 1 expression may be a novel therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
machine_design	an integrated design platform for the newer type of machines is presented in this work. the machine parameters are evaluated out using developed modelling tool. with the machine parameters, the machine is modelled using computer aided tool. the designed machine is brought to simulation tool to perform electromagnetic and electromechanical analysis. in the simulation, conditions setting are performed to setup the materials, meshes, rotational speed and the excitation circuit. electromagnetic analysis is carried out to predict the behavior of the machine based on the movement of flux in the machines. besides, electromechanical analysis is carried out to analyse the speed-torque characteristic, the current-torque characteristic and the phase angle-torque characteristic. after all the results are analysed, the designed machine is used to generate s block function that is compatible with matlab/simulink tool for the dynamic operational characteristics. this allows the integration of existing drive system into the new machines designed in the modelling tool. an example of the machine design is presented to validate the usage of such a tool.
human_metabolism	a direct structural identification, and quantitative assessment below the 50 nmol/ml level, of the full pattern of renally excreted metabolites is made possible by c-13 nmr measurements of untreated urine samples when stable isotope-labelled (c-13) drug analogues are administered to humans. the full potential of the new ex vivo nmr approach is exemplified by a study, for a group of volunteers, of s-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine metabolism. the metabolic sulphoxidation pathway fo s-caroxymethyl-l-cysteine in man, accepted so far, needs to be profoundly revised on the basis of the c-13 nmr results.
northern_blotting	cell-to-cell trafficking through different cellular layers is a key process for various rnas including those of plant viruses and viroids, but the regulatory mechanisms involved are still not fully elucidated and good model systems are important. here, we analyse the function of a simple rna motif (termed 'loop19') in potato spindle tuber viroid (pstvd) which is required for trafficking in nicotiana benthamiana leaves. northern blotting, reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that unlike wild-type pstvd, which was present in the nuclei in all cell types, the trafficking-defective loop19 mutants were visible only in the nuclei of upper epidermal and palisade mesophyll cells, which shows that pstvd loop19 plays a role in mediating rna trafficking from palisade to spongy mesophyll cells in n. benthamiana leaves. our findings and approaches have broad implications for studying the rna motifs mediating trafficking of rnas across specific cellular boundaries in other biological systems.
northern_blotting	wu d, peng f, zhang b, ingram aj, kelly dj, gilbert re, gao b, kumar s, krepinsky jc. egfr-plc gamma 1 signaling mediates high glucose-induced pkc beta 1-akt activation and collagen i upregulation in mesangial cells. am j physiol renal physiol 297: f822-f834, 2009. first published july 15, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00054.2009.-glomerular matrix accumulation is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. we have recently shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) transactivation mediates high glucose (hg)-induced collagen i upregulation through pi3k-pkc beta 1-akt signaling in mesangial cells (mc). phospholipase c gamma 1 (plc gamma 1) interacts with activated growth factor receptors and activates classic pkc isoforms. we thus studied its role in hg-induced collagen i upregulation in mc. primary rat mc were treated with hg (30 mm) or mannitol as osmotic control. protein kinase activation was assessed by western blotting and collagen i upregulation by northern blotting. diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin. hg treatment for 1 h led to plc gamma 1 membrane translocation and y783 phosphorylation, both indicative of its activation. mannitol was without effect. plc gamma 1 y783 phosphorylation was also seen in cortex and glomeruli of diabetic rats. hg induced a physical association between egfr and plc gamma 1 as identified by coimmuno-precipitation. plc gamma 1 activation required egfr kinase activity since it was prevented by the egfr inhibitor ag1478 or overexpression of kinase-inactive egfr (k721a). phosphoinositide-3-oh kinase inhibition also prevented plc gamma 1 activation. hg-induced akt s473 phosphorylation, effected by pkc beta 1, was inhibited by the plc gamma inhibitor u73122. plc gamma 1 inhibition or downregulation by small interference rna also prevented hg-induced collagen i upregulation. our results indicate that egfr-plc gamma 1 signaling mediates hg-induced pkc beta 1-akt activation and subsequent collagen i upregulation in mc. inhibition of egfr or plc gamma 1 may provide attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.
enzymology	historically, the study of proteins has relied heavily on characterizing the activity of a single purified protein isolated from other cellular components. this classic approach allowed scientists to unambiguously define the intrinsic kinetic and chemical properties of that protein. the ultimate hope was to extrapolate this information toward understanding how the enzyme or receptor behaves within its native cellular context. these types of detailed in vitro analyses were necessary to reduce the innate complexities of measuring the singular activity and biochemical properties of a specific enzyme without interference from other enzymes and potential competing substrates. however, recent developments in fields encompassing cell biology, molecular imaging, and chemical biology now provide the unique chemical tools and instrumentation to study protein structure, function, and regulation in their native cellular environment. these advancements provide the foundation for a new field, coined physiological enzymology, which quantifies the function and regulation of enzymes and proteins at the cellular level. in this special edition, we explore the area of physiological enzymology and protein function through a series of review articles that focus on the tools and techniques used to measure the cellular activity of proteins inside living cells. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

polymerase_chain_reaction	we conducted a prospective study to assess the prognostic impact of selected copy number variations (cnvs) in stage ii-iii microsatellite stable (mss) colon cancer. a total of 401 patients were included from 01/2004 to 01/2009. the cnvs in 8 selected target genes, dcc/18q, egfr/7p, tp53/17p, blk/8p, myc/8q, apc/5q, erbb2/17q and stk6/20q, were detected using a quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction of short fluorescent fragment (qmpsf) method. the primary end-point was the impact of the cnvs on the 4-year disease-free survival (dfs). the recurrence rate at 4 years was 20.9%, corresponding to 14% stage ii patients versus 31% stage iii patients (p<0.0001). the 4-year dfs was significantly decreased in patients with a loss at dcc/18q (p = 0.012) and a gain at erbb2/17q (p = 0.041). the multivariate analysis demonstrated that stage iii, a loss at dcc/18q and a gain at erbb2/17q were independent factors associated with dfs. a combination of dcc/18q and erbb2/17q was also associated with relapse, with the hazard ratio increasing from 1 to 2.4 (95% confidence interval (ci), 1.5-4.1) and 3.1 (95% ci, 1.2-8.4) in the presence of 0, 1 or 2 alterations, respectively (p = 0.0013). cnvs in dcc/18q and erbb2/17q are significantly associated with dfs in stage ii-iii mss colon cancer.
southern_blotting	resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins (bscs) in enterobacteriaceae in companion animals has become a great concern for public health. to estimate the dissemination of bsc-resistant bacteria between dog and human, we examined the bsc-resistance determinants of and genetic similarities between 69 bsc-resistant escherichia coli isolates derived from canine rectal swabs (n = 28) and human clinical samples (n = 41). some e. coli isolates possessed bla(tem-1b) (14 canine and 16 human isolates), bla(ctx-m-2) (6 human isolates), bla(ctx-m-14) (3 canine and 14 human isolates), bla(ctx-m-27) (1 canine and 15 human isolates), and bla(cmy-2) (11 canine and 3 human isolates). the possession of ctx-m-type beta-lactamases was significantly more frequent in human isolates, whereas cmy-2 was more common in canine isolates. bacterial typing methods (phylogenetic typing, o-antigen serotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) showed little clonal relationship between canine isolates and human isolates. plasmid analysis and southern blotting indicated that the plasmids encoding cmy-2 were similar among canine and human isolates. based on the differences in the major beta-lactamase and the divergence of bacterial types between canine and human isolates, it seems that clonal dissemination of bsc-resistant e. coli between canines and humans is limited. the similarity of the cmy-2-encoding plasmid suggests that plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase gene transmission plays a role in interspecies diffusion of bsc-resistant e. coli between dog and human.

human_metabolism	scope: xanthohumol (xn) is a bioactive prenylflavonoid from hops. a single-dose pharmacokinetic (pk) study was conducted in men (n = 24) and women (n = 24) to determine dose-concentration relationships. methods and results: subjects received a single oral dose of 20, 60, or 180 mg xn. blood was collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. plasma levels of xn and its metabolites, isoxanthohumol (ix), 8-prenylnaringenin (8pn), and 6-prenylnaringenin (6pn) were measured by lc-ms/ms. xanthohumol (xn) and ix conjugates were dominant circulating flavonoids among all subjects. levels of 8pn and 6pn were undetectable in most subjects. the xn pk profile showed peak concentrations around 1 h and between 4-5 h after ingestion. the maximum xn concentrations (c-max) were 33 +/- 7 mg/l, 48 +/- 11 mg/l, and 120 +/- 24 mg/l for the 20, 60, and 180 mg dose, respectively. using noncompartmental modeling, the area under the curves (auc(0 ->infinity)) for xn were 92 +/- 68 h x mu g/l, 323 +/- 160 h x mu g/l, and 863 +/- 388 h x mu g/l for the 20, 60, and 180 mg dose, respectively. the mean half-life of xn was 20 h for the 60 and 18 h for the 180 mg dose. conclusion: xn has a distinct biphasic absorption pattern with xn and ix conjugates being the major circulating metabolites.
strength_of_materials	the presence of defects not only modifies the stiffness and strength of materials, but also changes their morphologies. the latter effect is extremely significant for low-dimensional materials such as graphene. we show in this work that graphene swells while point defects such as mono-vacancies are created at finite concentrations. the distorted geometry resulted from this areal expansion, in combination with the in-plane softening effect, predicts an unusual defect concentration dependence of stiffness measured for supported graphene membrane in nanoindentation tests, which leads to a defect-induced stiffening phenomenon. the mechanism is elucidated through an analytical membrane model as well as numerical simulations at atomistic and continuum levels. in addition to elucidate the counter-intuitive observations in experiments and computer simulations, our findings also highlight the role of defect-modulated morphology engineering that can be applied to design nanoscale material and structural applications.

internal_combustion_engine	this paper deals with the evaluation and analysis of a bottoming orc cycle coupled to an ic engine by means of conventional and advanced exergy analysis. using experimental data of an orc coupled to a 2 l turbocharged engine, both conventional and advanced exergy analysis are carried out. splitting the exergy in the advanced exergy analysis into unavoidable and avoidable provides a measure of the potential of improving the efficiency of this component. on the other hand, splitting the exergy into endogenous and exogenous provides information between interactions among system components. the result of this study shows that there is a high potential of improvement in this type of cycles. although, from the conventional analysis, the exergy destruction rate of boiler is greater than the one of the expander, condenser and pump, the advanced exergy analysis suggests that the first priority of improvement should be given to the expander, followed by the pump, the condenser and the boiler. a total amount of 3.75 kw (36.5%) of exergy destruction rate could be lowered, taking account that only the avoidable part of the exergy destruction rate can be reduced.

molecular_biology	the rhizobia are collectively comprised of gram negative soil bacteria that have the ability to form symbiotic nitrogen-fixing root and/or stem nodules in association with leguminous plants. the taxonomy of these bacteria is continually in a state of flux, in large part due to rapid development of refined molecular biology techniques. the isolation and characterization of new, and often different, legumes-nodulating bacteria on a variety of plant hosts has resulted in the naming of many new rhizobial species. here we update the taxonomy of the legume-nodulating bacteria and describe newly identified rhizobia capable of nodulating edible legumes and legume trees. in 1990, there was only one bacterial species that was known to nodulate common bean worldwide (rhizobium leguminosarum sv. phaseoli), one species that nodulated faba bean (rhizobium leguminosarum sv. viciae), and two species that nodulated soybean (bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhizobium fredii). today, nearly 14, 11, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3 and 2 species have been defined that are capable of nodulating common bean, soybean, cowpea, chickpea, peanut, lentils, faba bean and pea, respectively. the recent use of whole genome based taxonomy (genomotaxonomy) will surely change how we define this important group of bacteria. the identification of several rhizobial species that are able to nodulate and fix nitrogen with edible legumes may enhance the production of these crops and can compensate for worldwide deficiencies in human nutritional needs in the future.
fluid_mechanics	background and aims in vascular plants, important questions regarding phloem function remain unanswered due to problems with invasive experimental procedures in this highly sensitive tissue. certain brown algae (kelps; laminariales) also possess sieve tubes for photoassimilate transport, but these are embedded in large volumes of a gelatinous extracellular matrix which isolates them from neighbouring cells. therefore, we hypothesized that kelp sieve tubes might tolerate invasive experimentation better than their analogues in higher plants, and sought to establish nereocystis luetkeana as an experimental system. methods the predominant localization of cellulose and the gelatinous extracellular matrix in n. luetkeana was verified using specific fluorescent markers and confocal laser scanning microscopy. sieve tubes in intact specimens were loaded with fluorescent dyes, either passively (carboxyfluorescein diacetate; cfda) or by microinjection (rhodamine b), and the movement of the dyes was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. key results application of cfda demonstrated source to sink bulk flow in n. luetkeana sieve tubes, and revealed the complexity of sieve tube structure, with branches, junctions and lateral connections. microinjection into sieve elements proved comparatively easy. pulsed rhodamine b injection enabled the determination of flow velocity in individual sieve elements, and the direct visualization of pressure-induced reversals of flow direction across sieve plates. conclusions the reversal of flow direction across sieve plates by pressurizing the downstream sieve element conclusively demonstrates that a critical requirement of the munch theory is satisfied in kelp; no such evidence exists for tracheophytes. because of the high tolerance of its sieve elements to experimental manipulation, n. luetkeana is a promising alternative to vascular plants for studying the fluid mechanics of sieve tube networks.
human_metabolism	the analytical methodology for speciation of metals and metalloids associated with alkyl groups and biomacromolecules is critically reviewed. alkylated metals and metalloids are not only known to be produced by microbial methylation within most anaerobic compartments in the environment, but also in the course of enzymatic transformations during human metabolism. because of the toxicological relevance of these compounds present in trace to ultratrace concentrations, firm species identification and exact quantification are essential. while many instrumental techniques coupling chromatography (gc, hplc, ce, ge) with plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms) are available for quantification, methods used for structural identification often suffer from inadequate sensitivity (ei-ms, esi-ms, maldi-ms, ft-icrms). other problems encountered are sample derivatisation artefacts, lack of suitable standards for quantification, lack of equilibrium between spikes and sample, and the integrity of metal-protein association during separation, in particular during sds-page. selected application examples with respect to mercury and arsenic speciation will be discussed critically.
genetics	we report the discovery of the largest fern genome in tmesipteris obliqua (1c = 150.61 pg), a species belonging to the whisk-fern family, psilotaceae. its genome size estimated by flow cytometry is comparable with the largest genome so far reported for any eukaryote, in the monocot paris japonica (melanthiaceae; 1c = 152.23 pg). the addition of this new record doubles the range of genome size values so far encountered in ferns from 97.2-fold (0.77-74.84 pg/1c) to 196-fold (0.77-150.61 pg/1c). this finding emphasizes the importance of filling taxonomic gaps in our knowledge to uncover the full extent of genome size diversity across the different lineages of land plants.
enzymology	polyextremophilic organisms, such as haloalkaliphiles have focused attention due to their hydrolytic enzymes. the halophilic microorganisms include heterotrophic and methanogenic archaea; photosynthetic, lithotrophic, and heterotrophic bacteria; and photosynthetic and heterotrophic eukaryotes. halophiles and haloalkaliphiles are distributed throughout in hypersaline environments, natural hypersaline brines in arid, coastal, and even deep sea locations, as well as in man-made salterns. the microbes possess range of the biocatalysts which allow them to sustain under the prevailing extreme conditions. among the enzymes, proteases, carbohydrases, and peroxidases are the most cited candidates. the proteases widely occur in microbial world and play significant role in the processing and maintenance of large number of membrane proteins under the cellular conditions. besides, the proteases are among the commercially most viable enzymes and dominate the worldwide enzyme market. the proteases of halophilic and haloalkaliphilic bacteria from the marine sources appear to have significant role in the detergent industries, ripening of the salted fish, fish sauces and marinades, modifying fish protein concentrations, dehairing and deskinning, non aqueous enzymology and asymmetric catalysis. in the present chapter, the proteases from the halophilic and haloalkaliphilic bacteria have been reviewed with respect to their occurrence and biochemical properties.
polymerase_chain_reaction	cytomegalovirus (cmv) is the most frequent cause of congenital infection worldwide, with an estimated incidence in developed countries of 0.6-0.7% of all live births. the burden of disease related to congenital cmv in substantial, as it is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss and an important cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities in children. despite its clinical significance, congenital cmv infection often goes undetected because the majority of infected infants are asymptomatic at birth and screening programs have not been substantially implemented. other than behavioral measures, effective interventions aimed at the prevention of maternal infection and of mother-to-child transmission are lacking. due to a convergence of recent advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in infants with congenital cmv, though, the field likely will be changing rapidly over just the next few years. specifically, a highly-sensitive screening test with high throughput potential has been developed, and treatment of infants symptomatically infected with congenital cmv has proven to be well-tolerated and effective in improving long-term hearing and neurodevelopmental outcomes. this review highlights the clinical importance of congenital cmv infection, the developments in laboratory diagnostics, and the benefits of antiviral therapy. it also identifies the global efforts still required in the prevention of maternal infection and in the optimization of antiviral therapy to further reduce the burden of congenital cmv disease.
genetics	purpose: to describe the genotypes distribution of orientia tsutsugamushi, in guangzhou, and explore differences in clinical and laboratory features among genotypes. method: we collected blood or eschar samples of all scrub typhus cases reported in 2013 from 10 district hospitals positive for pcr. we further tested the pcr-positive samples for dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. we collected the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data by questionnaire and medical records. result: a total of 589 samples were tested and 40 were pcr positive. four genotypes were identified: karp (52.2%), kato (22.5%), gilliam (12.5%), and ta763 (7.5%). two new strains (zcx90 and chx5 strain) were previously unidentified in guangzhou. gilliam type cases were more likely to have continuous fever (60.0%). only kato genotype cases presented with splenomegaly. for laboratory features, kato group had higher level of white blood cell count (16.44 x 10(12)/l) than normal range and other groups. total bilirubin and direct bilirubin in gilliam group (10.10 mu m and 3.05 mu m, respectively) were both lower than other groups and normal value. conclusion: continuous fever and splenomegaly may be the distinctive symptom of gilliam and kato genotype cases, respectively. karp genotype remained dominant in guangzhou, but attention should be paid to the emergence of new types or variation of existing genotypes.
strength_of_materials	lateral dynamic soil pile interaction is investigated through an improved tajimi type solution. the soil is treated as a continuum with hysteretic material damping as previously proposed by the authors, and the pile is modelled as beam using traditional strength-of-materials solutions. following the pioneering work of novak and nogami, a more accurate analytical model for the static and harmonic response of a pile in a soil layer overlying rock is proposed, and closed form expressions for pile head stiffness are derived. results are validated through comparisons against rigorous solutions from literature. hereafter, the winkler model was considered as a simple alternative for predicting pile head stiffness and damping. an extensive review of available winkler moduli demonstrated that the winkler model performance strongly depends on the selection of the respective moduli but found to be satisfactory in static conditions. most existing expressions for dynamic winkler moduli were found to render the model incapable of capturing resonant effects. consequently, a new expression for a dynamic winkler modulus is derived based on a modification of the classic dynamic plane strain modulus of baranov novak. implemented in the winkler model this expression is capable of accurately computing dynamic stiffness attenuation and damping increase for frequencies up to the first resonance over a wide range of pile slenderness ratios.
northern_blotting	rice stripe virus (rsv) often causes severe rice yield loss in temperate regions of east asia. although the correlation of small interfering rnas (sirnas) with transgenic virus resistance of plants using rna interference (rnai) is known for decades, no systematical research has been done on the profiling of sirnas from a genomic scale. our research is aiming to systematically study the rnai impact in rsv-resistant transgenic rice, which was generated by introducing an inverted repeat construct that targets rsv nucleocapsid protein (ncp) gene. in this paper, three independent rsv-resistant transgenic rice lines were generated, their stable integration of the t-dna fragment and the expression of sirnas were confirmed by southern blotting and northern blotting analyses, and the majority of sirnas were in lengths of 21, 22, and 24 nucleotides (nt), which have validated a connection between the presence of the rsv ncp homologous sirnas and the rsv resistance in those transgenic rice lines. in one of these transgenic lines (t4-b1), the t-dna fragment was found to have been inserted at chromosome 1 of the rice genome, substituting the rice genome fragment from 32 158 773 to 32 158 787 nt. bioinformatics analysis of small rna-seq data on the t4-b1 line also confirmed the large population of ncp-derived sirnas in transgenic plants, and the rsv-infected library (t4-b1-v) possessed more sirnas than its mock inoculated libraries (t4-b1-vf), these results indicating the inverted repeat construct and rsv could introduce abundance of sirnas in transgenic rice. moreover, a varied expression level of specific sirnas was found among different segments of the ncp gene template, about 47% of ncp-derived sirnas reads aligned with the fragment from 594 to 832 nt (239 nt in length) in ncp gene (969 nt in length) in the t4-b1-v, indicating a potential usage of hotspot regions for rnai silencing in future research. in conclusion, as the first study to address the sirna profile in rsv-resistant transgenic plant using next generation sequencing (ngs) technique, we confirmed that the massive abundance of sirna derived from the inverted repeat of ncp is the major reason for rsv-resistance.
manufacturing_engineering	mechanical manufacturing engineering is an important professional basic course and degree course for mechanical design, manufacturing and automation and has an important position on the outstanding engineers' training program. the problems existed in the present course teaching of mechanical manufacturing engineering were detailed analyzed and the paper explored constructing the teaching curriculum system and teaching contents for the teaching of outstanding engineers' training and reforming the old, outdated teaching methods and means. the reformation results show that the students' learning enthusiasm and initiative are improved and their engineering consciousness and innovation ability have greatly been improved.
cell_biology	a predictive framework for the evolution of stem cell biology in 3-d is currently lacking. in this study we propose deep image informatics of the nuclear biology of stem cells to elucidate how 3-d biomaterials steer stem cell lineage phenotypes. the approach is based on high content imaging informatics to capture minute variations in the 3-d spatial organization of splicing factor sc-35 in the nucleoplasm as a marker to classify emergent cell phenotypes of human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs). the cells were cultured in varied 3-d culture systems including hydrogels, electrospun mats and salt leached scaffolds. the approach encompasses high resolution 3-d imaging of sc-35 domains and high content image analysis (hcia) to compute quantitative 3-d nuclear metrics for sc-35 organization in single cells in concert with machine learning approaches to construct a predictive cell-state classification model. our findings indicate that hmscs cultured in collagen hydrogels and induced to differentiate into osteogenic or adipogenic lineages could be classified into the three lineages (stem, adipogenic, osteogenic) with >= 80% precision and sensitivity, within 72 h. using this framework, the augmentation of osteogenesis by scaffold design exerted by porogen leached scaffolds was also profiled within 72 h with similar to 80% high sensitivity. furthermore, by employing 3-d sc-35 organizational metrics, differential osteogenesis induced by novel electrospun fibrous polymer mats incorporating decellularized matrix could also be elucidated and predictably modeled at just 3 days with high precision. we demonstrate that 3-d sc-35 organizational metrics can be applied to model the stem cell state in 3-d scaffolds. we propose that this methodology can robustly discern minute changes in stem cell states within complex 3-d architectures and map single cell biological readouts that are critical to assessing population level cell heterogeneity. statement of significance the sustained development and validation of bioactive materials relies on technologies that can sensitively discern cell response dynamics to biomaterials, while capturing cell-to-cell heterogeneity and preserving cellular native phenotypes. in this study, we illustrate the application of a novel high content image informatics platform to classify emergent human mesenchymal stem cell (hmsc) phenotypes in a diverse range of 3-d biomaterial scaffolds with high sensitivity and precision, and track cell responses to varied external stimuli. a major in silico innovation is the proposed image profiling technology based on unique three dimensional textural signatures of a mechanoreporter protein within the nuclei of stem cells cultured in 3-d scaffolds. this technology will accelerate the pace of high-fidelity biomaterial screening.

human_metabolism	background: the human 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, comprising e1o, e2o, and e3 components, catalyzes conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-coa. results: human e1o generates both a thiamin-enamine-derived radical and the reactive oxygen species, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. conclusion: human e1o produces reactive oxygen species at a rate of <1% of succinyl-coa under physiological conditions. significance: this work presents the novel discovery that the 5-carboxyl group affects enzymatic reactivity of 2-oxoglutarate. herein are reported unique properties of the human 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (ogdhc), a rate-limiting enzyme in the krebs (citric acid) cycle. (a) functionally competent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (e1o-h) and dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase components have been expressed according to kinetic and spectroscopic evidence. (b) a stable free radical, consistent with the c2-(c2-hydroxy)--carboxypropylidene thiamin diphosphate (thdp) cation radical was detected by electron spin resonance upon reaction of the e1o-h with 2-oxoglutarate (og) by itself or when assembled from individual components into ogdhc. (c) an unusual stability of the e1o-h-bound c2-(2-hydroxy)--carboxypropylidene thiamin diphosphate (the thdp-enamine/c2-carbanion, the first postdecarboxylation intermediate) was observed, probably stabilized by the 5-carboxyl group of og, not reported before. (d) the reaction of og with the e1o-h gave rise to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide (reactive oxygen species (ros)). (e) the relatively stable enzyme-bound enamine is the likely substrate for oxidation by o-2, leading to the superoxide anion radical (in d) and the radical (in b). (f) the specific activity assessed for ros formation compared with the nadh (overall complex) activity, as well as the fraction of radical intermediate occupying active centers of e1o-h are consistent with each other and indicate that radical/ros formation is an off-pathway side reaction comprising less than 1% of the on-pathway reactivity. however, the nearly ubiquitous presence of ogdhc in human tissues, including the brain, makes these findings of considerable importance in human metabolism and perhaps disease.
thermodynamics	equilibrium thermodynamic modelling, quartz in garnet (quig) raman geobarometry, and modelling of garnet nucleation at overstepped conditions were applied to three garnet-bearing blueschists from a 1.5km-long transect across the eclogite-blueschist unit in sifnos, greece, in order to evaluate the accuracy of pt conditions calculated via equilibrium thermodynamics. quig barometry uses the raman shift of quartz inclusions in garnet to estimate the pressure of garnet nucleation and is independent of chemical equilibrium. garnet nucleation temperatures were estimated by determining the stability field of the palaeo-assemblage inferred from garnet inclusion suites on mineral assemblage diagrams calculated in the mnnckfmash system and on temperatures obtained from zr in rutile thermometry. these conditions were then compared to pt conditions calculated at the equilibrium garnet isograd, and the method of intersecting isopleths. the pt conditions calculated with intersecting garnet isopleths over- and underestimated the temperature of nucleation in samples sph99-1a and sph99-7, respectively, whereas they significantly underestimated nucleation pressure in sph99-5. nucleation of garnet in sph99-1a at 12 kbar and similar to 484 degrees c requires overstepping of similar to 6 kbar and a reaction affinity of 2.2kj mol(1) o. sph99-5 requires overstepping of similar to 8 kbar with garnet reaction affinities of at least 2.0kj mol(1) o at 15 kbar and similar to 520 degrees c. sph99-7 requires overstepping of approximately 15 kbar and affinities of about 2.0-2.4kj mol(1) o at similar to 23 kbar and similar to 530 degrees c. the geotherms calculated from sph99-7 (similar to 6.7 degrees c km(1)) and sph99-5 (9.8 degrees c km(1)) are in accordance with previous studies. the geotherm calculated from sph99-1a, however, is warmer (11.3 degrees c km(1)), and could reflect changes in the rate of subduction or differences in structural position within the down-going slab. the 10 kbar pressure difference between sph99-7 and sph99-1a can be explained by thrusting and accretion of thin slices of underplated wedge material facilitated by slab rollback and gravitational collapse.
genetics	background: newcastle disease (nd) and avian influenza subtype h9n2 (h9n2 ai) are two of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses in the global poultry industry. vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control the spread of nd virus (ndv) and h9n2 ai virus (aiv), but the antigenic differences between the current circulating strains and the vaccine strains might account for recent nd and h9n2 ai outbreaks in vaccinated poultry flocks. methods: we developed an inactivated bivalent h9n2 and ndv vaccine based on the current prevalent strains of h9n2 aiv and ndv in china and evaluated its efficacy in chickens in this study. results: the results indicated that the inactivated bivalent vaccine could induce a fast antibody response in vaccinated chickens. the hemagglutination inhibition (hi) titer in the sera increased rapidly, and the highest hi titer was observed at 4 weeks post-vaccination (wpv) with a mean titre of 8.6 log(2) for ndv and 9.5 log(2) for h9n2. up until 15 wpv, hi titers were still detectable at a high level of over 6 log(2). the immunized chickens showed no signs of disease after challenge at 3 wpv with the prevalent strains of ndv and h9n2 aiv isolated in 2012-2014. moreover, viral shedding was completely inhibited in vaccinated chickens after challenge with h9n2 aiv and inhibited by at least 90% with ndv compared to the controls at 5dpc. conclusions: our findings suggest that the inactivated ndv and h9n2 vaccine induces a fast and strong antibody response in vaccinated chickens and is efficacious in poultry against ndvs and h9n2 aivs.
internal_combustion_engine	different cooling structures for cylinder head and block and the corresponding thermal status, thermal dissipation and frictional power dissipation were investigated in this study. in a conventional engine cooling configuration, the coolant flow travels from the block to the head, leading to the coolant temperature of the head being higher than that of block. furthermore, the over-cooling problem in the block will occur because the cooling system is designed for the cooling requirements of the cylinder head without considering the cooling load of the block. this paper developed a 3d single cylinder model to analyse the influence of coolant flow direction and split structure cooling for the head and block. the analysis indicated that the top-bottom flow cooling structure can effectively reduce the cylinder head thermal load and slightly increase the temperature of the cylinder liner. the combined split and top-bottom cooling structure is proven as the optimal solution with the advantages of lower thermal and frictional power dissipation compared with that of the conventional cooling structure.

thermodynamics	in the context of the ever harsher production conditions encountered in the oil and gas industry, there is a need for improved materials qualification methods for sour (h2s) environments. the classic approach, based on h2s partial pressure, does not adequately characterize the corrosive severity of, in particular, high-pressure environments such as high-pressure high-temperature wells. this paper describes the introduction of non-ideal thermodynamics in the characterization of environmental severity. the focus is on sour exposure and using h2s fugacity or h2s aqueous concentration rather than h2s partial pressure. experimental work has shown that these approaches are valid, at least for sulfide stress corrosion cracking of steel, and some of the benefits are demonstrated. it is recommended to extend this work to other materials and degradation mechanisms and also to upgrade laboratory test methods and industry standards for this purpose.
human_metabolism	a novel hypothesis-free multivariate screening methodology for the study of human exercise metabolism in blood serum is presented. serum gas chromatography/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( gc/tofms) data was processed using hierarchical multivariate curve resolution ( h-mcr), and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis ( opls-da) was used to model the systematic variation related to the acute effect of strenuous exercise. potential metabolic biomarkers were identified using data base comparisons. extensive validation was carried out including predictive h-mcr, 7-fold full cross-validation, and predictions for the opls-da model, variable permutation for highlighting interesting metabolites, and pairwise t tests for examining the significance of metabolites. the concentration changes of potential biomarkers were verified in the raw gc/tofms data. in total, 420 potential metabolites were resolved in the serum samples. on the basis of the relative concentrations of the 420 resolved metabolites, a valid multivariate model for the difference between pre- and postexercise subjects was obtained. a total of 34 metabolites were highlighted as potential biomarkers, all statistically significant ( p< 8.1e-05). as an example, two potential markers were identified as glycerol and asparagine. the concentration changes for these two metabolites were also verified in the raw gc/tofms data. the strategy was shown to facilitate interpretation and validation of metabolic interactions in human serum as well as revealing the identity of potential markers for known or novel mechanisms of human exercise physiology. the multivariate way of addressing metabolism studies can help to increase the understanding of the integrative biology behind, as well as unravel new mechanistic explanations in relation to, exercise physiology.
molecular_biology	the use of the ligninolytic fungi trametes versicolor for the degradation of micropollutants has been widely studied. however, few studies have addressed the treatment of real wastewater containing pharmaceutically active compounds (phac) under non-sterile conditions. the main drawback of performing such treatments is the difficulty for the inoculated fungus to successfully compete with the other microorganisms growing in the bioreactor. id the present study, several fungal treatments were performed under non-sterile conditions in continuous operational mode with two types of real wastewater effluent, namely, a reverse osmosis concentrate (roc) from a wastewater treatment plant and a veterinary hospital wastewater (vhw). in all cases, the setup consisted of two parallel reactors: one inoculated with t. versicolor and one non-inoculated, which was used as the control. the main objective of this work was to correlate the operational conditions and traditional monitoring parameters, such as laccase activity, with phac removal and the composition of the microbial communities developed inside the bioreactors. for that purpose a variety of biochemical and molecular biology analyses were performed: phospholipid fatty acids analysis (plfa), quantitative pcr (qpcr) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) followed by sequencing. the results show that many indigenous fungi (and not only bacteria, which were the focus of the majority of previously published research) can successfully compete with the inoculated fungi (i.e., trichoderma asperellum overtook t. versicolor in the roc treatment). we also showed that the wastewater origin and the operational conditions had a stronger impact on the diversity of microbial communities developed in the bioreactors than the inoculation or not with t. versicolor.

machine_design	purpose - inverting electroheat problems involves synthesizing the electromagnetic arrangement of coils and geometries to realize a desired heat distribution. to this end two finite element problems need to be solved, first for the magnetic fields and the joule heat that the associated eddy currents generate and then, based on these heat sources, the second problem for heat distribution. this two-part problem needs to be iterated on to obtain the desired thermal distribution by optimization. being a time consuming process, the purpose of this paper is to parallelize the process using the graphics processing unit (gpu) and the real-coded genetic algorithm, each for both speed and accuracy. design/methodology/approach - this coupled problem represents a heavy computational load with long wait-times for results. the gpu has recently been demonstrated to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the finite element computations and cut down solution times. it has also been used to speedup the naturally parallel genetic algorithm. the authors use the gpu to perform coupled electroheat finite element optimization by the genetic algorithm to achieve computational efficiencies far better than those reported for a single finite element problem. in the genetic algorithm, coding objective functions in real numbers rather than binary arithmetic gives added speed and accuracy. findings - the feasibility of the method proposed to reduce computational time and increase accuracy is established through the simple problem of shaping a current carrying conductor so as to yield a constant temperature along a line. the authors obtained a speedup (cpu time to gpu time ratio) saturating to about 28 at a population size of 500 because of increasing communications between threads. but this far better than what is possible on a workstation. research limitations/implications - by using the intrinsically parallel genetic algorithm on a gpu, large complex coupled problems may be solved very quickly. the method demonstrated here without accounting for radiation and convection, may be trivially extended to more completely modeled electroheat systems. since the primary purpose here is to establish methodology and feasibility, the thermal problem is simplified by neglecting convection and radiation. while that introduces some error, the computational procedure is still validated. practical implications - the methodology established has direct applications in electrical machine design, metallurgical mixing processes, and hyperthermia treatment in oncology. in these three practical application areas, the authors need to compute the exciting coil (or antenna) arrangement (current magnitude and phase) and device geometry that would accomplish a desired heat distribution to achieve mixing, reduce machine heat or burn cancerous tissue. this process presented does it more accurately and speedily. social implications - particularly the above-mentioned application in oncology will alleviate human suffering through use in hyperthermia treatment planning in cancer treatment. the method presented provides scope for new commercial software development and employment. originality/value - previous finite element shape optimization of coupled electroheat problems by this group used gradient methods whose difficulties are explained. others have used analytical and circuit models in place of finite elements. this paper applies the massive parallelization possible with gpus to the inherently parallel genetic algorithm, and extends it from single field system problems to coupled problems, and thereby realizes practicable solution times for such a computationally complex problem. further, by using gpu computations rather than cpu, accuracy is enhanced. and then by using real number rather than binary coding for object functions, further accuracy and speed gains are realized.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: potassium channels of the atp-sensitive family (k-atp channel) are inhibited by increase in intracellular atp. electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that the kinetics and pharmacological properties of kat? channels vary among different tissues, suggesting structurally and functionally distinct types. there are studies showing human periodontal ligament (pdl) cells respond to mechanical stress by increasing atp release, which participates in bone resorption or bone homeostasis. so, in this study we investigated the existence of kat? channel subunit and their single channel properties in human periodontal ligaments. materials & method: the human pdl cells were isolated from healthy erupted third molar. for patch clamp experiments, human pdl fibroblasts were seeded on 3.5 cm plastic dishes. the inside-out patch clamp recordings were performed under voltage clamp mode. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was conducted to identify the channel subunits. all pair-wise comparisons were performed by paired t-test. a p value < 0.05 was considered significant. results: we observed mrna transcripts for kir6.1, kir6.2 and sur2b subuits in the human pdl cells. in inside-out patch mode, the single channel conductance was 163 ps at symmetrical k+ concentration of 140 mm and inward rectification was seen in atp-free bath solution. the reversal potential of the currents was found to be 0 mv at symmetrical concentration (140 mm) of k+ in bath solution. the single channel currents were almost blocked by adding 5 mm atp in the bath solution. however, the currents were not blocked by 100 mu m glibenclamide, a subunit specific k-atp channel blocker. conclusions: these results indicate that human pdl cells express k-atp channels subunit including sur2b and kir6.1 and kir6.2 which are sensitive to atp but insensitive to glibenclamide.

human_metabolism	since humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor over 6 million years ago, human metabolism has changed dramatically. this change includes adaptations to a high-quality diet, the evolution of an energetically expensive brain, dramatic increases in endurance abilities, and capacity for energy storage in white adipose tissue. human metabolism continues to evolve in modern human populations in response to local environmental and cultural selective forces. understanding the nature of these selective forces and the physiological responses during human evolution is a compelling challenge for evolutionary biologists. the complex genetic architecture surrounding metabolic phenotypes indicates that selection probably altered allelic frequencies across many loci in populations experiencing adaptive metabolic change to fit their environment. a recent analysis supports this hypothesis, finding that classic selective sweeps at single loci were rare during the past 250 000 years of human evolution. detection of selective signatures at multiple loci, as well as exploration of physiological adaptation to environment in humans, will require cross-disciplinary collaboration, including the incorporation of biological pathway analysis. this review explores the thrifty genotype hypothesis, high-altitude adaptation, cold-resistance adaptation, and genetic evidence surrounding these proposed metabolic adaptations in an attempt to clarify current challenges and avenues for future progress.
human_metabolism	high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy is a very powerful tool for the structural identification of xenobiotic metabolites ill complex biological matrices such as plasma, urine and bile. however, these fluids are dominated by thousands of signals resulting from endogenous metabolites and it is advantageous when investigating drug metabolites in such matrices to simplify the spectra by including a separation step in the experiment by directly-coupling hplc and nmr. naproxen (6-methoxy-alpha -methyl-2-naphthyl acetic acid) is administered as the s-enantiomer and is metabolised in vivo to form its demethylated metabolite which is subsequently conjugated with beta -d-glucuronic acid as well as with sulfate. naproxen is also metabolised by phase ii metabolism directly to form a glycine conjugate as well as a glucuronic acid conjugate at the carboxyl group. in the present investigation, the metabolism of naproxen was investigated in urine samples with a very simple sample preparation using a combination of directly-coupled hplc-h-1 nmr spectroscopy and hplc-mass spectrometry (ms). a buffer system was developed which allows the same chromatographic method to be used for the hplc-nmr as well as the hplc-ms analysis. the combination of these methods is complementary in information content since the nmr spectra provide evidence to distinguish isomers such as the type of glucuronides formed, and the hplc-ms data allow identification of molecules containing nmr-silent fragments such as occur in the sulfate ester.

molecular_biology	twin-arginine translocation (tat) pathways have been well-characterized in bacteria and chloroplasts. genes encoding a tatc protein are found in almost all plant mitochondrial genomes but to date these have not been extensively investigated. for the first time it could be demonstrated that this mitochondrial-encoded tatc is a functional gene that is translated into a protein in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. a tatb-like subunit localized to the inner membrane was also identified that is nuclear-encoded and is essential for plant growth and development, indicating that plants potentially require a tat pathway for mitochondrial biogenesis.
fluid_mechanics	in the computation of fluid mechanics problems with moving boundaries, including fluid-structure interaction, fluid mesh deformation is a common problem to be solved. an automatic mesh deformation technique for large deformations of the fluid mesh is presented on the basis of a pseudo-solid method in which the fluid mesh motion is governed by the equations of elasticity. a two-dimensional mathematical model of a linear elastic body is built by using the finite element method. the numerical result shows that the proposed method has a better performance in moving the fluid mesh without producing distorted elements than that of the classic one-step methods.
manufacturing_engineering	the automotive industry is facing a tremendous growth in the engineering of software-intensive systems, giving rise to various challenges. to prevent problems related to the fit of new software technologies in vehicles and the manufacturing processes, a well functioning interaction between the functions for product development and manufacturing is crucial. this is complicated by the fact that the changeable nature of software development causes unprecedented needs for collaboration and coordination between these two functions. this paper reports on a process assessment that focuses on the interface between the functions for product development and manufacturing in the development and design of software-intensive automotive systems. the main purpose of the study was to identify the key issues for improvement in the area assessed. the assessment was performed at two swedish automotive companies where data were collected from documents and in interviews with practitioners. nine key improvement issues were established ranging from challenges in requirements engineering to the need for knowledge transfer between manufacturing and product development. in addition, to increase the understandability of the results and map possible avenues for solution and future research, the paper provides an extensive analysis of each improvement issue in relation to the state-of-the-art.
genetics	this special feature results from the symposium 'ants 2016: ant interactions with their biotic environments' held in munich in may 2016 and deals with the interactions between ants and other insects, plants, microbes and fungi, studied at micro- and macroevolutionary levels with a wide range of approaches, from field ecology to next-generation sequencing, chemical ecology and molecular genetics. in this paper, we review key aspects of these biotic interactions to provide background information for the papers of this special feature. after listing the major types of biotic interactions that ants engage in, we present a brief overview of ant/ant communication, ant/plant interactions, ant/fungus symbioses, and recent insights about ants and their endosymbionts. using a large molecular clock-dated formicidae phylogeny, we map the evolutionary origins of different ant clades' interactions with plants, fungi and hemiptera. ants' biotic interactions provide ideal systems to address fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions about mutualism, coevolution, adaptation and animal communication.
machine_design	the objective of this study is to find the optimal combination of factors used in the process of wastewater treatment to collect the suspended rubber content from the disc cleaning process. the factors include the amount of grass2 and the waiting time required for the rubber to coagulate. the study was conducted using two sets of experiments. one is to find the deterministic optimal amount of grass2 and waiting time, and the other one is to find whether it is practical to use the fiber optic sensor as a tool to indicate the sufficient amount of grass2 required. the results from the experiments show that using the fiber optic sensor requires a greater amount of grass2 than the deterministic method since the objective function of the sensor model was to maximize light intensity in the wastewater, while the objective function of the deterministic model was to maximize the percentage of the achieved rubber contents.
hydraulics	several studies suggest that invertebrate abundance and richness are disrupted and reset at confluences. thus, junctions contribute disproportionately to the overall aquatic biodiversity of the river. in general terms, authors have reported high abundance and diversity due to the major physical heterogeneity at junctions. however, data are still scarce and uncertainties are plentiful. the impact of a great input of fine sediments on the distribution patterns of benthic invertebrates at a river confluence was quantitatively analyzed herein. the junction of the subtropical bermejo river (high suspended sediment load) with the large paraguay river is the selected study area to achieve this aim. while diversity increased slightly downstream the junction (from 0.21 to 0.36), density and richness of the macroinvertebrate assemblage significantly diminished downstream the confluence (from 29050 to 410 ind/m(2); p<0.05) due to the input of fine sediment from the bermejo river (mean fine sediment increased downstream from 6.3 to 10.2 mg/l), causing a negatively impact on invertebrate assemblage. this study highlights the ecological importance of the sediment input effects on benthic invertebrates, a topic still poorly explored in river ecology. it is speculated that the spatial extent of the impact would be dependent upon the hydrological and sedimentological context, highly unequal between both rivers. new hypotheses should be tested through new studies considering different hydrological stages.
genetics	background: differences in genetics and receptor expression (phenotypes) of invasive ductal breast cancer (idc) impact on prognosis and treatment response. immunohistochemistry (ihc), the most used technique for idc phenotyping, has some limitations including its invasiveness. we explored the possibility of contrast-enhanced positron emission tomography magnetic resonance (ce-fdg pet/mr) to discriminate idc phenotypes. methods: 21 idc patients with ihc assessment of oestrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr), human epidermal growth factor-2 (her2), and antigen ki-67 (ki67) underwent ce-fdg pet/mr. magnetic resonance-perfusion biomarkers, apparent diffusion coefficient (adc), and standard uptake value (suv) were compared with ihc markers and phenotypes, using a student 's t-test and one-way anova. results: er/pr - tumours demonstrated higher kep(mean) and suvmax than er or pr+ tumours. her2 - tumours displayed higher adc(mean), kep(mean), and suvmax than her2+tumours. only adc(mean) discriminated ki6714% tumours. pet/mr biomarkers correlated with ihc phenotype in 13 out of 21 patients (62%; p = 0.001). conclusions: positron emission tomography magnetic resonance might non-invasively help discriminate idc phenotypes, helping to optimise individual therapy options.
northern_blotting	carcinogenesis is driven by an accumulation of mutations and genetic lesions, which leads to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. however, the molecular mechanisms by which the expression of these genes was regulated in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. in this study, we investigated the regulatory effects of microrna and methylation on the expression of k-ras, tp53 and pten genes in pancreatic cancer cells. the protein and mirna levels were measured by western blotting and northern blotting, respectively. xenograft pancreatic tumor models were established by inoculating bxpc-1, capan-2, and panc-1 tumor cells into athymic nu/nu mice. a disparate level of kras, p53, pten, dnmts, and dicer 1 proteins as well as let-7i, mir-22, mir-143, and mir-29b mirna was observed in bxpc-1, capan-2, and panc-1 cells. knockdown of dicer 1 expression in bxpc-3 and panc-1 cells resulted in significant increases in kras, p53, pten, and dnmts protein levels and significant decreases in mir-22, mir-143, let-7i, and mir-29b expression. knockdown of dicer 1 expression in capan-2 cells significantly increased p53 and pten expression, while significantly decreased mir-22 and mir-143 expression, but had no effects on pten. dnmts, let-7i, and mir-29b expression. knockdown of dicer 1 expression significantly inhibited xenograft bxpc-3 tumor growth, but promoted xenograft panc-1 tumor growth. in contrast, knockdown of dicer 1 expression had no effect on xenograft capan-2 tumor growth. our study suggested that different pancreatic cancer cell lines exhibited obvious discrepancies in gene expression profiles, implying that different molecular mechanisms are involved in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer subclasses. our study highlighted the importance of personalized therapy.

materials_engineering	path length measuring is a relevant engineering problem. leonardo da vinci designed for the military appropriate equipment, the podometer, to do so. modern equipment such as step meters and map meters are quite similar to da vinci 's design, despite geometrical statistical - stereological - methods based on theorems of cauchy and buffon that were potentially available for a long period of time for doing a better job. the theorems have moreover been applied earlier for the engineering purposes indicated in this paper. even saltikov 's reintroduction for quantitative image analysis purposes in 1945 was ignored. gradually, the last half of a century, stereological methods became more popular in concrete technology. nevertheless, the stereology-based global averaging operation required to make the step from materials technology to engineering properties is inherent to making errors, as the literature demonstrates. the methodological framework has been described in earlier papers by this author as to path length measurements in sections of cracked concrete and on x-ray images of steel fibre reinforced concrete (sfrc). by laying side by side in this paper the direct engineering approach (from da vinci to map meter) and the science (stereology)-based approaches, the profit in economy and reliability can nevertheless be stressed. particularly the element of geometric averaging based on simple mathematical-statistical notions is highlighted, because the literature reflects still major violations to these scientific principles. three-dimensional information in the indicated fields of materials engineering is also readily obtained, provided proper sampling is guaranteed.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the melanocortin 1 receptor (mcir) gene is a candidate functional gene that controls the pigment production in melanocytes. the aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms and investigate the effect of the mcir gene on plumage coloration in duck breeds, including korean native ducks. initially, 34 individuals from seven duck breeds were sequenced, obtaining 12 polymorphisms. five single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the coding region were non-synonymous, with mutations corresponding to amino acid changes. among these, four snps were geno-typed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 264 individuals from same seven duck breeds. fisher 's exact test was conducted to identify possible relationships between the mcir gene polymorphisms and plumage color variations. four non-synonymous snps, c.52a>g (p.lys18glu), and c.376 a>g (p.ile126val), c.409g>a (p.ala137thr) and c.649c>t (p.arg217cys), were associated with the two deduced genotypes (i.e., e/e and e+ /e+) based on plumage color phenotypes. in addition, we reconstructed mcir gene haplotypes, where the haplotype aagc showed its highest frequency in nageswari duck breed, which presents an extended black phenotype. our results indicate that the identified polymorphisms by this study can be used to explore associations with plumage color variations in asian duck breeds.
internal_combustion_engine	toluene is frequently used as laser-induced fluorescence (lif) tracer for visualizing mixing processes, for example, in internal combustion engines. the signal evaluation relies on a linear dependence of the lif signal on tracer concentration - which is not present in many practically relevant cases. this paper presents an investigation of the dependence of the lif signal intensities on the toluene concentration, revealing a non-linear signal response already at concentrations approximately ten times below those given by the room-temperature vapor pressure. toluene was vaporized in a mass-flow controlled evaporator and investigated in a free jet. nitrogen was used as bath gas with a variable addition of oxygen. after excitation at 266 nm, an intensified ccd camera recorded the spectrally filtered fluorescence. in separate experiments, the effective fluorescence lifetime upon picosecond uv-laser excitation was determined. the results indicate that the fluorescence lifetime decreases with increasing tracer concentration due to self-quenching. results from imaging and fluorescence lifetime measurements are consistent. the investigation reveals that the self-quenching of toluene is dominated by collisions with excited-state toluene molecules, which causes an additional dependence of the magnitude of self-quenching on the laser fluence.

thermodynamics	in this computational study, the thermodynamics of h-2, proton, and hydride transfer from 13 ammonium borohydride and six phosphonium borohydride intramolecular and intermolecular frustrated lewis pairs (flps) was probed to gain insight into whether intramolecular or intermolecular amine-containing flps are preferred to phosphine-containing flps in flp-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions. h-2, hydride, and proton transfer from intramolecular ammonium borohydrides was, on average, 2.6 kcal/mol, 0.7 kcal/mol, and about 3.8 pk(a) units, respectively, less likely than from intramolecular phosphonium borohydrides. using the thermodynamic quantities for h-2, hydride, and proton transfer to eight probe substrates, intramolecular phosphonium borohydrides were found to be thermodynamically preferred to intramolecular ammonium borohydrides in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.
southern_blotting	background: struma ovarii (so) is a rare form of ovarian mature teratoma in which thyroid tissue is the predominant element. because of its rarity, the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant so has not been clearly defined. it is believed that malignant transformation of so has similar molecular features with and its prognosis corresponds to that of malignant tumors originating in the thyroid. case presentation: we report 35-year-old woman with bilateral ovarian cysts incidentally detected by ultrasound during the first trimester of pregnancy. four months after delivery of a healthy child without complication she was admitted to the hospital for acute abdominal pain. laparoscopic left adnexectomy was performed initially in a regional hospital; right cystectomy was done later in a specialized clinic. intraoperative frozen section and a final pathology revealed that the cyst from the left ovary was composed of mature teratomatous elements, normal thyroid tissue (>50%) and a non-encapsulated focus of follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc). normal and cancerous thyroid tissues were tested for braf and ras mutations by direct sequencing, and for ret/ptc rearrangements by rt-pcr/southern blotting. a kras codon 12 mutation, the ggt ->gtt transversion, corresponding to the gly ->val amino acid change was identified in the absence of other genetic alterations commonly found in ptc. conclusion: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this mutation is described in a papillary thyroid carcinoma arising in struma in the ovarii. this finding provides further evidence that even rare mutations specific for ptc may occur in such tumors. molecular testing may be a useful adjunct to common differential diagnostic methods of thyroid malignancy in so.
immunology	advances in clinical immunology in the past year included the report of practice parameters for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiencies to guide the clinician in the approach to these relatively uncommon disorders. we have learned of new gene defects causing immunodeficiency and of new phenotypes expanding the spectrum of conditions caused by genetic mutations such as a specific regulator of telomere elongation (rtel1) mutation causing isolated natural killer cell deficiency and mutations in ras-associated rab (rab27) resulting in immunodeficiency without albinism. advances in diagnosis included the increasing use of whole-exome sequencing to identify gene defects and the measurement of serum free light chains to identify secondary hypogammaglobulinemias. for several primary immunodeficiencies, improved outcomes have been reported after definitive therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy.
northern_blotting	principles: b-domain deleted human coagulation factor viii cdna (bdd-hfviiicdna) transgenic mice were produced by using sperm mediated gene transfer (smgt). the transcription and expression of human fviii in transgenic mice were also investigated. methods: sperm were isolated from caudae epididymides of male c57bl/6 mice and transfected with linearized rc/rsv-bdd-bfviiicdna plasmid, and subsequently used to fertilize female mice via artificial insemination in vivo. after birth, f0 progeny were identified by pcr and southern blotting for bdd-hfviiicdna transgenic mice. f1 progeny were subsequently derived from a male transgenic f0 mouse and a normal c57bl/6 female mouse. the f1 progeny were then identified as bdd-hfviiicdna transgenic mice by southern blotting. the transcription and expression of bddhfviiicdna in transgenic mice were determined by northern blotting, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. blood was also collected from both f0 and f1 progeny to detect hfvtit:ag and anti-hfviii inhibitors. results: a total of 9 f0 and 8 f1 progeny were delivered, in which 3 f0 and 2 f1 progeny were identified to have bdd-hfviiicdna. the transcription and expression of bdd-hfviiicdna were found to exist in the liver and kidneys of all transgenic mice. hfviii:ag in plasma of the transgenic f0 progeny was 31.95 ng/ml, 23.52 ng/ml and 26.36 ng/ml respectively, whilst the f1 transgenic mice showed results of 18.82 ng/ml and 12.16 ng/ml. anti-hfviii inhibitors were negative in both f0 and f1 progeny. conclusions: human fviii gene transgenic mice can be produced by the smgt technique and express human fviii protein in their bodies.
human_metabolism	previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial species are capable of transforming complex chemical substances. several of these species, native to the human gastrointestinal tract, are active in postmortem decomposition. they have potential to cause biotransformations affecting compound-to-metabolite ratios within the human body, especially after death. investigation of postmortem effects could supply valuable information, especially concerning compound identification and confirmation. the purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens on diazepam and flunitrazepam in reinforced clostridial medium, and to compare bacterial biotransformation products to those of human metabolism. a decrease in diazepam concentration between pre- and post-incubation was observed for samples inoculated with escherichia coli (14.7-20.2%) as well as bacteroides fragilis (13.9-25.7%); however there was no corresponding increase in concentration for the monitored human metabolites. flunitrazepam demonstrated a greater concentration loss when incubated with individual bacterial species as well as mixed culture (79.2-100.0%). samples incubated with bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and mixed culture resulted in nearly complete conversion of flunitrazepam. increased 7-aminoflunitrazepam concentrations accounted for the majority of the conversion; however discrepancies in the mass balance of the reaction suggested the possibility of a minor metabolite that was not monitored in the current analysis. these experiments served as a pilot study and proof of concept that can be adapted and applied to a realm of possibilities. ultimately, this methodology would be ideal to study compounds that are too toxic or lethal for animal and human metabolic investigations. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
cell_biology	an important aim of bone regenerative medicine is to design biomaterials with controlled chemical and topographical features to guide stem cell fate towards osteoblasts without addition of specific osteogenic factors. herein, we find that sprayed bioactive and biocompatible calcium phosphate substrates (cap) with controlled topography induce, in a well-orchestrated manner, wharton 's jelly stem cells (wj-scs) differentiation into osteoblastic lineage without any osteogenic supplements. the resulting wj-scs commitment exhibits features of native bone, through the formation of three-dimensional bone-like nodule with osteocyte-like cells embedded into a mineralized type i collagen. to our knowledge, these results present the first observation of a whole differentiation process from stem cell to osteocyteslike on a synthetic material. this suggests a great potential of sprayed cap and wj-scs in bone tissue engineering. these unique features may facilitate the transition from bench to bedside and the development of successful engineered bone. statement of significance designing materials to direct stem cell fate has a relevant impact on stem cell biology and provides insights facilitating their clinical application in regenerative medicine. inspired by natural bone compositions, a friendly automated spray-assisted system was used to build calcium phosphate substrate (cap). sprayed biomimetic solutions using mild conditions led to the formation of cap with controlled physical properties, good bioactivity and biocompatibility. herein, we show that via optimization of physical properties, cap substrate induce osteogenic differentiation of wharton 's jelly stem cells (wj-scs) without adding osteogenic supplement factors. these results suggest a great potential of sprayed cap and wj-scs in bone tissue engineering and may facilitate the transition from bench to beside and the development of clinically successful engineered bone.

strength_of_materials	several samples of residual base course material were studied to investigate the effects of compaction on their physical and mechanical properties. test results of compaction and cbr obtained for borrow pit material are compared with repeatedly used soil samples from the road. from analysis of changes of strength of materials before, during and after construction, and also site observations, it is recommended to establish not only the minimum requirements for compaction density, but also the maximum density. some guidelines are discussed for control of the level of compaction at the site.
genetics	background bipolar affective disorder (bpd) is a severe mood disorder with a prevalence of similar to 1.5% in the population. the pathogenesis of bpd is poorly understood; however, a strong heritable component has been identified. previous genome-wide association studies have indicated a region on 6q25, coding for the syne1 gene, which increases disease susceptibility. syne1 encodes the synaptic nuclear envelope protein-1, nesprin-1. a brain-specific splice variant of syne1, cpg2 encoding candidate plasticity gene 2, has been identified. the intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism with the strongest genome-wide significant association in bpd, rs9371601, is present in both syne1 and cpg2. methods we screened 937 bpd samples for genetic variation in syne1 exons 14-33, which covers the cpg2 region, using high-resolution melt analysis. in addition, we screened two regions of increased transcriptional activity, one of them proposed to be the cpg2 promoter region. results and conclusion we identified six nonsynonymous and six synonymous variants. we genotyped three rare nonsynonymous variants, rs374866393, rs148346599 and rs200629713, in a total of 1099 bpd samples and 1056 controls. burden analysis of these rare variants did not show a significant association with bpd. however, nine patients are compound heterozygotes for variants in syne1/cpg2, suggesting that rare coding variants may contribute significantly towards the complex genetic architecture underlying bpd. imputation analysis in our own whole-genome sequencing sample of 99 bpd individuals identified an additional eight risk variants in the cpg2 region of syne1. copyright (c) 2017 the author(s). published by wolters kluwer health, inc.
polymerase_chain_reaction	cryptosporidium and giardia are important causes of diarrhoeal illness. adequate knowledge of the molecular diversity and geographical distribution of these parasites and the environmental and climatic variables that influence their prevalence is important for effective control of infection in at-risk populations, yet relatively little is known about the epidemiology of these parasites in africa. cryptosporidium is associated with moderate to severe diarrhoea and increased mortality in african countries and both parasites negatively affect child growth and development. malnutrition and hiv status are also important contributors to the prevalence of cryptosporidium and giardia in african countries. molecular typing of both parasites in humans, domestic animals and wildlife to date indicates a complex picture of both anthroponotic, zoonotic and spill-back transmission cycles that requires further investigation. for cryptosporidium, the only available drug (nitazoxanide) is ineffective in hiv and malnourished individuals and therefore more effective drugs are a high priority. several classes of drugs with good efficacy exist for giardia, but dosing regimens are suboptimal and emerging resistance threatens clinical utility. climate change and population growth are also predicted to increase both malnutrition and the prevalence of these parasites in water sources. dedicated and co-ordinated commitments from african governments involving ""one health"" initiatives with multidisciplinary teams of veterinarians, medical workers, relevant government authorities, and public health specialists working together are essential to control and prevent the burden of disease caused by these parasites.
molecular_biology	the sialidase gene from brevibacterium casei was cloned in pet28a and overexpressed as a histidine-tagged protein in escherichia coli bl21(de3). the histidine-tagged sialidase protein was purified and characterized from the crude cell extracts of isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells using ni-nta agarose chromatography. sds-page using the purified sialidase indicated a single band at 116 kda. this sialidase showed maximum activity at a ph of 5.5 and temperature of 37 degrees c. the kinetic parameters k-m and v-max for the artificial substrate 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetyl-neuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate were 1.69 x 10(-3) mm and 244 mmol.min(-1)center dot mg(-1), respectively. the sialidase may catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids linked by the alpha-(2,3) and alpha-(2,8) linkage of polysialogangliosides, but it does not act on monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (gm1), which offers it a great potential for commercially producing gm1 from polysialogangliosides.
