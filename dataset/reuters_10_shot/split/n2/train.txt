label 8	GERMAN INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT SEEN STAGNATING The number of workers employed in the West German industrial sector stagnated in the last quarter of 1986 as a 50,000 increase in overall employment benefited only the services branch, the DIW economic institute said. A DIW report added the general downturn in the economy since last Autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness of firms to take on workers. It referred to a marked downturn in the number of workers taken on in the capital goods sector. New orders for manufacturing industry goods have mostly fallen or stagnated in recent months, but data for February finally showed a reversal of the trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.  
label 8	SWEDISH UNEMPLOYMENT STEADY IN MARCH Swedish unemployment was steady at 2.2 pct of the workforce in March compared with the previous month, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. In March 1986, the figure stood at 2.4 pct.  
label 8	DUTCH ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600 at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March 1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show. The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to 436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier and 259,400 at end-March 1986. On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was 725,000. A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year, because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the building industry. He said this explained the increase in the adjusted statistics. Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.  
label 8	AUSTRALIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH Australia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 8.4 pct of the estimated workforce in March from 8.2 pct in February and 7.9 pct a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said. The number of jobless rose to 650,700 from 631,900 in February and 593,200 a year earlier, the Bureau said. Unadjusted, the number of unemployed rose to 702,600 from 699,600 in February but the rate eased to 9.0 pct from 9.1, reflecting a slight increase in the estimated workforce. In March 1986, 640,400 persons, or 8.5 pct of the workforce, were out of work.  
label 8	U.S. FIRST TIME JOBLESS CLAIMS FELL IN WEEK New applications for unemployment insurance benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 338,000 in the week ended March 28 from 355,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. The number of people actually receiving benefits under regular state programs totaled 2,436,000 in the week ended March 21, the latest period for which that figure was available. That was down from 2,480,000 the previous week.  
label 8	SPANISH UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS SLIGHTLY IN MARCH Spain's registered unemployment fell by 10,465 people to 2.97 mln or 21.4 pct of the workforce in March, Labour Ministry figures show. Registered unemployment in February was 2.98 mln people, or 21.5 pct of the workforce. The figures were nonetheless higher than those for March 1986 -- 2.8 mln people and 21 pct of the workforce.  
label 8	PORTUGUESE UNEMPLOYMENT STEADY IN FIRST QUARTER Unemployment in Portugal held steady at 9.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987 after the same rate in the last quarter of 1986, the National Statistics Institute said. This compared with 11.1 pct unemployment in the first quarter of 1986. The total number of registered unemployed in the first quarter of this year was 437,500.

label 8	U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS BELOW THREE MLN IN MAY U.K. Unemployment fell a record provisional, seasonally-adjusted 64,300 in May to a total 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department said. In April, seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by an upwardly revised 21,600 to 3.02 mln or 10.9 pct, it said. The unadjusted jobless total in May, including school leavers, alos fell a record 121,000 to 2.99 mln or 10.8 pct from April's 3.11 mln, 11.2 pct. May was the eleventh successive decline from a peak last summer of 11.6 pct, the Employment Department said. "Unemployment has fallen to under three mln for the first time in over three years. The May fall of 64,000 was the largest drop since records were first kept (in 1948)," Employment Minister Norman Fowler said. All regions have seen above average falls in long term unemployment during the past year, he added. The last time the adjusted total of unemployed was below three mln was July 1984, while the unadjusted total was last below this level in June 1983.  
label 8	U.S. FIRST TIME JOBLESS CLAIMS ROSE IN WEEK New applications for unemployment insurance benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 in the week ended June 6 from 310,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. The number of people actually receiving benefits under regular state programs totaled 2,359,000 in the week ended May 30, the latest period for which that figure was available. That was up from 2,255,000 the previous week.  
label 9	EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO PREDICT - LONDON TRADE The outcome of today's European Community (EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos, traders said. Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining factor in today's result, they added.  
label 9	NORTH YEMEN CALLS SUGAR BUYING TENDER - TRADE North Yemen has called a buying tender for Saturday for the purchase of 30,000 tonnes of white sugar for arrival in June, traders said.  
label 9	RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said. As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season. Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane. Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture. Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said. Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said. The cane crush normally runs from June to December.  
label 9	FRENCH TRADERS FORECAST EC SUGAR TENDER The European Community (EC) is expected to award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000 and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said. They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50 Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864. Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but declined to give a rebate figure.

label 9	U.K. INTERVENTION BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES A total 118,350 tonnes of current series white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board said. Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added. Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes. Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy. Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season (1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks). Last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos.  
label 9	DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED Roughly half of this year's expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start," he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A" and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.  
label 9	EC COMMISSION DETAILS SUGAR TENDER The EC Commission confirmed it granted export licences for 118,350 tonnes of current series white sugar at a maximum export rebate of 46.496 European Currency Units (ECUs) per 100 kilos. Out of this, traders in France received 34,500 tonnes, in the U.K. 37,800, in West-Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes.  
label 9	EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY The maximum export rebate granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC Commission sources said. The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions. Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said. They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low. Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.  
label 9	CARGILL CONFIRMS WHITE SUGAR SALE TO INDIA London-based trader Cargill (U.K.) Ltd confirmed it sold one cargo of white sugar to India for shipment April 15/May 15 at yesterday's tender. Price details were not immediately available but some traders suggested business had been done around 220 dlrs a tonne cif. India tendered for one or two cargoes of white sugar. There was no specific requirement on shipping period.

label 10	HUNGARY RAISES PRICES IN EFFORT TO CURB DEFICIT Hungary has announced sharp price increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit. The official MTI news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said. MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances. Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to 47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between 30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion. A major tax reform, including the introduction of a Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in an effort to cure problems in state spending. But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's deficit under control. The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said. The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states, notably Poland.  
label 10	BANGLADESH COST OF LIVING INDEX FALLS IN JANUARY Bangladesh's cost of living index fell 1.09 pct in January to 479, after a 1.6 pct decline to 484.28 in December (1973-74 base 100), the Bureau of Statistics said. The cost of living index fell 0.14 pct to 434.49 in January 1986. In the year to January, inflation ran at 10.24 pct after an 11.3 pct rate a month earlier and 9.72 pct a year earlier.

label 10	PORTUGUESE CONSUMER PRICES UP 1.4 PCT IN MARCH Portugal's consumer prices rose 1.4 pct in March after a one pct increase in February and a 1.2 pct rise in March 1986, the National Statistics Institute said. The consumer price index (base 100 for 1976) rose to 772.0 from 761.3 in February and compared with 703.4 in March 1986. This gave a year-on-year March inflation rate of 9.8 pct against 9.5 pct in February and 12.2 pct in March 1986. Measured as an annual average rate, inflation in March was 10.9 pct compared with 11.1 pct in February. The government forecasts annual inflation of about eight pct this year.  
label 10	NEW ZEALAND CPI RISES 2.3 PCT IN MARCH QUARTER New Zealand's consumer price index, CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the quarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December 1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, the Statistics Department said. For the 12 months ended March 1987 the CPI rose 18.3 pct against 18.2 pct in 12 months ended December 1986 and 13.0 pct in the 12 months ended March 1986, it said in a statement. Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was contributed by the housing group, the department said. The December quarter was significantly affected by the introduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax, GST, in October 1986, it added. However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986 quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said. This is because of an unavoidable lag in price information, particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on household contents, it added.  
label 10	OECD CONSUMER PRICES RISE IN FEBRUARY Consumer prices in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique. The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index. The February increase was less than Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986. Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's 1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier, it said. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in February, in line with previous months, although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain. Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.  
label 10	PERU CONSUMER PRICES RISE 5.9 PCT IN MAY Peru's consumer price index rose 5.9 pct in May to 15,706.5 (base 1979) compared to 6.6 pct in April and 3.3 pct in May 1986, the National Statistics Institute said. It said accumulated inflation for the first five months of this year was 33.8 pct against 24.1 pct for the same period in 1986. Inflation for the year ending May 1987 was 75.7 pct compared to 76.8 pct for the year ending May 1986.

Sarney, addressing his cabinet live on television, also reiterated that he intended to remain in power for five years, until 1990. There has been a long-running political debate about how long his mandate should be. Brazil is currently suffering from the worst inflation of its history.

label 11	STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners. "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," he said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a "slight firming" of the yen against the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar. "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress," he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. "You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem," he said.  
label 11	TOP OFFICIALS ARRIVE AT TREASURY FOR G-5 TALKS Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.  
label 11	GROUP OF FIVE MEETING ENDS A meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Five ended after nearly three and a half hours. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson declined to comment on the meeting as they emerged from the U.S. Treasury. A European monetary official said the ministers of the Group of Seven countries would gather at about three p.m. local (1900 GMT) at the Treasury.  
label 11	INDUSTRIAL NATIONS RECONVENE FOR TALKS Financial ministers and central bankers of leading industrial nations reconvened here this afternoon. Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said on entering the meeting the ministers would review the Paris agreement. Asked if he was satisfied with West German and Japanese stimulus, Wilson replied, "They could do a little more." French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, meanwhile, confirmed there would be a communique at the end of the meeting. Finance ministers and central bankers of Britain, FRance, Canada and West Germany were seen by Reuter correspondents returning to a Treasury building. Japanese officials and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl did not appear to have left the building at the end of earlier Group of Five talks which broke up around 2 p.m. local time (1800 gmt). There was no sign, however, of the Italian delegation whose position was thrown into question this morning by the resignation of the Christian Democratic wing of Italy's Socialist-led government. European monetary officials said later that the Italian delegation was inside the building. This meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven was in progress.  
label 11	SWISS TO LAUNCH NEW SERIES OF MONEY MARKET PAPER The Swiss Federal Government will launch a new series of three month money market certificates totalling around 150 mln Swiss francs, the National Bank said. Subscriptions close April 14 and payment date is April 16. The last series of three month paper issued in March raised 147.3 mln francs at an issue price of 99.142 pct, giving an average annual yield of 3.501 pct.  
label 11	FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth. In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances." It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures." The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate. It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."  
label 11	G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve. At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental. "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

The Bank bought in band one, 60 mln stg bank bills at 9-7/8 pct and in band two 200 mln stg bank bills and one mln stg treasury bills at 9-13/16 pct. This brings the total help so far today to 364 mln stg, compared with its deficit estimate of 350 mln stg.  
label 11	LEBANESE POUND FALLS SHARPLY AGAINST DOLLAR The Lebanese Pound fell sharply against the U.S. Dollar again today with dealers attributing the decline to continued political uncertainty. The pound closed at 118.25/118.75 against the dollar compared to yesterday's close of 115.60/115.80. "Political deadlock is reflected in the pound's position. There was more demand and less on offer in the market," one dealer told Reuters. The pound, which was at 18 to the dollar in January, 1986, has lost more than 30 pct of its international value over the past three months.  
label 12	FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said. Economists expect the Fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset pressures from the end of the two-week bank reserve maintenance period today. Some also look for a permanent reserve injection to offset seasonal pressures via an outright purchase of bills or coupons this afternoon. The Federal funds rate opened at 6-3/8 pct and remained at that level, up from yesterday's 6.17 pct average.

As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy. "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report. "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said. He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts. Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.  
label 12	GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said. Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said. Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell. "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity." Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

Several Bahrain banks had been lending in the fixed periods and borrowing in the short dates, but today they found the day-to-day money in short supply, dealers said. "Everybody's stuck in the spot-next," one trader said. Spot-next rose to as high as 6-1/4, six pct from 5-1/4, five pct yesterday, and the borrowing interest spilled over into the periods, with one month rising to around 6-3/16, 5-15/16 pct from 5-15/16, 7/8 pct yesterday. Three months edged up to around 6-9/16, 5/16 pct from 6-7/16, 1/4 pct, while six months was quoted a touch firmer by some banks at seven, 6-3/4 pct. Commercial banks quoted the spot riyal at 3.7500/04 to the dollar after 3.7507/09 yesterday.

label 13	COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting," commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.  
label 13	COCOA TERMINAL DEPOSITS TO BE CUT 25 PCT - ICCH The basic deposit on cocoa futures contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10, taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said. The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to 150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said. The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability had warranted a cut in deposit rates. The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the spokesman said. The cuts were likely to attract more business to the market, he said.  
label 13	BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES Brazilian cocoa exporters are not likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA, members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to boost world prices, trade sources said. They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans. "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said. The traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde. The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria. "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.  
label 13	W.GERMAN COCOA GRIND UP 2.9 PCT IN FIRST QUARTER The West German cocoa grind rose 2.9 pct to 55,190 tonnes in the first quarter of 1987 from 53,643 tonnes in the same quarter of of 1986, the Bonn-based Confectionery Industry Association said in a statement. REUTER TAW  
label 13	WEST GERMAN COCOA GRINDINGS WITHIN EXPECTATIONS West German first quarter cocoa grindings, which rose 2.9 pct from the same 1986 quarter, were within expectations, trade sources said. They described the results, announced Saturday, as normal and unspectacular, considering that the grind in the fourth quarter was rather high and some was carried over into the first quarter. Grindings rose to 55,190 tonnes from 53,643 in the first 1986 quarter. A spokesman for the Confectionery Industry Association said that West German grindings are expected to stay relatively high in comparison to other West European countries.  
label 13	DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told Reuters. "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it," one company spokesman said. Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes. Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market. "Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said. "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back," he added. "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one processor said. "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods," he added. Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come.  
label 13	BRAZIL NOT SELLING TO COCOA BUFFER STOCK - TRADE Brazil is not selling cocoa beans to the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock, as spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct higher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stock manager, trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said. The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels, the sources noted. The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments, they added. If sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission, they said.  
label 13	COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases. One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price). However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

label 14	COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee. Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally Colombia's major export. The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987 coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.

Speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the reasons was that the market was already saturated and that producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln (60-kg) bags in 1987. Today, May futures in New York settled at 107.90 cents a lb.  
label 14	COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN Colombia's coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association said. "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told Reuters. On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and May for an unlimited amount. Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6, or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the average in recent years. He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by Colombia. "The only change that could happen is, because of the volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.

label 14	UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said. The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added. Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said. The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added. Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion. The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment. The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production. CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

label 14	MILD COFFEE GROWERS TO MEET IN GUATEMALA A large group of "other milds" coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month to map their strategy for next September's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO). Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five central american nations will participate in the two-day strategy session beginning May 4. The main topic will be reform of what many producing countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export quotas, Fernandez said. He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the real production and export potential of each country in the past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic" production levels rather than recent harvests and crop estimates.

Brazil said during a meeting of coffee producers in Rio de Janeiro over the weekend that it would consider leaving the ICO if its export quota was reduced by the organization.  
label 15	TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE Turkey said today its disputes with Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, should be solved through negotiations. A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security, economy and other rights of both countries. "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice. The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil. A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries," the Foreign Ministry statement said. Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed.  
label 15	IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS Iraq said today its troops were pushing Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of Basra early yesterday. A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a significant victory and were continuing to advance. Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked. The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks. "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said. (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.) The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down. Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.

IRNA said that under the agreement, Iran will also provide technical and scientific assistance in manpower training and oil exploitation, production and refining.  
label 15	U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL The United States' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977. "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990. "However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction," Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. "An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.

label 15	CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP SHARPLY IN EUROPE, U.S. Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore, according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline. The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S. relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly gasoline, and support from crude oil prices. Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or three pct from the previous week. In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to 19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct. Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct. But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices. Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of 68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week. For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs. On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A. also jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82 dlrs on higher gasoline prices.  
label 15	ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said. Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific. About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said. Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake. The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco. The government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return output to normal levels, the spokesman said.

label 15	KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas said. In an article headlined, "Gulf oil sources say Middle East production up 1.4 mln bpd," it warned OPEC's official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies. It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the European and American markets," the daily said. The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details. "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew," it said. The sources warned that "maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies," it said. "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March," it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts. "More than one official has warned OPEC would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May," it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.  
label 15	TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED Texaco Inc has re-established some key oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations. "Several companies say they are willing to start trading," Yates told Reuters in an interview. The company last week had stated that a number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether. Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings. Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P. Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits to cover transactions, it said. The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies. "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an avalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity." He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton said. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company, canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards. The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today said, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on supplying. They had cancelled last week." He declined to identify the company. &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said. But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the Algerians, he added. Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter 11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines and oil supplies that are key to the company's business. "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said Martin Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer and Traub. "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "But when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company." But other officials at Texaco were not immediately available to say whether discussions were being held with its banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.
