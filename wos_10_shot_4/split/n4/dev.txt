molecular_biology	abcc4 gene codes for a protein (abcc4) involved in the transportation of different classes of drugs outside the cells. various important drugs transported by abcc4 include antiviral and anticancer drugs as well as endogenous molecules such as bile acids, cyclic nucleotides, folates, prostaglandins and steroids. alternative splicing generates multiple mrnas that encode protein isoforms having diverse functions. in this study, we have identified a novel transcript of mouse abcc4 gene using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques. this transcript was found to be different from the reported transcript in having a different first exon that was found to be located on previously identified first intron. newly identified transcript was found to be expressed across different tissues we studied and in different developmental stages. expression level of novel and reported transcripts was studied using quantitative real-time pcr. after conceptually translating the novel transcript, various post-translational modifications were studied. translation efficiency and predicted half life of encoded protein isoforms were analysed in silico. molecular modelling was performed to compare the structural differences in both isoforms. the diversity at n-termini in these protein isoforms explains the diverse function of abcc4 in mouse.

molecular_biology	identification of fungi in dermatological samples using pcr is reliable and provides significantly improved results in comparison with cultures. it is possible to identify the infectious agent when negative results are obtained from cultures. in addition, identification of the infectious agent can be obtained in 1 day. conventional and real-time pcr methods used for direct fungus identification in collected samples vary by dna extraction methods, targeted dna and primers, and the way of analysing the pcr products. the choice of a unique method in a laboratory is complicated because the results expected from skin and hair sample analysis are different from those expected in cases of onychomycosis. in skin and hair samples, one dermatophyte among about a dozen possible species has to be identified. in onychomycosis, the infectious agents are mainly trichophyton rubrum and, to a lesser extent, trichophyton interdigitale, but also moulds insensitive to oral treatments used for dermatophytes, which renders fungal identification mandatory. the benefits obtained with the use of pcr methods for routine analysis of dermatological samples have to be put in balance with the relative importance of getting a result in a short time, the price of molecular biology reagents and equipment, and especially the time spent conducting laboratory manipulations.
molecular_biology	tuberculosis is one of the main etiologies to evoke in the context of lymphocyte pleurisy. however, diagnosis is difficult and is based on mycobac-teriology that is not enough sensitive and time-consuming, or on histology that requires invasive biopsy gesture. this literature review, carried out from med-line, summarizes the main meta-analyzes, reviews, and originator publications in english on biomarkers, classic and more innovative, studied for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. among the immuno-biochemical markers, interferon- gamma (ifn-gamma), isoenzyme of adenosine deaminase 2 (ada2) and total adenosine deaminase (ada) seem the most relevant with respective sensitivities of 89% (87-91), 97.2% (95 to 98.7) and 92% (90-93) and specificities of 97% (96-98), 94.2% (91.8 to 96) and 90% (89-91). about molecular biology, pcr xpert mtb/rif has a sensitivity of 46.4% (26.3 to 67.8), which is much higher than the direct examination, while providing rapid diagnostic confirmation, with a specificity of 99.1% (95.2 to 99.8), and a resistance to rifampicin screening. the release assay of interferon-gamma (igra) is less effective with a sensitivity of 75% (69-81) and a specificity of 82% (75-88) in blood and a sensitivity of 80% (74-86%) and a specificity of 72% (64-80) in pleural fluid. other biomarkers (including several cytokines) might have an interest but are still under evaluation. these innovative methods, particularly the determination of ada and the use of pcr xpert mtb/rif should find their place in the diagnostic algorithm of tb pleurisy.
molecular_biology	background: functionalized nanoparticles (nps) are one promising tool for detecting specific molecular targets and combine molecular biology and nanotechnology aiming at modern imaging. we aimed at ligand-directed delivery with a suitable target-biomarker to detect early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac). promising targets are galectins (gal), due to their strong expression in and on pdac-cells and occurrence at early stages in cancer precursor lesions, but not in adjacent normal tissues. results: molecular probes (10-29 aa long peptides) derived from human tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) were selected as binding partners to galectins. affinity constants between the synthesized t-pa peptides and gal were determined by microscale thermophoresis. the 29 aa-long t-pa-peptide-1 with a lactose-functionalized serine revealed the strongest binding properties to gal-1 which was 25-fold higher in comparison with the native t-pa protein and showed additional strong binding to gal-3 and gal-4, both also over-expressed in pdac. t-pa-peptide-1 was selected as vector moiety and linked covalently onto the surface of biodegradable iron oxide nanoparticles (nps). in particular, can-doped maghemite nps (can-mag), promising as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (mri), were selected as magnetic core and coated with different biocompatible polymers, such as chitosan (can-mag-chitosan nps) or polylactic co glycolic acid (plga) obtaining polymeric nanoparticles (can-mag@pnps), already approved for drug delivery applications. the binding efficacy of t-pa-vectorized nps determined by exposure to different pancreatic cell lines was up to 90%, as assessed by flow cytometry. the in vivo targeting and imaging efficacy of the vectorized nps were evaluated by applying murine pancreatic tumor models and assessed by 1.5 t magnetic resonance imaging (mri). the t-pa-vectorized nps as well as the protease-activated nps with outer shell decoration (can-mag@pnps-peg-regacp-peg/tpa-pep1lac) showed clearly detectable drop of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor staining-intensity indicating a considerable uptake of the injected nps. post mortem np deposition in tumors and organs was confirmed by fe staining of histopathology tissue sections. conclusions: the targeted nps indicate a fast and enhanced deposition of nps in the murine tumor models. the can-mag@pnps-peg-regacp-peg/tpa-pep1lac interlocking steps strategy of nps delivery and deposition in pancreatic tumor is promising.
molecular_biology	to perform pathogenic and pathological investigations on explosive epidemics of hyriopsis cumingii lea in hunan province, china between 2005 and 2011. we isolated pathogenic bacteria sj-2 from naturally infected hyriopsis cumingii lea, and the sj-2 strain was artificial infected into the normal hyriopsis cumingii lea by axe foot injection method. the strain was identified according to conventional bacteriological isolation and identification and molecular biology methods, and pathological changes caused by the bacteria in diseased mussel tissues were observed. according to morphological and culture characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests and 16s rdna molecular identification, sj-2 strain shares 99% sequence identity with the type strain of aeromonas veronii (a. veronii). results for antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that among 50 drugs, a. veronii was highly sensitive to 15 drugs, moderately sensitive to 5 drugs, and showed drug resistance to left drugs. macroscopical lesions, pathological changes and cytopathology were summarized. the pathogenic bacteria sj-2 was isolated from hyriopsis cumingii lea affected by explosive epidemic disease, and was identified as a. veronii. sj-2 strain caused multi-organ lesions and function failure in corresponding organs in the hyriopsis cumingii leal, resulting in gradually decreased and disappeared normal physiological metabolism, and eventually death.
molecular_biology	glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide and is usually diagnosed in higher age groups. the goal was to survey how patient age influences the development of glaucoma. a web-based search on aging of the visual system and its influence on glaucoma was performed and the most important results are summarized. the prevalence of glaucoma rises with age. aging processes of the trabecular meshwork and the uveoscleral outflow pathway lead to a rise in the intraocular pressure. chronically elevated intraocular pressure leads to remodelling of the lamina cribrosa and narrowing of its pores through which ganglion cell axons leave the eye. age-dependent glia cell, mitochondria and immune system alterations are discussed to influence glaucoma. patient age and further age-related nonophthalmological systemic diseases also influence adherence and persistence to the prescribed therapy. aging is an important risk factor for developing glaucoma and is a main factor which influences therapy and course of the disease. at this point in time it remains unclear to which extent additional factors determine the development of glaucoma.
molecular_biology	gastroesophageal (ge) malignancies make up a significant and growing segment of newly diagnosed cancers. approximately 80% of patients who have ge cancers die within 5 years of diagnosis, which means that effective treatments for these malignancies need to be found. currently, targeted therapies have a minimal role in this disease group. intensive study of the molecular biology of ge cancers is a relatively new and ongoing venture, but it has already led to a significant increase in our understanding of these malignancies. this understanding, although still limited, has the potential to enhance our ability to develop targeted therapies in conjunction with the ability to identify actionable gene mutations and perform genomic profiling to predict drug resistance. several cell surface growth factor receptors have been found to play a prominent role in ge cancer cell signaling. this discovery has led to the approval of 2 agents within the last few years: trastuzumab, an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) monoclonal antibody used in the first-line treatment of her2-positive ge cancers, and ramucirumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (vegfr2) monoclonal antibody that is currently used in later lines of therapy. this review discusses the current state of molecular testing in ge cancers, along with the known molecular biology and current and investigational treatments. the development of trastuzumab and ramucirumab represents a significant advance in our ability to make use of ge tumor molecular profiles. as our understanding of the impact of molecular aberrations on drug effectiveness and disease outcomes increases, we anticipate improved therapy for patients with ge cancers.
molecular_biology	nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) are a highly conserved gene family that form pentameric receptors involved in fast excitatory synaptic neurotransmission. the specific roles individual nachr subunits perform in drosophila melanogaster and other insects are relatively uncharacterized. of the 10 d. melanogaster nachr subunits, only three have described roles in behavioral pathways; d alpha 3 and d alpha 4 in sleep, and d alpha 7 in the escape response. other subunits have been associated with resistance to several classes of insecticides. in particular, our previous work has demonstrated that an allele of the d alpha 1 subunit is associated with resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides. we used ends-out gene targeting to create a knockout of the d alpha 1 gene to facilitate phenotypic analysis in a controlled genetic background. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a native function for any nachr subunits known to be targeted by insecticides. loss of d alpha 1 function was associated with changes in courtship, sleep, longevity, and insecticide resistance. while acetylcholine signaling had previously been linked with mating behavior and reproduction in d. melanogaster, no specific nachr subunit had been directly implicated. the role of d alpha 1 in a number of behavioral phenotypes highlights the importance of understanding the biological roles of nachrs and points to the fitness cost that may be associated with neonicotinoid resistance.
molecular_biology	cgg repeat expansion >200 within fmr1, termed full mutation (fm), has been associated with promoter methylation, consequent silencing of gene expression and fragile x syndrome (fxs)-a common cause of intellectual disability and co-morbid autism. unmethylated premutation (55-199 repeats) and fm alleles have been associated with fragile x related tremor/ataxia syndrome (fxtas), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder. here we present a 33-year-old male with fxs, with white matter changes and progressive deterioration in gait with cerebellar signs consistent with probable fxtas; there was no evidence of any other cerebellar pathology. we show that he has tissue mosaicism in blood, saliva, and buccal samples for the size and methylation of his expanded alleles and a de novo, unmethylated microdeletion. this microdeletion involves a similar to 80 bp sequence in the fmr1 promoter as well as complete loss of the cgg repeat in a proportion of cells. despite fmr1 mrna levels in blood within the normal range, the methylation and cgg sizing results are consistent with the diagnosis of concurrent fxs and probable fxtas. the demonstrated presence of unmethylated fm alleles would explain the manifestation of milder than expected cognitive and behavioral impairments and early onset of cerebellar ataxia. our case suggests that individuals with fxs, who manifest symptoms of fxtas, may benefit from more detailed laboratory testing.

molecular_biology	as maize was domesticated in mexico around 9,000years ago, local farmers have selected and maintained seed stocks with particular traits and adapted to local conditions. in the present day, many of these landraces are still cultivated; however, increased urbanization and migration from rural areas implies a risk that this invaluable maize germplasm may be lost. in order to implement an efficient mechanism of conservation in situ, the diversity of these landrace populations must be estimated. development of a method to select the minimum number of samples that would include the maximum number of alleles and identify germplasm harboring rare combinations of particular alleles will also safeguard the efficient ex-situ conservation of this germplasm. to reach this goal, a strategy based on ssr analysis and a novel algorithm to define a minimum collection and rare genotypes using landrace populations from puebla state, mexico, was developed as a proof of concept for methodology that could be extended to all maize landrace populations in mexico and eventually to other native crops. the ssr-based strategy using bulked dna samples allows rapid processing of large numbers of samples and can be set up in most laboratories equipped for basic molecular biology. therefore, continuous monitoring of landrace populations locally could easily be carried out. this methodology can now be applied to support incentives for small farmers for the in situ conservation of these traditional cultivars.
enzymology	a polygalacturonase (pg) isozyme was isolated from penicillium solitum-decayed anjou pear fruit and purified to homogeneity with a multistep process. both gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography revealed a single pg activity peak, and analysis of the purified protein showed a single band with a molecular mass of 43 kda, which is of fungal origin. the purified enzyme was active from ph 3.5-6, with an optimum at ph 4.5. pg activity was detectable 0-70 c with 50 c maximum. the purified isozyme was inhibited by the divalent cations ca2+, mg2+, mn2+ and fe2+ and analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis products revealed polygalacturonic acid monomers and oligomers. the purified enzyme has an isoelectric point of 5.3 and is not associated with a glycosylated protein. the pg isozyme macerated fruit tissue plugs in vitro and produced similar to 1.2-fold more soluble polyuronides from pear than from apple tissue, which further substantiates the role of pg in postharvest decay. data from this study show for the first time that the purified pg produced in decayed anjou pear by p. solitum, a weakly virulent fungus, is different from that pg produced by the same fungus in decayed apple.
enzymology	this review examines the mechanisms propelling cofactor-independent, organic cofactor-dependent and metal-dependent decarboxylase chemistry. decarboxylation, the removal of carbon dioxide from organic acids, is a fundamentally important reaction in biology. numerous decarboxylase enzymes serve as key components of aerobic and anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid conversion. in the past decade, our knowledge of the mechanisms enabling these crucial decarboxylase reactions has continued to expand and inspire. this review focuses on the organic cofactors biotin, flavin, nad, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, pyruvoyl, and thiamin pyrophosphate as catalytic centers. significant attention is also placed on the metal-dependent decarboxylase mechanisms.

enzymology	background: biodegradation of green algal cell wall requires specialized enzymatic machinery, which is not yet well characterized. results: structural and biochemical characterization of a new -glucuronyl hydrolase belonging to family gh105 active on oligo-ulvans. conclusion: the gh105 family encompasses enzymes cleaving both - and -linked glycosides. significance: investigations of enzymatic degradation of marine polysaccharides reveals enzymes with unique characteristics. ulvans are cell wall matrix polysaccharides in green algae belonging to the genus ulva. enzymatic degradation of the polysaccharide by ulvan lyases leads to the production of oligosaccharides with an unsaturated -glucuronyl residue located at the non-reducing end. exploration of the genomic environment around the nonlabens ulvanivorans (previously percicivirga ulvanivorans) ulvan lyase revealed a gene highly similar to known unsaturated uronyl hydrolases classified in the cazy glycoside hydrolase family 105. the gene was cloned, the protein was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and enzymology experiments demonstrated its unsaturated -glucuronyl activity. kinetic analysis of purified oligo-ulvans incubated with the new enzyme showed that the full substrate specificity is attained by three subsites that preferentially bind anionic residues (sulfated rhamnose, glucuronic/iduronic acid). the three-dimensional crystal structure of the native enzyme reveals that a trimeric organization is required for substrate binding and recognition at the +2 binding subsite. this novel unsaturated -glucuronyl hydrolase is part of a previously uncharacterized subgroup of gh105 members and exhibits only a very limited sequence similarity to known unsaturated -glucuronyl sequences previously found only in family gh88. clan-o formed by families gh88 and gh105 was singular in the fact that it covered families acting on both axial and equatorial glycosidic linkages, respectively. the overall comparison of active site structures between enzymes from these two families highlights how that within family gh105, and unlike for classical glycoside hydrolysis, the hydrolysis of vinyl ether groups from unsaturated saccharides occurs independently of the or configuration of the cleaved linkage.
enzymology	significant progress over the past few years has been achieved in the enzymology of microbial degradation and saccharification of plant xylan, after cellulose being the most abundant natural renewable polysaccharide. several new types of xylan depolymerizing and debranching enzymes have been described in microorganisms. despite the increasing variety of known glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases, some xylan structures still appear quite recalcitrant. this review focuses on the mode of action of different types of depolymerizing endoxylanases and their cooperation with p-xylosidase and accessory enzymes in breakdown of complex highly branched xylan structures. emphasis is placed on the enzymatic hydrolysis of alkali-extracted deesterified polysaccharide as well as acetylated xylan isolated from plant cell walls under non-alkaline conditions. it is also shown how the combination of selected endoxylanases and debranching enzymes can determine the nature of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides or lead to complete hydrolysis of the polysaccharide. the article also highlights the possibility for discovery of novel xylanolytic enzymes, construction of multifunctional chimeric enzymes and xylanosomes in parallel with increasing knowledge on the fine structure of the polysaccharide.

enzymology	iron-dependent enzymes are prevalent in nature and participate in a wide range of biological redox activities. frequently, high-valence iron intermediates are involved in the catalytic events of iron-dependent enzymes, especially when the activation of peroxide or molecular oxygen is involved. building on the fundamental framework of iron-oxygen chemistry, these reactive intermediates constantly attract significant attention from the enzymology community. during the past few decades, tremendous efforts from a number of laboratories have been dedicated to the capture and characterization of these intermediates to improve mechanistic understandings. in 2008, an unprecedented bis-fe(iv) intermediate was reported in a c-type diheme enzyme, maug, which is involved in the maturation of a tryptophan tryptophylquinone cofactor of methylamine dehydrogenase. this intermediate, although chemically equivalent to well-characterized high-valence iron intermediates, such as compound i, compound es, and intermediate q in methane monooxygenase, as well as the hypothetical fe(v) species in rieske non-heme oxygenases, is orders of magnitude more stable than these other high-valence species in the absence of its primary substrate. it has recently been discovered that the bis-fe(iv) intermediate exhibits a unique near-ir absorption feature which has been attributed to a novel charge-resonance phenomenon. this review compares the properties of maug with structurally related enzymes, summarizes the current knowledge of this new high-valence iron intermediate, including its chemical origin and structural basis, explores the formation and consequences of charge resonance, and recounts the long-range catalytic mechanism in which bis-fe(iv) participates. biological strategies for storing oxidizing equivalents with iron ions are also discussed.
enzymology	a new mathematical formula referred to as the planckian distribution equation (pde) has been found to fit long-tailed histograms generated in various fields of studies, ranging from atomic physics to single-molecule enzymology, cell biology, brain neurobiology, glottometrics, econophysics, and to cosmology. pde can be derived from a gaussian-like equation (gle) by non-linearly transforming its variable, x, while keeping the y coordinate constant. assuming that gle represents a random distribution (due to its symmetry), it is possible to define a binary logarithm of the ratio between the areas under the curves of pde and gle as a measure of the non-randomness (or order) underlying the biophysicochemical processes generating long-tailed histograms that fit pde. this new function has been named the planckian information, ip, which (i) may be a new measure of order that can be applied widely to both natural and human sciences and (ii) can serve as the opposite of the boltzmann-gibbs entropy, s, which is a measure of disorder. the possible rationales for the universality of pde may include (i) the universality of the wave-particle duality embedded in pde, (ii) the selection of subsets of random processes (thereby breaking the symmetry of gle) as the basic mechanism of generating order, organization, and function, and (iii) the quantity-quality complementarity as the connection between pde and peircean semiotics.
enzymology	over the last 10years, significant progress has been made in understanding the genetics, enzymology and structural components of the wybutosine (yw) biosynthetic pathway. these studies have played a key role in expanding our understanding of yw biosynthesis and have revealed unexpected evolutionary ties, which are presently being unraveled. the enzymes catalyzing the 5 steps of this pathway, from genetically encoded guanosine to wybutosine base, provide an ensemble of amazing reaction mechanisms that are to be discussed in this review article.
enzymology	vitamin b-6 is an essential cofactor that participates in a large number of biochemical reactions. pyridoxal phosphate is biosynthesized de novo by two different pathways (the dxp dependent pathway and the r5p pathway) and can also be salvaged from the environment. it is one of the few cofactors whose catabolic pathway has been comprehensively characterized. it is also known to function as a singlet oxygen scavenger and has protective effects against oxidative stress in fungi. enzymes utilizing vitamin b-6 are important targets for therapeutic agents. this review provides a concise overview of the mechanistic enzymology of vitamin b-6 biosynthesis and catabolism. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phosphate enzymology.

enzymology	atomic force microscopy (afm) is employed to reveal the morphological changes of the supported phospholipid bilayers hydrolyzed by a phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzyme in a buffer solution at room temperature. based on the high catalytic selectivity of pla(2) toward l-enantiomer phospholipids, five kinds of supported bilayers made of l- and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholines (dppc), including l-dppc (upper leaflet adjacent to solution)/l-dppc (bottom leaflet) (or l/l in short), l/d, d/d, and racemic ld/ld, were prepared on a mica surface in gel-phase, to explicate the kinetics and mechanism of the enzyme-induced hydrolysis reaction in detail. afm observations for the l/l bilayer show that the hydrolysis rate for l-dppc is significantly increased by pla(2) and most of the hydrolysis products desorb from substrate surface in 40 min. as d-enantiomers are included in the bilayer, the hydrolysis rate is largely decreased in comparison with the l/l bilayer. the time used to hydrolyze the as-prepared bilayers by pla(2) increases in the sequence of l/l, l/d, ld/ld, and d/l (d/d is inert to the enzyme action). d-enantiomers in the enantiomer hybrid bilayers remain on the mica surface at the end of the hydrolysis reaction. it was confirmed that the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by pla(2) preferentially occurs at the edges of pits or defects on the bilayer surface. the bilayer structures are preserved during the hydrolysis process. based on these observations, a novel kinetics model is proposed to quantitatively account for the pla(2)-catalyzed hydrolysis of the supported phospholipid bilayers. the model simulation demonstrates that pla(2) mainly binds with lipids at the perimeter of defects in the upper leaflet and leads to a hydrolysis reaction, yielding species soluble to the solution phase. the lipid molecules underneath subsequently flip up to the upper leaflet to maintain the hydrophilicity of the bilayer structure. our analysis shows that d-enantiomers in the hybrid bilayers considerably reduce the hydrolysis rate by its ineffective binding with pla(2).

enzymology	the sphingolipids are a diverse family of lipids with important roles in membrane compartmentalization, intracellular signaling, and cell-cell recognition. the central sphingolipid metabolite is ceramide, formed by the transfer of a variable length fatty acid from coenzyme a to a sphingoid base, generally sphingosine or dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) in mammals. this reaction is catalyzed by a family of six ceramide synthases (cers1-6). cers activity is usually assayed using either radioactive substrates or lc-ms/ms. we describe a cers assay with fluorescent, nbd-labeled sphinganine as substrate. the assay is readily able to detect endogenous cers activity when using amounts of cell or tissue homogenate protein that are lower than those reported for the radioactive assay, and the michaelis-menten constant was essentially the same for nbd-sphinganine and unlabeled sphinganine, indicating that nbd-sphinganine is a good substrate for these enzymes. using our assay, we confirm that the new clinical immunosuppressant fty720 is a competitive inhibitor of cers activity, and show that inhibition requires the compound 's lipid tail and amine head-group. in summary, we describe a fluorescent assay for cers activity that circumvents the need to use radioactive substrates, while being more accessible and cheaper than lc-ms based assays.-kim, h. j., q. qiao, h. d. toop, j. c. morris, and a. s. don. a fluorescent assay for ceramide synthase activity. j. lipid res. 2012. 53: 1701-1707.
southern_blotting	the cyp2e1 protein belongs to the p450 enzymes family and plays an important role in the metabolism of small molecular and organic pollutants. in this study we generated cyp2e1 transgenic plants of petunia using agrobacterium rhizogenes k599. pcr analysis confirmed that the regenerated plants contained the cyp2e1 transgene and the rolb gene of the ri plasmid. southern blotting revealed the presence of multiple copies of cyp2e1 in the genome of transgenic plants. fluorescent quantitative pcr revealed exogenous cyp2e1 gene expression in cyp2e1 transgenic plants at various levels, whereas no like expression was detected in either gus transgenic plants or wild-types. the absorption of benzene and toluene by transgenic plants was analyzed through quantitative gas chromatography. transgenic plants with high cyp2e1 expression showed a significant increase in absorption capacity of environmental benzene and toluene, compared to control gus transgenic and wild type plants. furthermore, these plants also presented obvious improved resistance to formaldehyde. this study, besides being the first to reveal that the cyp2e1 gene enhances plant resistance to formaldehyde, also furnishes a new method for reducing pollutants, such as benzene, toluene and formaldehyde, by using transgenic flowering horticultural plants.
southern_blotting	aims: this study focused on the cloning, expression and characterization of recombinant heparinase ii (rhepii) from bacteroides stercoris hj-15. methods and results: the heparinase ii gene from bact. stercoris hj-15 was identified by southern blotting and the sequence was deposited in genbank. the gene was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli, and rhepii was purified using two simple ion-exchange column chromatography steps. enzymatic properties and substrate specificities of rhepii were assessed and its kinetic constants were calculated. heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (hlgags) were digested with rhepii under optimal reaction conditions, and the products were analysed by sax-hplc. conclusions: the heparinase ii gene is 2322-bp long and consists of 773 amino acids. rhepii is most active in 50 mmol l-1 sodium phosphate buffer with 75 mmol l-1 nacl (ph 7 center dot 4) at 32 degrees c, and the activity is stable at 4 degrees c for 15 days on storage. acharan sulfate is the best substrate for rhepii, followed by heparan sulfate and heparin. the major degradation products were verified as highly sulfated disaccharides through sax-hplc analysis. it means that rhepii prefers iduronic acid over glucuronic acid on the hlgag structure. significance and impact of the study: this study provides easy and certain means for obtaining large amounts of pure rhepii and also provides important information regarding the tendencies of this enzyme and its digested products. rhepii digests hlgags in a different manner than heparinases from flavobacterium heparinum; therefore, we anticipate that rhepii will be a powerful tool for studies of gags and gags lyases.
southern_blotting	purpose. to identify rna missplicing events in human corneal endothelial tissue isolated from fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (fecd). methods. total rna was isolated and sequenced from corneal endothelial tissue obtained during keratoplasty from 12 patients with fecd and 4 patients undergoing keratoplasty or enucleation for other indications. the length of the trinucleotide repeat (tnr) ctg in the transcription factor 4 (tcf4) gene was determined using leukocyte-derived dna analyzed by a combination of southern blotting and genescan analysis. commercial statistical software was used to quantify expression of alternatively spliced genes. validation of selected alternative splicing events was performed by using rt-pcr. gene sets identified were analyzed for overrepresentation using web-based analysis system. results. corneal endothelial tissue from fecd patients containing a ctg tnr expansion sequence in the tcf4 gene revealed widespread changes in mrna splicing, including a novel splicing event involving fgfr2. differential splicing of numa1, ppfibp1, mbnl1, and mbnl2 transcripts were identified in all fecd samples containing a tnr expansion. the differentially spliced genes were enriched for products that localize to the cell cortex and bind cytoskeletal and cell adhesion proteins. conclusions. corneal endothelium from fecd patients harbors a unique signature of missplicing events due to ctg tnr expansion in the tcf4 gene, consistent with the hypothesis that rna toxicity contributes to the pathogenesis of fecd. changes to the endothelial barrier function, a known event in the development of fecd, was identified as a key biological process influenced by the missplicing events.
southern_blotting	the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) exerts important functions in controlling glucose and energy homeostasis. endogenous glp-1 has a very short half-life due to dpp-iv-mediated degradation and renal clearance, which limits the therapeutic use of native glp-1. we have shown previously that immunoglobulin fragment-fused glp-1 (glp-1/fc) is a structurally stable glp-1 analog. here, we report a non-viral glp-1/fc gene therapy strategy utilizing a rep78-in-trans and reb-in-cis element system to achieve a site-specific genomic integration. for this purpose, the glp-1/fc expression cassette, which is fused with the rbe element, was co-injected with the rep78 plasmid into the muscles of transgenic mice carrying the aavs1 locus of human chromosome 19. the rep protein-mediated site-specific integration was demonstrated by nested pcr, dot-blot, and southern blotting. we found that this approach reduced weight gain and improved lipid profiles in the aavs1-mice on high-fat diet challenge. our observations reveal a new glp-1 therapeutic strategy with an apparent absence of side effects, which may find applications in diabetes treatment and obesity prevention (c) 2010 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
southern_blotting	genetic characterisation of linezolid-resistant gram-positive cocci in a multicentre study in china has not been reported previously. to study the mechanism underlying the resistance of linezolid-resistant isolates, nine enterococcus faecalis, one enterococcus faecium and three staphylococcus cohnii isolates with various levels of resistance were collected from five hospitals across china in 2009-2012. the nine e. faecalis isolates were classified into seven sequence types, indicating that these linezolid-resistant e. faecalis isolates were polyclonal. enterococci isolates had reduced susceptibility to linezolid (mics of 48 mg/l) and had mutation of ribosomal protein l3, with three also having mutation of l4, but without the multidrug resistance gene cfr or the 23s rrna mutation g2576t. the three s. cohnii isolates were highly resistant to linezolid (mics of 64 mg/l to >256 mg/l), harboured the cfr gene and had the 23s rrna mutation g2576t. southern blotting indicated that the cfr gene of these three isolates resided on different plasmids (phk01, prm01 and pra01). in plasmid phk01, is21-558 and the cfr gene were integrated into transposon tn558. in plasmids prm01 and pra01, the cfr gene was flanked by two copies of an is256-like insertion sequence, indicating that the transferable form of linezolid resistance is conferred by the cfr gene. in conclusion, the emergence of linezolid-resistant gram-positive cocci in different regions of china is of concern. the cfr gene and the 23s rrna mutation contribute to high-level linezolid resistance in s. cohnii, and the l3 and l4 mutations are associated with low-level linezolid resistance in enterococci.

southern_blotting	human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) causes adult t-cell leukemia (atl) after a long latency period of about 60 years. as the mature t-cell neoplasms that emerge in patients infected with htlv-1 are often atl, t-cell neoplasms developing in such patients tend to be diagnosed simply as atl without further investigation. however, not all t-cell neoplasms that develop in htlv-1-infected cases are atl. mature t-cell malignancies other than atl should be carefully excluded in patients infected with htlv-1, as these sometimes closely resemble atl in their clinical, morphological, and histological features. here, we present a case of peripheral t-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (ptcl-nos) in an htlv-1 carrier. confirmation of monoclonal integration of the virus with southern blotting leads to a definite diagnosis of atl. although we did not detect the monoclonal integration band of htlv-1 in this case, the high htlv-1 proviral load complicated the diagnosis. multicolor flow cytometric analysis clearly showed that htlv-1 was not integrated in the tumor cells, and facilitated discrimination of ptcl-nos from atl.
southern_blotting	the cooh terminal of ptha encoding three nuclear localizing signals (nls) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from the plasmid of xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, the pathogen of citrus canker disease. then the sense and antisense strands of the nls were cloned into pbi121 vector. ptha-nls driven by the camv35 s promoter was transferred into sweet orange via agrobacterium -mediated transformation. successful integration was confirmed by pcr and southern blotting, and 12 sense-nls (nls (+)) and 9 antisense-nls (nls (-)) transgenic clones were obtained. the expression of nls fragment was analyzed by rt-pcr, real time q-pcr and western blotting, in which the specific nls protein was detected only in nls (+) transgenic clones. in an in vitro assay, when pin-puncture inoculation was performed with 2.5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of bacterial solution, the nls (+) transgenic clones showed no typical lesion development, while typical symptoms were observed in the wild types and the nls (-) transgenic clones. in vivo assay results indicated that the nls (+) transgenic clones showed less disease incidence, in comparison with the wild types and the nls (-) transgenic clones, when pin-puncture inoculation was performed with 10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml. the minimum disease incidence was 23.3% for 'sucarri' sweet orange and 33.3% for 'bingtang' sweet orange. when 10(4)-10(7) cfu/ml of pathogen was spray inoculated, the nls (+) transgenic clones did not show any symptom, and even the concentration raised to 10(9) cfu/ml, the disease incidence was 20-80%, while the wild types and the nls (-) transgenic clones had 100% disease development with whatever concentration of inoculum. two transgenic clones were confirmed to be resistant to citrus canker disease in the repeated inoculation. the results suggested that the transformation of nls sense strands may offer an effective way to acquire resistance to citrus canker disease.
southern_blotting	background: shwachman-diamond syndrome (sds) is an autosomal recessive ribosomopathy caused mainly by compound heterozygous mutations in sbds. structural variation (sv) involving the sbds locus has been rarely reported in association with the disease. we aimed to determine whether an sv contributed to the pathogenesis of a case lacking biallelic sbds point mutations. case presentation: whole exome sequencing was performed in a patient with sds lacking biallelic sbds point mutations. array comparative genomic hybridization and southern blotting were used to seek svs across the sbds locus. locus-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) encompassing flanking intronic sequence was also performed to investigate mutation within the locus. rna expression and western blotting were performed to analyze allele and protein expression. we found the child harbored a single missense mutation in sbds (c.98a >c; p. k33t), inherited from the mother, and an sv in the sbds locus, inherited from the father. the missense allele and sv segregated in accordance with mendelian expectations for autosomal recessive sds. complementary dna and western blotting analysis and locus specific pcr support the contention that the sv perturbed sbds protein expression in the father and child. conclusion: our findings implicate genomic rearrangements in the pathogenesis of some cases of sds and support patients lacking biallelic sbds point mutations be tested for sv within the sbds locus.
southern_blotting	understanding the molecular evolution of genes that underlie intraspecific polymorphisms can provide insights into the process of adaptive evolution. for adaptive polymorphisms characterized by gene presence/absence (p/a) variation, underlying loci commonly show signatures of long-term balancing selection, with gene-presence and gene-absence alleles maintained as two divergent lineages. we examined the molecular evolution of two unlinked p/a polymorphisms that underlie a well-documented adaptive polymorphism for cyanogenesis (hydrogen cyanide release with tissue damage) in white clover. both cyanogenic and acyanogenic plants occur in this species, and the ecological forces that maintain this chemical defence polymorphism have been studied for several decades. using a sample of 65 plants, we investigated the molecular evolution of sequences flanking the two underlying cyanogenesis genes: ac/ac (controlling the presence/absence of cyanogenic glucosides) and li/li (controlling the presence/absence of their hydrolysing enzyme, linamarase). a combination of genome walking, pcr assays, dna sequence analysis and southern blotting was used to test whether these adaptive p/a polymorphisms show evidence of long-term balancing selection, or whether gene-absence alleles have evolved repeatedly through independent deletion events. for both loci, we detect no signatures of balancing selection in the closest flanking genomic sequences. instead, we find evidence for variation in the size of the deletions characterizing gene-absence alleles. these observations strongly suggest that both of these polymorphisms have been evolving through recurrent gene deletions over time. we discuss the genetic mechanisms that could account for this surprising pattern and the implications of these findings for mechanisms of rapid adaptive evolution in white clover.
southern_blotting	abnormal telomere lengths have been linked to cancer and other hematologic disorders. determination of mean telomere content (mtc) is traditionally performed by southern blotting and densitometry, giving a mean telomere restriction fragment (trf) value for the total cell population studied. here, we compared a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach (qpcr) and a flow cytometric approach, fluorescence in situ hybridization (flow-fish), to evaluate telomere content distribution in total patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells or specific cell populations. flow-fish is based on in situ hybridization using a fluorescein-labeled peptide nucleic acid (pna) (ccctaa)(3) probe and dna staining with propidium iodide. we showed that both qpcr and flow-fish provide a robust measurement, with flow-fish measuring a relative content longer than qpcr at a single cell approach and that trf2 fluorescence intensity did not correlate with mtc. both methods showed comparable telomere content reduction with age, and the rate of relative telomere loss was similar. published 2016 wiley periodicals inc. this article is a us government work and, as such, is in the public domain in the united states of america.
northern_blotting	the prostate is composed mainly of epithelial and stromal cells, whose dynamic interaction is vital to a broad array of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. to understand intercellular communication in the development and progression of prostatic diseases, we examined gene expression in tissues from five patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). fibroblasts and epithelial cells derived from these tissues were grown in a primary co-culture system that retains many characteristics of the intact human prostate. the mrna levels of expressed genes as assessed by differential-display reverse transcription-pcr revealed that 110 genes were differentially expressed in co-cultured fibroblasts and epithelial cells, compared with expression in separately cultured cells. eighty-four of these were confirmed by reverse northern blotting, and 68 were successfully sequenced. of the sequenced genes, 43 were differentially expressed in epithelial cells (37 upregulated, 6 downregulated), and 25 were differentially expressed in fibroblasts (6 upregulated, 19 downregulated) in co-cultures versus separate cultures. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of 12 genes with known functions showed that five of these were differentially expressed in co-cultured cells. human kallikrein gene 7 (klk7) was markedly upregulated in co-cultured compared with separately cultured epithelial cells (p<0.001), whereas s100 calcium binding protein all, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, cyclin i, and latexin were significantly downregulated in co-cultured fibroblasts (p<0.05). quantitative real-time rt-pcr and western blot analysis confirmed klk7 up-regulation at both the mrna and protein levels, respectively. thus, epithelial-stromal cell interaction and communication are likely to be important in bph. epithelial cells and fibroblasts may interplay coordinately or collaboratively to influence cellular growth and death through dynamically differential gene expression in response to physiological and pathophysiological changes.
northern_blotting	microrna1511 (mir1511) is a small rna with unknown function identified in several plants by deep sequencing. in this study, we showed that this small rna is an authentic mirna by analyzing the structure of the precursor stem-loop containing the newly identified mir1511* sequence. we confirmed this result by northern blotting analysis. we used 5'race to identify one of the target genes (gmrpl4a) cleaved by both mir1511 and mir1511*. the site cleaved by mir1511* was located in the first exon of gmrpl4a, and the site cleaved by mir1511 was located in the second exon. the expression level of mir1511/1511* was higher in leaves than in roots and stems. in contrast, the lowest level of gmrpl4a expression was in the leaves and the highest in the root. these results indicate that an mirna can co-regulate with an mirna* to cleave the same target gene in plants, and that the level of gmrpl4a mrna is regulated by mir1511/1511*.
northern_blotting	differential display (dd) experiments were performed on drought-tolerant rice (oryza sativa l.) genotype n22 to identify both upregulated and down-regulated partial cdnas with respect to moisture stress. dna polymorphism was detected between drought-stressed and control leaf tissues on the dd gels. a partial cdna showing differential expression, with respect to moisture stress was isolated from the gel. northern blotting analysis was performed using this, cdna as a probe and it was observed that mrna corresponding to this transcript was accumulated to high level in rice leaves under water deficit stress. at the dna sequence level, the partial cdna showed homology with psb a gene encoding for d1 protein.
northern_blotting	analysis of the genome of chaetoceros salsugineum nuclear inclusion virus (csniv) revealed the presence of six putative open reading frames (orfs) in the genome. we further characterized orf3, which encodes a putative coat protein. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using orf3 gene-specific primers amplified a single dna band nearly 1.2 kb. this amplified product was gel-purified, cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. specific antiserum was raised against the recombinant protein and used for western blotting to test whether the orf3 protein is the csniv coat protein. one major csniv protein of approximately 46 kda reacted positively with the antiserum, suggesting that this antiserum is specific for the csniv coat protein. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) analysis of the 46 kda structural band revealed 14 peptide sequences that matched the orf3 regions of csniv. the expression of orf3 in host cells was examined by constructing a cdna library of csniv-infected cells. nucleotide sequences of the cdna clones were complementary to various regions of both csniv orf3 and orf4; however, no clones containing only the orf3 region were identified. also, northern blotting revealed a single 2.5-kb transcript, indicating that orf3 could be transcribed together with orf4.

northern_blotting	aims: trophoblast fusion in the placenta is prerequisite to successful pregnancy and the pathological conditions related to it. the presence of syncytin-1, is not sufficient to explain the complete event and adam12 is a major co-player candidate. via differential splicing, the adam12 gene produces a short and a long form, being the adam12-s and the adam12-l respectively. methods and results: we investigated the localisation of both variants in the human placenta using whole mount in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry and northern blotting in 1st (n = 8) and 3rd (n = 8) trimester placentae and in the case of nb in several cell lines. in northern blotting, 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for the adam12-s and bewo, 293hek, jar, leucocytes, macrophages, 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for adam12-l. in whole mount in situ hybridisation, the 1st and 3rd trimester placental syncytium was positive for both variants. in immunohistochemistry, adam12-l localised in the cytotrophoblast of both 1st and 3rd trimester placentae, while adam12-s localised in the complete syncytium, often including the cytotrophoblast. conclusion: the different localisation of adam12-s and adam12-l indicates a possible different role making adam12-l a candidate for the fusion event, while the syncytial localisation of the adam12-s makes it a candidate for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions between the placental syncytium and the maternal interface.

northern_blotting	alpha-farnesene is a volatile sesquiterpene in the natural coating of apple fruit. oxidation products of this sesquiterpene are thought to induce superficial scald in apple. a cdna encoding a-farnesene synthase converting farnesyl diphosphate to a-farnesene was obtained by using rt-pcr from peel of apple fruit (accession no. ay563622). comparison of the sequence of the cdna with afs-1 gene registered in the genbank (ay182241) showed that these sequences shared high similarity in nucleotide sequence and homology in deduced amino acid sequence. southern blotting suggested that there was only one copy in the genome of apple. northern blotting showed that the afs gene played a key role in a-farnesene synthesis during the 10 days after apples were removed from cold storage and warmed to room temperature. expression of the afs gene was influenced by treatment with dpa and 1-mcp.
northern_blotting	a nifu- like gene exhibiting similarity to nifu of nitrogen fixation gene cluster was identified for the first time from the gut cdna library of amphioxus branchiostoma belcheri. both rt- pcr and northern blotting as well as in situ hybridization histochemistry verified that the cdna represents an amphioxus nifu- like gene rather than a microbial contaminant. the nifulike gene encodes a protein of 164 amino acid residues including a highly- conserved u- type motif ( c-x-26 -c-x-43 -c), and shares 66 - 86% identity to nifu- like proteins from a variety of species including vertebrates, invertebrates and microbes. it is expressed in a tissue- specific manner in the digestive system including epipharyngeal groove, endostyle, hepatic caecum and hindgut and in the gill, ovary and testis. taken together, it is highly likely that nifu- like protein plays some tissue- dependent and critical role in amphioxus.
northern_blotting	to date, molecular evidence studies for bladder cancer, using the microarray technology, are focusing on the transitional cell carcinoma, however, similar fingerprinting studies have rarely been performed on the other molecular phenotypes of bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma (scc). this study was conducted to monitor the gene expression profiles for bilharzial-related scc of the bladder to be able to compare its data with transitional cell carcinoma microarray data. a total of 17 paired bilharzial urinary bladder scc specimens and their corresponding normal urothelium were analyzed using the complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray hybridization approach to study the molecular basis of the development of scc of the urinary bladder. validation of the microarray results was performed using the northern blotting technique. after supervised analysis of the microarray data, there was at least a 3-fold difference in the expression between scc of the bladder and normal urothelium in 82 genes. a total of 38 genes were up-regulated in scc of the bladder, including matrix degradation-related genes, growth factors, different oncogenes, and immunology related genes. conversely, 44 genes were down-regulated in scc of the bladder, including integrins, laminins, cadherins, nonmetastatic cell 1 (nm23) and apoptosis-related genes. our findings can explain the aggressive behavior of scc of the bladder. such gene profiling studies will add to our understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and may also improve our ability to diagnose and treat bladder cancer.

northern_blotting	long non-coding rnas (lncrnas), which represent a new frontier in molecular biology, play important roles in regulating gene expression at epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. more and more lncrnas have been found to play important roles in normal cell physiological activities, and participate in the development of varieties of tumors and other diseases. previously, we have only been able to determine the function of lncrnas through multiple mechanisms, including genetic imprinting, chromatin remodeling, splicing regulation, mrna decay, and translational regulation. application of technological advances to research into the function of lncrnas is extremely important. the major tools for exploring lncrnas include microarrays, rna sequencing (rna-seq), northern blotting, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr), fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), rna interference (rnai), rna-binding protein immunoprecipitation (rip), chromatin isolation by rna purification (chirp), crosslinking-immunopurification (clip), and bioinformatic prediction. in this review, we highlight the functions of lncrnas, and advanced methods to research lncrna-protein interactions.
northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are small noncoding regulatory rnas that reduce stability and/or translation of fully or partially sequence-complementary target mrnas. recent evidence indicates that mirnas can function both as tumor suppressors and as oncogenes. it has been demonstrated that in glioblastoma multiforme mir-21 and 221 are upregulated whereas mir-128 and 181 are downregulated. expression of mir-21, 221, 128a, 128b, 128c, 181a, 181b, 181c was studied using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting for human astrocytic tumors with different grade of malignancy. mir-21 and 221 were overexpressed in glioma samples, whereas mirna 181b was downregulated compared with normal brain tissue. mirna-21 was hyperexpressed in all tumor samples whereas higher levels of mirna-221 were found in high-grade gliomas. this study is the first analysis of mirnas in astrocytic tumor at different stages of malignancy. the different expression pattern observed in tumors at different stages of malignancy is probably dependent on the cell-specific repertoire of target genes of tumors sharing different molecular pathways activity and suggests mirnas may have also a place in diagnosis and staging of brain tumors.
human_metabolism	modern medicine pays a great attention to environmental security, i.e. to elimination of adverse health effects due to environmental factors. from the end of twentieth century, the environment became a source of urban and industry induced threats, such as: air and water microbe and chemical pollution, increased levels of ionizing radiation, and high risk of traumas. essentially, the food, as very important environmental factor, has also changed in the modern era due to new agriculture technologies, refining, synthetic food additives, the influences of ultra-high and ultra-low temperatures, gene engineering, etc. on the other hand, one of the important achievements of the modern medicine is an introduction of functional foods for maintenance of homeostasis of human metabolism under the current environmental conditions. imbalance between free radicals in organism induced by a variety of stresses and dietary antioxidants is one of the factors damaging human health. bioantioxidants, i.e. antioxidants naturally engaged in metabolism, are of special value for medical purposes of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. the adverse effects related to the bioantioxidant deficiency are generated by the accumulation of products arising from oxidation induced by free radicals. an increased need for bioantioxidants may emerge under specific conditions: (1) stress, (2) exposure to ionizing radiation, xenobiotics and another harmful man-made factors of the environment, (3) too much or too little physical activity due to traumas and rescue efforts, (4) administration of pharmaceuticals activating processes of oxidation induced by free radicals, such as antibiotics, narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics, and non-steroid anti-inflammatory preparations. the alcohol-free dietary concentrate enoant developed by the national institute for vine and wine ""magarach"" represents a practical approach to use the cabernet sauvignon grape for prevention and treatment of various maladies. experimental and clinical studies have shown curative and preventive benefits of enoant as a part of methodology used in catastrophe medicine. these may contribute to the achievement, with better effectiveness, of clinical goals in complex treatment and rehabilitation of humans, possessing impaired functions of the cardio-respiratory system, red blood cells, the antioxidant system and lipid metabolism by improving the immunity and lessening of toxic side effects of radiation and pharmacotherapy. data from experiments and clinical studies on effects exerted by enoant indicate that the criteria for optimization of medical technologies should include both a sufficient daily dose of the concentrate and the absence of individual negative reactions or grape-induced allergy.
human_metabolism	glycogen synthase kinase 3 (gsk-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase. development of gsk3 inhibitor alsterpaullone as a therapeutic agent for mood disorders, such as alzheimer 's disease and bipolar disorder, required the synthesis of a suitably labeled drug product for use in human metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies. owing to the potential metabolic degradation of the molecule, a multi-labeled approach utilizing (14)c was adopted. the synthesis of [(14)c]alsterpaullone was accomplished in separate routes from methyl-[1, 2-(14)c]-2-bromoacetate and [1, 2-(14)c]-2-bromoethanol, respectively. labeled versions were combined on the basis of molar radioactivity giving a final product with a radiochemical purity of 99.0% and a specific activity of 54.0 mci/mmol.
human_metabolism	pregnane x receptor (pxr), a member of the nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily, is expressed in liver and intestine, as also in other tissues and cells. pxr is activated by a wide variety of endobiotics, dietary compounds and pharmaceuticals. this nuclear receptor serves as a master transcriptional regulator of cyp3a isozymes, and also regulates a large number of enzymes and transporters involved in the pharmacokinetics of both endobiotics and xenobiotics. pxr has an impact on energy homeostasis through glucose and lipid metabolism regulation. pxr activation is also hepatoprotective against toxic bile acids. new roles for pxr have been identified in bone homeostasis, inflammatory bowel disease, liver steatosis and fibrogenesis. pxr directly regulates the expression of multidrug resistance protein 1 (mdr1) and other important proteins involved in drug metabolism. drug-drug interactions can affect patients with cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, hiv and cancer. especially cancer patients are at high risk of such interactions, as treated with multi-drug combinations. pxr activation can affect the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, thus targeting pxr may represent a novel strategy for the improvement of the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents, thereby providing safer and more effective therapies for cancer patients.
human_metabolism	this work is intended to design an integration sensor for non-invasive blood glucose detection (isnbgd) with low power consumption, fast detection speed and high accuracy. based on the modified conservation of energy metabolism theory, the blood glucose level (bgl) is acquired by a multi-linear regression equation of a rate of human metabolism, blood flow, oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and pulse frequency. these physiological parameters are obtained by isnbgd with a size of 60mm x 30mm x 85.5mm, which is integrated with temperature sensors, humidity sensors, radiation sensors, and dual wavelength photo-detectors with 660nm and 905nm. 30 healthy volunteers are involved in the preliminary clinical experiment. these blood glucose concentrations ranging from 3.5 to 6.5mmol/l are compared with automatic biochemical analyzer (aba) as the gold standard. the correlation coefficient of bgl is up to 0.8621 between the isnbgd and aba, and the isnbgd has strong correlation and good coherence. moreover, multi-physiological parameters can be measured by the isnbgd including body temperature, local metabolic rate, blood flow, oxygen saturation, and heart rate simultaneously.
human_metabolism	human metabolic diseases are typically network diseases. this holds not only for multifactorial diseases, such as metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes, but even when a single gene defect is the primary cause, where the adaptive response of the entire network determines the severity of disease. the latter may differ between individuals carrying the same mutation. understanding the adaptive responses of human metabolism naturally requires a systems biology approach. modelling of metabolic pathways in microorganisms and some mammalian tissues has yielded many insights, qualitative as well as quantitative, into their control and regulation. yet, even for a well-known pathway such as glycolysis, precise predictions of metabolite dynamics from experimentally determined enzyme kinetics have been only moderately successful. in the present review, we compare kinetic models of glycolysis in three cell types (african trypanosomes, yeast and skeletal muscle), evaluate their predictive power and identify limitations in our understanding. although each of these models has its own merits and shortcomings, they also share common features. for example, in each case independently measured enzyme kinetic parameters were used as input. based on these 'lessons from glycolysis', we will discuss how to make best use of kinetic computer models to advance our understanding of human metabolic diseases.
human_metabolism	conjugated linoleic acids (clas) affect body fat gain, carcinogenesis, insulin resistance, and lipid peroxidation in mammals. several isomers of cla exist, of which the (9z, 11e) and (10e, 12z) isomers have beneficial effects on human metabolism but are scarce in foods. bacterial polyunsaturated fatty acid isomerases are promising biotechnological catalysts for cla production. we describe six crystal structures of the propionibacterium acnes polyunsaturated fatty acid isomerase pai in apo- and product-bound forms. the three-domain flavoprotein has previously undescribed folds outside the fad-binding site. conformational changes in a hydrophobic channel toward the active site reveal a unique gating mechanism for substrate specificity. the geometry of the substrate binding site explains the length preferences for c18 fatty acids. a catalytic mechanism for double-bond isomerization is formulated that may be altered to change substrate specificity for syntheses of rare clas from easily accessible precursors.
human_metabolism	the in vitro metabolisms of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2c-b), 5-methoxy-n,n-diisopropyltryptamine (5-meo-dipt), and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine (2c-t-7) were studied using testliver (tm)-rat and testliver (tm)-human, which are new three-dimensional rat and human hepatocyte culture systems, respectively. the metabolites produced in the incubation media were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the data obtained with the in vitro system of rat origin were carefully compared with those obtained by rat in vivo experiments; most of the metabolites found in the in vivo experiments could be reproduced in the present three-dimensional in vitro experiments, although quantitative metabolite distribution patterns obtained with the three-dimensional system was somewhat different from those of in vivo experiments. because human in vivo experiments are not possible, especially for dubious designer drugs, the in vitro experiments using the three-dimensional human hepatocyte culture system seem very useful for studying human metabolism of new designer drugs as an alternative to human experiments.
human_metabolism	n-glycans play an essential role in biological process and are associated with age, gender, and body mass parameters in caucasian populations, whereas no study has been reported in chinese populations. to investigate the correlation between n-glycan structures and metabolic syndrome (mets) components, we conducted a population-based study in 212 chinese han individuals. the replication study was performed on 520 unrelated individuals from a croatian island korcula. the most prominent observation was the consistent positive correlations between different forms of triantennary glycans and negative correlations between glycans containing core-fucose with mets components including bmi, sbp, dbp, and fasting plasma glucose (fpg) simultaneously. significant differences in a number of n-glycan traits were also detected between normal and abnormal groups of bmi, bp, and fpg, respectively. in the multivariate analysis, the level of monosialylated glycans (structure loadings = -0.776) was the most correlated with the mets related risk factors, especially with sbp (structure loadings = 0.907). results presented here are showing that variations in the composition of the n-glycome in human plasma could represent the alternations of human metabolism and could be potential biomarkers of mets.
human_metabolism	human biomonitoring (hbm) of dose and biochemical effect nowadays has tremendous utility providing an efficient and cost effective means of measuring human exposure to chemical substances. hbm considers all routes of uptake and all sources which are relevant making it an ideal instrument for risk assessment and risk management. hbm can identify new chemical exposures, trends and changes in exposure, establish distribution of exposure among the general population, identify vulnerable groups and populations with higher exposures and identify environmental risks at specific contaminated sites with relatively low expenditure. the sensitivity of hbm methods moreover enables the elucidation of human metabolism and toxic mechanisms of the pollutants. so, hbm is a tool for scientists as well as for policy makers. blood and urine are by far the most approved matrices. hbm can be done for most chemical substances which are in the focus of the worldwide discussion of environmental medicine. this especially applies for metals, pah, phthalates, dioxins, pesticides, as well as for aromatic amines, perfluorinated chemicals, environmental tobacco smoke and volatile organic compounds. protein adducts, especially hb-adducts, as surrogates of dna adducts measuring exposure as well as biochemical effect very specifically and sensitively are a still better means to estimate cancer risk than measuring genotoxic substances and their metabolites in human body fluids. using very sophisticated but nevertheless routinely applicable analytical procedures hb-adducts of alkylating agents, aromatic amines and nitro aromatic compounds are determined routinely today. to extend the spectrum of biochemical effect monitoring further methods should be elaborated which put up with cleavage and separation of the adducted protein molecules as a measure of sample preparation. this way all sites of adduction as well as further proteins, like serum albumin could be used for hbm. dna-adducts indicate the mutagenicity of a chemical substance as well as an elevated cancer risk. dna-adducts therefore would be ideal parameters for hbm. though there are very sensitive techniques for dna adduct monitoring like p32-postlabelling and immunological methods they lack specificity. for elucidating the mechanism of carcinogenesis and for a broad applicability and comparability in epidemiological studies analytical methods must be elaborated which are strictly specific for the chemical structure of the dna-adduct. current analytical possibilities however meet their borders. in hbm studies with exposure to genotoxic chemicals especially the measurement of dna strand breaks in lymphocytes and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) in white blood cells has become very popular. however, there is still a lack of well-established dose response relations between occupational or environmental exposures and the induction of 8-ohdg or formation of strand breaks which limits the applicability of these markers. most of the biomarkers used in population studies are covered by standard operating procedures (sops) as well as by internal and external quality assessment schemes. therefore, hbm results from the leading laboratories worldwide are analytically reliable and comparable. newly upcoming substances of environmental relevance like perfluorinated compounds can rapidly be assessed in body fluids because there are very getting more and more difficult for the laboratories to keep up with a progress in instrumental analyses. in spite of this it will pay to reach the ultimate summit of hbm because it is the nly way to identify and quantify human exposure and risk, elucidate the mechanism of toxic effects and to ultimately decide if measures have to be taken to reduce exposure. risk assessment and risk management without hbm lead to wrong risk estimates and cause inadequate measures. in some countries like in usa and in germany, thousands of inhabitants are regularly investigated with respect to their internal exposure-to a broad range of environmentally occurring substances. for the evaluation of hbm results the german hbm commission elaborates reference- and hbm-values.

human_metabolism	1. a model that predicts human metabolism and disposition of drug candidates would be of value in early drug development. 2. in this study, a chimeric (upa+/+)/scid mouse model was evaluated with three structurally distinct compounds (gw695634, a benzophenone, sb-406725, a tetrahydroisoquinoline and gw823093, a fluoropyrrolidine) for which human metabolism and disposition was characterized. human metabolite profiles in plasma and/or urine were compared to those of chimeric (upa+/+)/scid and control cd-1 or (upa+/+)/scid) mice. gw695634 and sb-406725 exhibited primarily hepatic metabolism and were chosen as probes to assess which human metabolites would likely circulate systemically. gw823093 exhibited a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism such that renal excretion of drug-related material was similar to 2-fold greater in humans than in mice, and thus chosen as a probe to assess if the chimeric (upa+/+)/scid mouse would predict the urinary excretion of human metabolites. 3. we observed that human metabolism and disposition was well represented for gw695634, somewhat represented for gw823093 and minimally represented for sb-406725. collectively, the results of this and other studies suggest that while limitations for prediction of human metabolism and disposition exist, humanized chimeric mouse models can potentially represent informative new tools in drug discovery and development.
polymerase_chain_reaction	microparasites play an important role in the demography, ecology and evolution of pacific salmonids. as salmon stocks continue to decline and the impacts of global climate change on fish populations become apparent, a greater understanding of microparasites in wild salmon populations is warranted. we used high-throughput, quantitative pcr (ht-qrt-pcr) to rapidly screen 82 adult chinook salmon from five geographically or genetically distinct groups (mostly returning to tributaries of the fraser river) for 45 microparasite taxa. we detected 20 microparasite species, four of which have not previously been documented in chinook salmon, and four of which have not been previously detected in any salmonids in the fraser river. comparisons of microparasite load to blood plasma variables revealed some positive associations between flavobacterium psychrophilum, cryptobia salmositica and ceratonova shasta and physiological indices suggestive of morbidity. we include a comparison of our findings for each microparasite taxa with previous knowledge of its distribution in british columbia.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background. although trichinellosis is known to cause thrombotic disease, serious thrombotic events are rare and have not been previously associated with trichinella nativa infection. methods. patient interviews and medical chart reviews were conducted on 10 men who became ill following consumption of a common source of black bear meat. trichinella serology on patient sera as well as polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and larval identification of the meat samples was conducted. results. all 10 exposed individuals developed an acute illness clinically compatible with trichinellosis, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, along with eosinophilia ranging from 0.9 x 10(9)/l to 6.1 x 10(9)/l. within 2 weeks of the diarrheal illness, systemic symptoms developed in all exposed individuals characterized by fever, myalgia, periorbital edema, and fatigue. st-elevation myocardial infarction and sinus venous tract thrombosis occurred as a complication of trichinellosis in 2 patients. acute serology was nonreactive in all patients, though convalescent serology was reactive in 6 of 8 (75%) patients for whom sera was available. multiplex pcr identified t. nativa from the bear meat, and was corroborated by microscopic larval identification. conclusions. we report a 100% attack rate of t. nativa from bear meat among those who were exposed, and demonstrate that this species can cause serious thrombotic complications of trichinellosis in humans. education of hunters and the public regarding the importance of proper preparation of wild game prior to ingestion is warranted.
polymerase_chain_reaction	fusarium wilts of strawberry, caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, is a serious soil-borne disease. fusarium wilt causes dramatic yield losses in commercial strawberry production and it is a very stubborn disease to control. reliable chemical control of strawberry fusarium wilt disease is not yet available. moreover, other well-known f. oxysporum have different genetic information from f. oxysporum f.. sp. fragariae. this analysis investigates the genetic diversity of strawberry fusairum wilt pathogen. in total, 110 pathogens were isolated from three major strawberry production regions, namely sukok, hadong, sancheong in gyeongnam province in south korea. the isolates were confirmed using f. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae species-specific primer sets. polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analyses were executed using the internal transcribed spacer, intergenic spacer, translation elongation factorl-alpha, and beta-tubulin genes of the pathogens and four restriction enzymes: alui, hhai and hpy1i. regarding results, there were diverse patterns in the three gene regions except for the beta-tubulin gene region. correlation analysis of strawberry cultivation region, cultivation method, variety, and phenotype of isolated pathogen, confirmed that genetic diversity depended on the classification of the cultivated region.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the recommended screening of rabies in `suspect' animal cases involves testing fresh brain tissue. the preservation of fresh tissue however can be difficult under field conditions and formalin fixation provides a simple alternative that may allow a confirmatory diagnosis. the occurrence and location of histopathological changes and immunohistochemical (ihc) labelling for rabies in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (ffpe) canine brain is described in samples from 57 rabies suspect cases from sri-lanka. the presence of negri bodies and immunohistochemical detection of rabies virus antigen were evaluated in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brainstem. the effect of autolysis and artefactual degeneration of the tissue was also assessed. results: rabies was confirmed in 53 of 57 (93%) cases by ihc. ihc labelling was statistically more abundant in the brainstem. negri bodies were observed in 32 of 53 (60.4%) of the positive cases. although tissue degradation had no effect on ihc diagnosis, it was associated with an inability to detect negri bodies. in 13 cases, a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) testing for rabies virus rna was undertaken by extracting rna from fresh frozen tissue, and also attempted using ffpe samples. pcr detection using fresh frozen samples was in agreement with the ihc results. the pcr method from ffpe tissues was suitable for control material but unsuccessful in our field cases. conclusions: histopathological examination of the brain is essential to define the differential diagnoses of behaviour modifying conditions in rabies virus negative cases, but it is unreliable as the sole method for rabies diagnosis, particularly where artefactual change has occurred. formalin fixation and paraffin embedding does not prevent detection of rabies virus via ihc labelling even where artefactual degeneration has occurred. this could represent a pragmatic secondary assay for rabies diagnosis in the field because formalin fixation can prevent sample degeneration. the brain stem was shown to be the site with most viral immunoreactivity; supporting recommended sampling protocols in favour of improved necropsy safety in the field. pcr testing of formalin fixed tissue may be successful in certain circumstances as an alternative test.
polymerase_chain_reaction	watermelon (citrullus lanatus) is an important crop of the cucurbitaceae family in fruit production worldwide. during its production, bacterial fruit blotch (bfb) caused by acidovorax citrulli (acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli) is an important limiting factor on the volume and value of crops. this pathogen is known as a seed-borne pathogen, and the infested seeds can be a primary source of inoculum. hence, a rapid and sensitive method for detecting a. citrulli on seeds would be an important tool in the management of bfb. in this study, we sought to develop a method to detect a. citrulli bacterial cells based on a taqman probe-based insulated isothermal pcr (tiipcr) assay. firstly, the specific primers and probe were designed based on a specific dna fragment from the genome of a. citrulli. then, pcr amplification was performed with the plasmid dna to adjust the components of the pcr reagents, such as the concentrations of primers, magnesium chloride, and taq dna polymerase. results revealed that 10 copies of plasmid dna were detectable within the modified reagents by tiipcr. moreover, 10 bacterial cells in each reaction tube were detectable at a 100 % detection rate in this condition with a fluorescent signal intensification over 1.8. based on these results, we concluded that a specific, rapid, and sensitive method based on tiipcr had been successfully developed to detect bacterial cells of a. citrulli.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose. diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision loss. previous studies have shown signaling pathways mediated by stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) play a primary role in diabetic retinopathy progression. this study tested clt-005, a small molecule inhibitor of stat3, for its dose-dependent therapeutic effects on vision loss in a rat model of diabetic retinopathy. methods. brown norway rats were administered streptozotocin (stz) to induce diabetes. clt-005 was administered daily by oral gavage for 16 weeks at concentrations of 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg, respectively, beginning 4 days post streptozotocin administration. systemic and ocular drug concentration was quantified with mass spectrometry. visual function was monitored at 2-week intervals from 6 to 16 weeks using optokinetic tracking to measure visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. the presence and severity of cataracts was visually monitored and correlated to visual acuity. the transcription and translation of multiple angiogenic factors and inflammatory cytokines were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and multiplex immunoassay. results. streptozotocin-diabetic rats sustain progressive vision loss over 16 weeks, and this loss in visual function is rescued in a dose-dependent manner by clt-005. this positive therapeutic effect correlates to the positive effects of clt-005 on vascular leakage and the presence of inflammatory cytokines in the retina. conclusions. the present study indicates that stat3 inhibition has strong therapeutic potential for the treatment of vision loss in diabetic retinopathy.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aimthe primary aim of this study was to evaluate 23 pathogens associated with peri-implantitis at inner part of implant connections, in peri-implant and periodontal pockets between patients suffering peri-implantitis and participants with healthy peri-implant tissues; the secondary aim was to estimate the predictive value of microbiological profile in patients wearing dental implants using data mining methods. material and methodsfifty participants included in the present casecontrol study were scheduled for collection of plaque samples from the peri-implant pockets, internal connection, and periodontal pocket. real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify 23 pathogens. three predictive models were developed using c4.5 decision trees to estimate the predictive value of microbiological profile between three experimental sites. resultsthe final sample included 47 patients (22 healthy controls and 25 diseased cases), 90 implants (43 with healthy peri-implant tissues and 47 affected by peri-implantitis). total and mean pathogen counts at inner portions of the implant connection, in peri-implant and periodontal pockets were generally increased in peri-implantitis patients when compared to healthy controls. the inner portion of the implant connection, the periodontal pocket and peri-implant pocket, respectively, presented a predictive value of microbiologic profile of 82.78%, 94.31%, and 97.5% of accuracy. conclusionthis study showed that microbiological profile at all three experimental sites is differently characterized between patients suffering peri-implantitis and healthy controls. data mining analysis identified parvimonas micra as a highly accurate predictor of peri-implantitis when present in peri-implant pocket while this method generally seems to be promising for diagnosis of such complex infections.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: ras-related protein 25 (rab25) functions either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor with a cancer type-dependent manner. we aimed to investigate clinical significance of rab25 in prostate cancer (pca). methods: quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot and immunohistochemistry were respectively performed to detect rab25 mrna and protein expression in pca and adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues. receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate predictive diagnostic value of rab25. associations of rab25 expression with various clinicopathological characteristics and biochemical recurrence-free survival of pca patients were statistically evaluated. in vitro, pca cell proliferation was assessed by cck-8 assay, and the cell migration and invasion activities were evaluated by transwell assay, following the transfection of rab25 small interfering rna. results: ras-related protein 25 mrna and protein expression in pca tissues were both significantly higher than adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues (both p < 0.001). the area under the curve of rab25 immunoreactive score (irs) was 0.896 (p < 0.001) with 74.0% sensitivity and 95.0% specificity. high rab25 irs was significantly associated with high gleason score (p = 0.02) and distant metastasis (p = 0.01). pca patients with high rab25 irs had shorter overall and biochemical recurrence-free survivals than those with low rab25 irs (both p < 0.001). cox regression analysis identified rab25 as an independent biomarker for both overall and biochemical recurrence-free survivals of pca patients. by exploring its activities in vitro, rab25 downregulation was found to inhibit pca cell proliferation, migration and invasion. conclusions: high expression of rab25 may contribute to malignant progression and biochemical recurrence of pca patients after radical prostatectomy.
polymerase_chain_reaction	bifenthrin (bf) is a chiral pesticide with two enantiomers. in this work, its stereoselective degradation was investigated in plants and domesticated active sludge. considering that the degradation to pesticides of plants was effected by external conditions, hence, nanometer materials (gothite) were added into soil to explore the effect of sorption on enantioselectivity in degradation of bf. the microbial community that was responsible for bf-biodegrading in active sludge was studied by polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). in plant researches, chiral difference was discovered in the degradation of pesticides that onions resulted in. the existence of gothite in soil not only reduced the amount of bf that plants uptake from the environment, but it also enlarged the chiral difference during the process, indicating that the absorption of gothite to pesticides had enantioselectivity, which may be generated by that adsorption site where bf combined with gothite located in the chiral center of the pesticide. in studies of sludge, bf can be effectively degraded and decline of both isomers followed first-order kinetics. however, there was no obvious stereoselective degradation in domesticated sludge. the analysis of dgge revealed that active sludge maintained the rich microbial community in the whole process (h >3). the h index increased in the early domestication, which may because bf had no direct toxicity to the bacteria. the bacteria were able to degrade the small dose of the pesticide and absorbed it as nutrition. the sequence results demonstrated that the variety of bacteria grew, instead of acidobacteria, betaproteobacteria, sphingobacteriia and alphaproteobacteria, flavobacteria also appearing in sludge after domestication.
polymerase_chain_reaction	previous research focusing on rodent cells and animal models has demonstrated that gremlin-1 antagonizes bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps) in order to suppress osteogenesis. however, the impact of gremlin-1 on osteogenesis in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) remains unknown. the aim of the present study was to test the effects of gremlin-1 on viability and invitro bmp-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mscs). gremlin-1-specific small interfering rna (sirna) inhibited gremlin-1 mrna and protein expression in human mscs. the mrna expression levels of osteoblastic genes were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and calcification and enzymatic alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity assessed the bmp-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of human mscs. the results indicated that gremlin-1 suppression significantly increased human msc metabolism and dna content. the expression levels of osteoblastic genes were also significantly increased by gremlin-1 inhibition. in the gremlin-1-inhibited group, enzymatic alp activity was significantly increased. in addition, due to bmp-2-inducing osteoblasts, gremlin-1 inhibition increased calcium deposits. the present study indicated that gremlin-1 inhibited the cell viability and osteogenic differentiation of human mscs and that the suppression of gremlin-1 expression suppressed can increase the cell viability and osteogenic differentiation of human mscs induced by bmp-2.
immunology	objectives acute pancreatitis is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response. we hypothesized that the fundamental inflammatory response observed during the initial stages of all acute pancreatitis is not a th1 but rather a th17 response. methods seven patients with mild ap presenting within three days of symptom onset were recruited. peripheral blood was drawn for five consecutive days and plasma th1/th2/th17 cytokine levels compared to eleven healthy controls. plasma cytokine measurements were performed using th1/ th2/th17 cytokine bead array assay and data quantified using fcap array software. results il-6 levels were significantly elevated in ap patients compared to controls; il-10 levels were significantly elevated by day 3; il17a levels increased on day 2 and significantly elevated at day 3 compared to controls declining to non-significant levels by day 4. ifn gamma and tnf alpha levels were low at all time-points. conclusion il-17a and il-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine implicated in suppressing th17 cytokines secreted by macrophages and t cells) were elevated by day 3. in addition il-6, which helps drive development of th17 cells, was significantly elevated at all time-points. these preliminary results imply that the underlying ap induced systemic inflammation is polarized to a th17 rather than a th1 response.
immunology	a broad spectrum of autoimmunity is now well described in patients with primary immunodeficiencies (pids). management of autoimmune disease in the background of pid is particularly challenging given the seemingly discordant goals of immune support and immune suppression. our growing ability to define the molecular underpinnings of immune dysregulation has facilitated novel targeted therapeutics. this review focuses on mechanism-based treatment strategies for the most common autoimmune and inflammatory complications of pid including autoimmune cytopenias, rheumatologic disease, and gastrointestinal disease. we aim to provide guidance regarding the rational use of these agents in the complex pid patient population.

immunology	non-tuberculous mycobacteria (ntm) are not only emerging and opportunistic pathogens of both humans and animals, but from a veterinary point of view some species induce cross-reactive immune responses that hamper the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis (btb) in both livestock and wildlife. little information is available about ntm species circulating in wildlife species of south africa. in this study, we determined the diversity of ntm isolated from wildlife species from south africa as well as botswana. thirty known ntm species and subspecies, as well as unidentified ntm, and ntm closely related to mycobacterium goodii/mycobacterium smegmatis were identified from 102 isolates cultured between the years 1998 and 2010, using a combination of molecular assays viz pcr and sequencing of different mycobacterial house-keeping genes as well as single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) analysis. the ntm identified in this study include the following species which were isolated from tissue with tuberculosis-like lesions in the absence of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (mtbc) implying their potential role as pathogens of animals: mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii, mycobacterium gastri, mycobacterium species closely related to mycobacterium goodii/mycobacteriurn smegmatis, mycobacterium brasiliensis, mycobacterium sinense jmd 601, mycobacterium avium subsp. avium, mycobacterium sp. gr-2007, mycobacterium bouchedurhonense, and mycobacterium septicum/m. peregrinum. mycobaterium brasiliensis, mycobacterium gastri, mycobacterium sp. gr-2007, and a potential novel mycobacterium species closely related to mycobacterium goodii were found for the first time in this study to be potential pathogens of animals. mycobacterium simiae was isolated from a sample originating from a tuberculin skin test positive reactor, demonstrating its potential to elicit inappropriate immune responses in animals that may interfere with diagnosis of tuberculosis by immunology. mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletti was the most frequently detected ntm identified in 37 of the 102 isolates. other ntm species were also isolated from animals not showing any pathological changes. knowledge gained in this study contribute to the understanding of ntm species circulating in wild animals in south africa and the pathogenic potential of certain species, whose role in disease causation need to be examined, as well as to a certain extent the potential of m. simiae to hamper the diagnosis of btb.
immunology	immunocompromised patients have increased susceptibility to vaccine-preventable infections. thus, vaccination is a critical issue in this population. vaccines are usually classified as live versus inactivated or subunit (nonviable) vaccines. in general, inactivated vaccines are safe in immunocompromised patients and should be given per the routine schedule except when they are unlikely to have any benefit as in severe antibody deficiency or combined immunodeficient patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or immunoglobulin replacement. however, viable vaccines usually carry the risk of causing disease, especially in severely immunocompromised patients. therefore, much greater caution must be exercised with the use of viable vaccines and administration is individualized on the basis of the estimated risk of infections if not vaccinated versus the potential adverse effects of the vaccine itself. in this review, we make clear recommendations on the basis of available evidence regarding both routine and specialized vaccines, viable and nonviable, and the degree of immune compromise in all the categories of immunodeficiency disorders.

immunology	moyamoya disease is a chronic cerebrovascular occlusive disease that is characterized by progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its main branches. the occurrence of moyamoya disease is related to immune, genetic, and other factors. though the research of moyamoya disease has made great strides in the past 60 years, the etiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown. this review will focus on the genetic pathogenic and inflammation factors of moyamoya disease.
immunology	background: growing evidence emphasizes the relevance of sphingolipids for metabolism and immunity of antigen-presenting cells (apc). apcs are key players in balancing tolerogenic and encephalitogenic responses in immunology. in contrast to the well-known prominent effects of sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) on lymphocyte trafficking, modulatory effects on apcs have not been fully characterized. methods: frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cell (dc) subtypes, monocytes, and t cell subsets in 35 multiple sclerosis (ms) patients were evaluated prior and after undergoing fingolimod treatment for up to 24 months. impact of fingolimod and s1p on maturation and activation profile, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and phagocytotic capacity was assessed in vitro and ex vivo. modulation of dc-dependent programming of naive cd4+ t cells, as well as cd4+ and cd8+ t cell proliferation, was also investigated in vitro and ex vivo. results: fingolimod increased peripheral slandc count-cd1+ dc, and monocyte frequencies remained stable. while cd4+ t cell count decreased, ratio of treg/th17 significantly increased in fingolimod-treated patients over time. cd83, cd150, and hladr were all inhibited, but cd86 was upregulated in dcs after incubation in the presence of fingolimod. fingolimod but not s1p was associated with reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from dcs and monocytes in vitro and ex vivo. fingolimod also inhibited phagocytic capacity of slandcs and monocytes. after fingolimod, slandcs demonstrated reduced potential to induce interferon-gamma-expressing th1 or il-17-expressing th17 cells and dc-dependent t cell proliferation in vitro and in fingolimod-treated patients. conclusions: we present the first evidence that s1p-directed therapies can act additionally as immunomodulators that decrease the pro-inflammatory capabilities of apcs, which is a crucial element in dc-dependent t cell activation and programming.
immunology	patients with b-cell hematologic malignancies who progress through first-or second-line chemotherapy have a poor prognosis. early clinical trials with autologous anti-cd19 chimeric antigen receptor (car) t cells have demonstrated promising results for patients who have relapsed or refractory disease. lymphodepleting conditioning regimens, including cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, pentostatin, bendamustine, interleukin-2, and total body irradiation, are often administered before the infusion of car t cells, allowing for greater t-cell expansion. the major toxicity associated with car t-cell infusions is cytokine release syndrome (crs), a potentially life-threatening systemic inflammatory disorder. the quick onset and progression of crs require rapid detection and intervention to reduce treatment-related mortality. management with tocilizumab can help ameliorate the symptoms of severe crs, allowing steroids, which diminish the expansion and persistence of car t cells, to be reserved for tocilizumab-refractory patients. other toxicities of car t-cell therapy include neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia, infection, tumor lysis syndrome, neurotoxicity and nausea/vomiting. a review of patients' medications is imperative to eliminate medications that may contribute to treatment-related toxicities. studies are ongoing to help optimize patient selection, preparation, safety, and management of individuals receiving car t cells. long-term follow-up will help establish the place of car t cells in therapy.
immunology	urothelial bladder cancer is one of the first cancers recognized to be immunogenic since 40 years ago when the use of bacillus calmette guerin was shown to prevent recurrence. since that time, our knowledge of immune biology of cancer has expanded tremendously, and patients with bladder cancer finally have new active immunotherapeutic drugs on the horizon. anti-programmed cell death-1 (pd-1)/ programmed cell death ligand-1 (pd-l1) therapy has shown impressively durable responses in urothelial bladder cancer (ubc), but the reported response rates warrant improvement. to outline potential strategies to overcome tumor immune resistance, herein, we summarize current models of tumor immunology with a specific focus on bladder cancer. recognition of tumor-specific antigens through cross presentation, t-cell priming and activation, and trafficking of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment are some of the critical steps we now understand to be necessary for an effective antitumor immune response. many of the involved steps are important targets for therapeutic interventions. as new immunotherapies are developed, predictive biomarkers would also be important to select patients most likely to respond and to better understand tumor biology. several potential biomarkers are reviewed including pd-l1 expression, identification of t-cell-inflamed/non t-cell-inflamed tumors based on immune gene expression, intrinsic molecular subtyping based on luminalthasal or the cancer genome atlas (tcga) groups, t-cell receptor sequencing, and somatic mutational density. even within the past few years, our current knowledge of immune biology has exploded, and we are highly optimistic about the future of ubc therapy that will be available to patients.

immunology	the chronic inflammation plays an important role in heart failure and complement components might be useful markers of the prognosis. we set out to evaluate their predictive value in the clinical outcomes of patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt). we determined the complement levels c3, c3a, sc5b-9 and also the n-terminus of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) of 126 heart failure patients in a prospective, single-center observational study before and 6 months after crt implantation. crt reduced the c3a [212.5 (148.2-283.6) vs. 153 (119.8-218.3) ng/ml, p165 ng/ml hazard ratio = 4.21 (1.65-10.72), p = 0.003] independent of the nt-probnp and other factors. after reclassification, we observed a significant net reclassification improvement [nri = 0.71 (0.43-0.98), p < 0.0001] and integrated discrimination improvement [idi = 0.08 (0.03-0.12), p = 0.0002]. in patients with crt, elevated c3a levels increase the risk of mortality independent of the nt-probnp levels or other factors. crt exerts anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the complement activation.
immunology	stem cell therapy is a promising approach to the treatment of ischemic heart disease via replenishing cell loss after myocardial infarction. both preclinical studies and clinical trials have indicated that cardiac function improved consistently, but very modestly after cell-based therapy. this mainly attributed to low cell survival rate, engraftment and functional integration, which became the major challenges to regenerative medicine. in recent years, several new cell types have been developed to regenerate cardiomyocytes and novel delivery approaches helped to increase local cell retention. new strategies, such as cell pretreatment, gene-based therapy, tissue engineering, extracellular vesicles application and immunologic regulation, have surged and brought about improved cell survival and functional integration leading to better therapeutic effects after cell transplantation. in this review, we summarize these new strategies targeting at challenges of cardiac regenerative medicine and discuss recent evidences that may hint their effectiveness in the future clinical settings.
genetics	the parasitic weed, striga gesnerioides, is a major threat to cowpea productivity throughout the savannas of west and central africa. the identification of sources of s. gesnerioides resistance and their incorporation into breeding programs would be a beneficial strategy to combat the devastation caused by the parasite in cowpea fields. in this study we examined one hundred and ninety-four (194) accessions, four commercial varieties and two controls collected from a mini core collection of cowpea held at the international institute of tropical agriculture genebank for resistance to s. gesnerioides race 3 (sg3), the most prevalent race in nigeria, using phenotypic screening and molecular marker analysis. our studies identified two cowpea accessions, tvu-1272 and tvu-16514, that are resistant to s. gesnerioides sg3. resistance in these lines is associated with the molecular marker ssr1, known to segregate with the gene conferring resistance to sg3 in the cultivar b301. phenotypically, resistance in tvu-1272 and tvu-16514 is expressed as a hypersensitive response at the site of infection on the roots. allelism tests indicated that the gene that conferring sg3 resistance in tvu-1272 is independent of that conferring resistance in b301. tvu-1272 and tvu-16514 will provide additional new sources of resistance to striga and races prevalent in nigeria.
genetics	platelet activation in response to stimulation of the protease activated receptor 4 (par4) receptor differs by race. one factor that contributes to this difference is the expression level of phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (pctp), a regulator of platelet par4 function. we have conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eqtl) analysis that identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) linked to the expression level of platelet genes. this analysis revealed 26 snps associated with the expression level of pctp at genome-wide significance (p < 5x10-8). using annotation from encode and other public data we prioritised one of these snps, rs2912553, for functional testing. the allelic frequency of rs2912553 is racially-dimorphic, in concordance with the racially differential expression of pctp. reporter gene assays confirmed that the single nucleotide change caused by rs2912553 altered the transcriptional potency of the surrounding genomic locus. electromobility shift assays, luciferase assays, and overexpression studies indicated a role for the megakaryocytic transcription factor gata1. in summary, we have integrated multi-omic data to identify and functionalise an eqtl. this, along with the previously described relationship between pctp and par4 function, allows us to characterise a genotype- phenotype relationship through the mechanism of gene expression.
genetics	familial mediterranean fever (fmf) is caused by mutations within the mediterranean fever (mefv) gene. these gain of function mutations lead to an increased activation of the inflammasome pyrin with a subsequent disproportional proinflammatory reaction. classically, in fmf patients two pathogenic mutations affecting both alleles are found in the molecular genetic analysis; however, it is well known that the phenotype can also be caused either by mutations with lower penetrance or unknown significance. furthermore, in a significant number of patients only one or even no mefv mutations can be detected. heterozygous mutation carriers who do not suffer from classical fmf, can also present with other signs of inflammation, e. g. subclinical increased inflammation markers, associated inflammatory diseases or unclassified symptoms. thus, fmf does not follow a classical autosomal recessive inheritance and a variable gene dose effect has to be considered, which is furthermore modulated by other mostly unknown genetic variants and environmental factors. this article summarizes the broad spectrum of clinical presentations associated with mefv mutations and analyzes the effect of the gene dose on the phenotypical expression. furthermore, the impact of the molecular genetic analysis on the diagnostics of a patient and on the individualized management of the disease is discussed.
genetics	1. species coexistence requires differential response to inter-and intraspecific competition, typically conceptualized as niche differentiation. coexistence of close relatives therefore poses an interesting scenario with regards to niche differentiation since these species generally have many traits in common due to shared ancestry. native californian trifolium assemblages are locally diverse and represent a unique system for understanding competitive interactions among close relatives. 2. we conducted two similar greenhouse studies in which trifolium fucatum was grown alone, with a con-specific competitor, and with a congeneric competitor (trifolium macraei). in the first study, we assessed biomass production in t. fucatum, and in the second study we conducted an rnaseq analysis of t. fucatum roots to test for differentially expressed genes that may mediate competitive interactions and potentially coexistence. 3. compared to plants grown alone, competition (i.e. growth in the same pot) with a conspecific resulted in a greater reduction in biomass than competition with a congener, as predicted by theory. however, competition with a congener resulted in twice as many differentially expressed genes as competition with a conspecific. 4. annotations of identified genes differentiating congeneric from conspecific competition suggest several functions attributed to interactions with third-party organisms, including nodulation with rhizobial mutualists, and defence responses against pathogens and herbivores. in addition, salt-responsive genes and an iron transporter were differentially expressed in congeneric competition, and comparisons of sodium and iron concentrations in field soils where these species are found showed that t. fucatum occurs in higher sodium and iron microsites than t. macraei. thus, the transcriptome highlighted abiotic niche axes worth pursuing in future ecological experiments as potential mediators of coexistence. 5. we also found a subset of genes that responded similarly to both congeneric and conspecific competition in both direction and magnitude, indicating some conserved responses to competition, regardless of neighbour identity. 6. synthesis. transcriptomic analyses represent novel tools for identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions among species. working iteratively with ecological experimentation and observation, transcriptomes may allow us to identify novel dimensions of the n-dimensional niche that determine species' distributions and their ability to coexist.
genetics	standard neutral population genetics theory with a strictly fixed population size has important limitations. an alternative model that allows independently fluctuating population sizes and reproduces the standard neutral evolution is reviewed. we then study a situation such that the competing species are neutral at the equilibrium population size but population size fluctuations nevertheless favor fixation of one species over the other. in this case, a separation of timescales emerges naturally and allows adiabatic elimination of a fast population size variable to deduce the fluctuation-induced selection dynamics near the equilibrium population size. the results highlight the incompleteness of the standard population genetics with a strictly fixed population size.
genetics	more than a decade has passed since optics and genetics came together and lead to the emerging technologies of optogenetics. the advent of light-sensitive opsins made it possible to optically trigger the neurons into activation or inhibition by using visible light. the importance of spatiotemporally isolating a segment of a neural network and controlling nervous signaling in a precise manner has driven neuroscience researchers and engineers to invest great efforts in designing high precision in vivo implantable devices. these efforts have focused on delivery of sufficient power to deep brain regions, while monitoring neural activity with high resolution and fidelity. in this review, we report the progress made in the field of hybrid optoelectronic neural interfaces that combine optical stimulation with electrophysiological recordings. different approaches that incorporate optical or electrical components on implantable devices are discussed in detail. advantages of various different designs as well as practical and fundamental limitations are summarized to illuminate the future of neurotechnology development.
genetics	root resorption is a pathological process of multifactorial origin related to the permanent loss of dental root structure in response to a mechanical, inflammatory, autoimmune or infectious stimulus. external apical root resorption (earr) is a frequent clinical complication secondary to orthodontic tooth movement; apart from variables related to treatment, environmental factors and/or interindividual genetic variations can confer susceptibility or resistance to its occurrence. in this context, genetic predisposition has been described as an etiological factor, together with mechanical factors derived from orthodontic treatment. in recent years, international research groups have determined the degree of influence of some genetic biomarkers in defining increased/reduced susceptibility to postorthodontic earr. the influences of the il1 gene cluster (il1b, il1a, il1rn, il6), p2rx7, casp1, opg (tnfrsf11b), rank (tnfrsf11a), osteopontin (opn), tnf, the vitamin d receptor (taqi), tnsalp and irak1 have been analyzed. the objective of the present review study was to compile and analyze the latest information about the genetic background predisposing to earr during orthodontic treatment. genetics-based studies along with other basic science research in the field might help to clarify the exact nature of earr, the influence of genetic inheritance and possibly lead to the prevention or even eradication of this phenomenon during orthodontic treatment.
genetics	few reports of educational and counseling support resources exist for lynch syndrome (ls), a disorder requiring multi-organ cancer screening and specialized medical care throughout adult life. here we describe the development and efficacy of two resources designed to address this need, the memorial sloan kettering cancer center clinical genetics service annual lynch syndrome educational workshop (lsew), and a quarterly lynch syndrome patient advocacy network (lspan) support group. the lsew and lspan were implemented beginning in 2012. participant survey data evaluating satisfaction, clarity, and unmet needs for each event were retrospectively analyzed and summarized using descriptive statistics. annual lsew attendance ranged from 53 to 75 total participants. lsew year 1 participants indicated a need for a support group, and preferred in-person meetings at a frequency of every 3-6 months. for lsew year 2-5 participants, >96 % reported satisfaction with the lsew, and >82 % expressed interest in secure online support. common themes for improvement included increased time for question and answer sessions and additional introductory genetics education. responding lspan participants (n = 57 total survey responses in 11 meetings) found the meetings helpful (100 %), information clear (91 %), and presence of a genetic counselor useful (67 %). desired discussion topics included coping with stress and anxiety, development of a support network, family communication about ls, genetic testing decisions, and bereavement. following genetic counseling, a need exists for ongoing educational and emotional support in ls. implementation of resources such as the lsew and lspan is feasible and perceived as helpful by participants.
genetics	the same selective forces that give rise to rapid inter- and intraspecific divergence in snake venoms can also favor differences in venoms across life-history stages. ontogenetic changes in venom composition are well known and widespread in snakes but have not been investigated to the level of unambiguously identifying the specific loci involved. the eastern diamondback rattlesnake was previously shown to undergo an ontogenetic shift in venom composition at sexual maturity, and this shift accounted for more venom variation than (geography. to characterize the genetics underlying the ontogenetic venom compositional change in c. adamanteus, we sequenced adult/juvenile pairs of venom-gland transcriptomes from five populations previously shown to have different adult venom compositions. we identified a total of 59 putative toxin transcripts for c. adamanteus, and 12 of these were involved in the ontogenetic change. three toxins were downregulated, and nine were upregulated in adults relative to juveniles. adults and juveniles expressed similar total levels of snake-venom metalloproteinases but differed substantially in their featured paralogs, and adults expressed higher levels of bradykinin-potentiating and c-type natriuretic peptides, nerve growth factor, and specific paralogs of phospholipases a(2) and snake venom serine proteinases. juvenile venom was more toxic to mice, indicating that the expression differences resulted in a phenotypically, and therefore potentially ecologically, significant difference in venom function. we also showed that adult and juvenile venom-gland transcriptomes for a species with known ontogenetic venom variation were equally effective at individually providing a full characterization of the venom genes of a species but that any particular individual was likely to lack several toxins in their transcriptome. a full characterization of a species' venom-gene complement therefore requires sequencing more than one individual, although the ages of the individuals are unimportant.
genetics	the homygene19+14y system (hg19+14y) is a pcr-based amplification kit that enables typing of 18 autosomal short tandem repeat (str) loci (i.e., csf1po, d2s1338, d3s1358, d5s818, d6s1043, d7s820, d8s1179, d12s391, d13s317, d16s539, d18s51, d19s433, d21s11, fga, penta e, tpox, th01, vwa), 14 widely used y chromosome str (y-str) loci (y_gata_h4, dys385a/b, dys389i/ii, dys390, dys391, dys392, dys393, dys438, dys439, dys456, dys458, dys635), and amelogenin. this multiplex system was designed for the simultaneous analysis of amelogenin-yallele mutation, single-source searches, kinship (including familial searching), mixture profiles, international data sharing, and other forensic applications. in this study, the multiplex system was validated for sensitivity, specificity, dna mixtures, stability, precision, stutter, reproducibility, parallel tests, pcr-based conditions, and population analysis according to the scientific working group on dna analysis methods (swgdam) developmental validation guidelines. a total of 212 alleles were detected for the 18 autosomal str loci among 528 guangdong han individuals, and 431 haplotypes were found for 14 y-strs among 452 unrelated males. the combined match probability (cmp) of the hg19+14y system was calculated as 2.39 x 10(-29). all the validation results showed that the hg19+14y system would be a robust, reliable, highly polymorphic, and informative forensic kit.
cell_biology	the sebaceous gland is most commonly found in association with a hair follicle. its traditional function is the holocrine production of sebum, a complex mixture of lipids, cell debris, and other rather poorly characterized substances. due to the gland 's central role in acne pathogenesis, early research had focused on its lipogenic activity. less studied aspects of the sebaceous gland, such as stem cell biology, the regulation of cellular differentiation by transcription factors, the significance of specific lipid fractions, the endocrine and specially the neuroendocrine role of the sebaceous gland, and its contribution to the innate immunity, the detoxification of the skin, and skin aging have only recently attracted the attention of researchers from different disciplines. here, we summarize recent multidisciplinary progress in sebaceous gland research and discuss how sebaceous gland research may stimulate the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific molecular pathways of the pathogenesis of skin diseases.
cell_biology	the anaphylatoxin c5a constitutes a powerful fragment generated by complement system activation. interestingly, this complement active fragment is also an important mediator of tissue regeneration. recent findings suggest that c5a could be an initial signal orchestrating pulp nerve sprouting beneath carious injury, a critical step in dentin-pulp regeneration. indeed, the expression and activation of the c5a active receptor (c5ar/cd88) by injured pulp fibroblasts controls the direction of neurite outgrowth toward carious injuries by modulating the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) by pulp fibroblasts. a second c5a receptor, c5l2, has also been cloned but has received much less attention because its interaction with the ligand induces no signaling. this work aims to investigate the role of c5l2 in pulp nerve regeneration in the secretion of bdnf by pulp fibroblasts under sites of carious injury. using fluorescence immunostaining on human tooth sections in vivo and on primary human pulp fibroblasts in vitro, the authors reveal that c5l2 and c5ar are co-expressed by pulp fibroblasts under lipoteichoic acid (lta) stimulation. moreover, silencing c5l2 significantly increases bdnf secretion by lta-stimulated pulp fibroblasts. finally, an analysis of the subcellular distribution of c5ar and c5l2 indicates that the negative regulation of bdnf secretion by c5l2 correlates with c5ar activation and its subsequent intracellular co-localization with c5l2. overall, the current study sheds light on the mechanism of pulp nerve regeneration by identifying c5l2 as a negative regulator of bdnf secretion by pulp fibroblasts under carious teeth. this knowledge significantly increases the understanding of the functional mechanism linking c5ar and c5l2 in pulp nerve regeneration, which may be useful in future dentin-pulp engineering strategies that target fibroblast c5l2 to induce pulp innervation.
cell_biology	the third 'stem cell niche' meeting, supported by the novo nordisk foundation, was held this year on may 22-26 and brought together 185 selected participants from 24 different countries to hillerod, denmark. diverse aspects of embryonic and adult stem cell biology were discussed, including their respective niches in ageing, disease and regeneration. many presentations focused on emerging technologies, including single-cell analysis, in vitro organogenesis and direct reprogramming. here, we summarize the data presented at this exciting and highly enjoyable meeting, where speakers as well as kitchen chefs were applauded at every session.
cell_biology	kiaa1377, of which there are few studies regarding cell biology and neurological diseases, has been found to be significantly amplified in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) with lymph node metastasis compared with escc without lymph node metastasis. this suggests that kiaa1377 may play a role in the lymph node metastasis of escc. there has, to the best of our knowledge, been no study performed to investigate the role of kiaa1377 in escc. in the present study, the expression of kiaa1377 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and its expression was statistically analyzed with clinicopathological parameters, using commercially obtained tissue arrays consisting of 86 cases of escc and 79 paired controls. kiaa1377 was knocked down ex vivo using transient transfection with specific small hairpin rna (shrna) vectors into escc te-1 and ec9706 cell lines whose endogenous kiaa1377 level was highest. the variation of proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, wound healing and transwell assay, respectively. it was found in vivo that kiaa1377 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and differentiation, and ex vivo that knockdown of kiaa1377 cannot significantly affect proliferation and mobility in the escc cell line te-1. overall, this is the first study suggesting that kiaa1377 may play a role in the lymph node micrometastasis of escc.
cell_biology	a comprehensive view of protein phosphorylation remains an unmet challenge in the field of cell biology. mass spectrometry based proteomics is one of the most promising approaches for identifying thousands of phosphorylation events in a single experiment, yet the full breadth of the phosphoproteome has yet to be elucidated. in this article, we examined the complementarity of two methods for phosphopeptide enrichment based on either titanium dioxide (tio2) enrichment or phosphorylation motif-specific immunoaffinity precipitation (iap) with four different antibodies. each method identified nearly 2000 phosphoproteins. however, distinct populations of phosphopeptides were observed. despite quantifying over 10 000 unique phosphorylation events using tio2 and over 3900 with iap, less than 5% of the sites were in common. agreeing with published literature, the ratio of ps:pt:py phosphorylation for the tio2-enriched data set approximated 90:10:< 1. in contrast, that ratio for the combined iap data, sets was 51:29:20. these differences not only suggest the complementarity between multiple enrichment methods but also emphasize their collective importance in obtaining a comprehensive view of the phosphoproteome.
cell_biology	the treatment of renal failure has changed little in decades. organ transplantation and dialysis continue to represent the only therapeutic options available. however, decades of fundamental research into the response of the kidney to acute injury and the processes driving progression to chronic kidney disease are beginning to open doors to new options. similarly, continued investigations into the cellular and molecular basis of normal kidney development, together with major advances in stem cell biology, are now delivering options in regenerative medicine not possible as recently as a decade ago. in this review, we will discuss advances in regenerative medicine as it may be applied to the kidney. this will cover cellular therapies focused on ameliorating injury and improving repair as well as advancements in the generation of new renal tissue from stem/progenitor cells.
cell_biology	background: multiple factors affect oral mucosal healing, such as the persistence of an inflammatory reaction. the present study evaluates effects of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, and il-8 on epithelial cells (ecs) and human gingival fibroblasts (gfs) in vitro. methods: gfs and ecs were seeded in 96-well plates (1 x 10(4) cells/well) in plain culture medium (dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium [dmem]) containing 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution and 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated for 24 hours. both cell lines were exposed for 24 hours to the following cytokines: 1) tnf-alpha (100 ng/ml); 2) il-1 beta (1 ng/ml); 3) il-6 (10 ng/ml); and 4) il-8 (10 ng/ml). all cytokines were diluted in serum-free dmem. control cultures were exposed only to serum-free dmem. effects of exposure to inflammatory cytokines were determined by means of: 1) apoptosis (anexin v); 2) cell migration (wound healing assay); 3) inflammatory cytokine synthesis (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). data were analyzed by kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney u tests (alpha = 0.05). results: increased apoptosis rates were noted when cells were exposed to inflammatory cytokines, except ecs exposed to il-1 beta. cell migration was negatively affected by all inflammatory cytokines for both cell lines. ecs and gfs exposed to il-6 and il-8 significantly increased synthesis of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. conclusions: demonstrated results indicate negative effects of tested inflammatory cytokines on ecs and gfs, inducing apoptosis and impairing cell migration. these results can justify delayed oral mucosa healing in the presence of inflammatory reaction.
cell_biology	sperm cells provide essential, if usually diminutive, ingredients to successful sexual reproduction. despite this conserved function, sperm competition and coevolution with female traits can drive spectacular morphological change in these cells. here, we characterize four repeated instances of convergent evolution of sperm gigantism in caenorhabditis nematodes using phylogenetic comparative methods on 26 species. species at the extreme end of the 50-fold range of sperm-cell volumes across the genus have sperm capable of comprising up to 5% of egg-cell volume, representing severe attenuation of the magnitude of anisogamy. furthermore, we uncover significant differences in mean and variance of sperm size among genotypes, between sexes, and within and between individuals of identical genotypes. we demonstrate that the developmental basis of sperm size variation, both within and between species, becomes established during an early stage of sperm development at the formation of primary spermatocytes, while subsequent meiotic divisions contribute little further sperm size variability. these findings provide first insights into the developmental determinants of inter- and intraspecific sperm size differences in caenorhabditis. we hypothesize that life history and ecological differences among species favored the evolution of alternative sperm competition strategies toward either many smaller sperm or fewer larger sperm.
cell_biology	purpose: the major problem in producing artificial livers is that primary hepatocytes cannot be cultured for many days. recently, 3-dimensional (3d) printing technology draws attention and this technology regarded as a useful tool for current cell biology. by using the 3d bio-printing, these problems can be resolved. methods: to generate 3d bio-printed structures (25 mm x 25 mm), cells-alginate constructs were fabricated by 3d bio-printing system. mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of 6-8 weeks old mice by a 2-step collagenase method. samples of 4 x 10(7) hepatocytes with 80%-90% viability were printed with 3% alginate solution, and cultured with well-defined culture medium for primary hepatocytes. to confirm functional ability of hepatocytes cultured on 3d alginate scaffold, we conducted quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence with hepatic marker genes. results: isolated primary hepatocytes were printed with alginate. the 3d printed hepatocytes remained alive for 14 days. gene expression levels of albumin, hnf-4 alpha and foxa3 were gradually increased in the 3d structures. immunofluorescence analysis showed that the primary hepatocytes produced hepatic-specific proteins over the same period of time. conclusion: our research indicates that 3d bio-printing technique can be used for long-term culture of primary hepatocytes. it can therefore be used for drug screening and as a potential method of producing artificial livers.
cell_biology	during development, neural crest (nc) cells are induced by signaling events at the neural plate border of all vertebrate embryos. initially arising within the central nervous system, nc cells subsequently undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition to migrate into the periphery, where they differentiate into diverse cell types. here we provide evidence that postnatal human epidermal keratinocytes (kc), in response to fibroblast growth factor 2 and insulin like growth factor 1 signals, can be reprogrammed toward a nc fate. genome-wide transcriptome analyses show that keratinocyte-derived nc cells are similar to those derived from human embryonic stem cells. moreover, they give rise in vitro and in vivo to nc derivatives such as peripheral neurons, melanocytes, schwann cells and mesenchymal cells (osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and smooth muscle cells). by demonstrating that human keratin-14+ kc can form nc cells, even from clones of single cells, our results have important implications in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. stem cells2017;35:1402-1415
