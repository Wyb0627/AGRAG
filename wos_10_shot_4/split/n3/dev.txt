prenatal_development	the transcription factor c-myb is involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. as these processes accompany the morphogenesis of developing teeth, this work investigates the possible role of c-myb during odontogenesis. analysis of the expression of c-myb in the monophyodont mouse was followed by similar analysis in a diphyodont species, the pig, which has a dentition more closely resembling that of the human. the distribution of c-myb was correlated with the pattern of proliferation and apoptosis and the tooth phenotype of c-myb mutant mice was also assessed. in the mouse, c-myb expression was detected throughout prenatal development of the first molar tooth. negative temporospatial correlation was found between c-myb expression and apoptosis, while c-myb expression positively correlated with proliferation. c-myb-positive cells, however, were more abundant than the proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells, suggesting other roles of c-myb in odontogenesis. in the minipig, in contrast to the mouse, there was an asymmetrical arrangement of c-myb positive cells, with a higher presence on the labial side of the tooth germ and dental lamina. a cluster of negative cells was situated in the mesenchyme close to the tooth bud. at later stages, the number of positive cells decreased and these cells were situated in the upper part of the dental papilla in the areas of future cusp formation. the expression of c-myb in both species was strong in the odontoblasts and ameloblasts at the stage of dentin and enamel production suggesting a possible novel role of c-myb during tooth mineralization.
prenatal_development	people who were small at birth and had poor infant growth have an increased risk of adult cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and type 2 diabetes, particularly if their restricted early growth was followed by increased childhood weight gain. these relations extend across the normal range of birth size in a graded manner, so reduced size is not a prerequisite. in addition, larger birth size is associated with risks of obesity and type 2 diabetes. the associations appear to reflect developmental plastic responses made by the fetus and infant based on cues about the environment, influenced by maternal characteristics including diet, body composition, stress, and exercise levels. these responses involve epigenetic processes that modify the offspring 's phenotype. vulnerability to ill health results if the environment in infancy, childhood, and later life is mismatched to the phenotype induced in development, informed by the developmental cues. this mismatch may arise through unbalanced diet or body composition of the mother or a change in lifestyle factors between generations. these insights offer new possibilities for the early diagnosis and prevention of chronic disease.
prenatal_development	moderate exposure to alcohol during development leads to subtle neurobiological and behavioral effects classified under the umbrella term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (fasds). alterations in social behaviors are a frequently observed consequence of maternal drinking, as children with fasds display inappropriate aggressive behaviors and altered responses to social cues. rodent models of fasds mimic the behavioral alterations seen in humans, with rats exposed to ethanol during development displaying increased aggressive behaviors, decreased social investigation, and altered play behavior. work from our laboratory has observed increased wrestling behavior in adult male rats following prenatal alcohol exposure (pae), and increased expression of glun2b-containing nmda receptors in the agranular insular cortex (aic). this study was undertaken to determine if ifenprodil, a glun2b preferring negative allosteric modulator, has a significant effect on social behaviors in pae rats. using a voluntary ethanol exposure paradigm, rat dams were allowed to drink a saccharin-sweetened solution of either 0% or 5% ethanol throughout gestation. offspring at 6-8 months of age were implanted with cannulae into aic. animals were isolated for 24 h before ifenprodil or vehicle was infused into aic, and after 15 min they were recorded in a social interaction chamber. ifenprodil treatment altered aspects of wrestling, social investigatory behaviors, and ultrasonic vocalizations in rats exposed to ethanol during development that were not observed in control animals. these data indicate that glun2b-containing nmda receptors in aic play a role in social behaviors and may underlie alterations in behavior and vocalizations observed in pae animals.

prenatal_development	equivalence classes were formed of the names (a), time periods (b), and characteristics (c) of three stages of prenatal development of the students in a classroom. the baseline relations for these classes (ab and cb) were established on a group basis by the students in a classroom through the use of ""feedback-enhanced clicker-training"". thereafter, class formation was tracked on an individual basis with a very quickly administered sorting test. classes emerged immediately for 84 % of 32 students in a single 75-minute class session. thus, many students showed the immediate formation of equivalence classes when training was done on a group basis with a feedback-enhanced form of clicker training, and a sorting test was used to track class formation. we also considered some likely mechanisms that could account for learning the baseline relations by individual participants during clicker training. finally, we considered the feasibility of using a clickers and sorting protocol to implement equivalence-based instruction.
prenatal_development	we determined retinoids liver content in male and female mice fetuses to study a possible sex difference during prenatal development, and to ascertain if vitamin a metabolism is similar in both sexes. the study was performed between developmental days e15-e19, and the fetuses were collected from two main groups: control (no manipulation) and vitamin a (administration of vitamin a on developmental day e14). each group was subdivided by sex and retinoids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the control group did not have any retinol in the liver of both sexes. fetuses from the vitamin a group began to accumulate retinol on day e16, until e19 and sexual dimorphism was exhibited. retinyl palmitate content in the control group showed sexual dimorphism on some developmental days, and in the vitamin a group these differences were more significant. in conclusion, our study showed sexual dimorphism in the retinoids liver content during mice development and evidences a sex difference in vitamin a metabolism, with different capacities to store and metabolize retinoids.
prenatal_development	aside from the well-known biologically active angiotensin ii, other biologically active angiotensins have been discovered, including angiotensin iv and angiotensin-(1-7). some years ago, we and others discovered that the mas proto-oncogene encodes a g protein-coupled receptor being essential for angiotensin-(1-7) signaling. mas is not only expressed in the periphery but also within the brain, e.g. in the dentate gyrus (dg) and the piriform cortex (pc). since the dg is capable of adult neurogenesis, we examined the impact of a deletion of mas upon adult neurogenesis. deletion of mas did not alter cell proliferation in the adult dg (as monitored with phosphohistone h3) and did not alter cell death (as monitored with activated caspase 3). however, mas deficiency resulted in an increase in the number of doublecortin (dcx) positive cells, indicating that lack of mas increases the number of this cell population. concerning the pc, it is discussed whether adult neurogenesis occurs under physiological conditions in this area. we could demonstrate that mas deficiency has an impact on cell division and on the population of dcx-positive cells within the pc. since mas is not expressed before birth within the brain, our data may suggest that adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neurogenesis occurring during prenatal development share several common mechanisms, but are, at least in part, differentially regulated. moreover, since deficiency for mas increases the numbers of dcx-positive young neurons, blockage of mas might be beneficial in stimulating neurogenesis in adults.

prenatal_development	at birth, all children are characterized by different values of body weight and body length, caused by both genetic factors and the conditions and characteristics of their prenatal development. it is important to investigate whether these differences expressed at birth, particularly those values that are below average, can be improved by implementing a six-month period of kinesiological activity during childhood. with this purpose, a research was conducted using a sample of 214 children, aged 6,13 +/- 1,04 decimal years (experimental group of 93 boys and 29 girls, control group of 43 boys and 49 girls), which was divided into two subsamples by using k-mean cluster analysis based on body weight and length of children at birth. the formed subsamples were defined by the average values of the applied variables as groups of children that were below average and above average, according to their development at birth. motor status of children was assessed by using a battery of 7 standard motor tests, and intellectual status by applying raven 's colored progressive matrices. quantitative effects of the applied kinesiological treatment were analyzed based on the initial and final status of young participants in the examined variables by using multivariate analysis of variance and covariance. qualitative differences were defined by results of factor analyses. it was established that there were no statistically significant differences in the variable space between boys and girls in the initial measurement, in relation to the experimental and the control group, so the sample was further treated as the overall sample of children. the effects of the experimental treatment have shown significant improvement of motor and intellectual functioning of children in the experimental group of children with below average and above average development at birth.
prenatal_development	gas-to-liquid (gtl) products are synthetic hydrocarbons produced from natural gas using a fischer-tropsch process. this process yields a synthetic crude oil that consists of saturated hydrocarbons, primarily linear alkanes, with increasing amounts of branched (methyl-groups) alkanes as the chains get longer. in addition, small amounts of cycloalkanes (branched cyclopentanes and cyclohexanes) may be formed as the polymerization reaction prolongs. this synthetic crude can subsequently be refined to a range of products very similar to petroleum refining. however, in contrast to their petroleum-derived analogs, gtl products are essentially free of unsaturated or aromatic constituents and also no sulfur-, oxygen-, or nitrogen-containing constituents are present.from a regulatory perspective, gtl products are new substances which require extensive testing to assess their hazardous properties. as a consequence, a wide range of gtl products, covering the entire portfolio of gtl products, have been tested over the past few years in a wide variety of toxicological studies, including reproductive and prenatal development toxicity studies. this review provides an overview of the hazardous properties of the various gtl products.in general, the data collected on gtl products provide strong proof that they exert minimal health effects. in addition, these data provide supporting evidence for what is known on the mechanisms of mammalian toxicology of their petroleum-derived analogs. in the few cases where adverse effects were found for the gtl substances, these were usually less severe than the adverse effects observed with their petroleum-derived analogs.
prenatal_development	the functional activity of the cerebral cortex depends on the number and type of neurons including synapses and transmitters. the wiring of the cerebral cortex is of high importance for its function. the prenatal development of this process is genetically controlled, but the environmental factors play an important role. the formed neural circuits and networks possess the ability of reorganization during the postnatal life formation of new synaptic contacts and elimination of some synapses. the epigenetic factor and social interactions produce changes on the synaptic level which play a role in learning capacity, memory and behaviour. the different areas in the lobes of cerebral cortex are responsible for a number of different functions motor and sensory functions, vision, auditory information, taste, olfaction, intellect, behaviour, emotions, creative thoughts, planning, language, recognition, orientation, and many others. the association areas take a large part of the cerebral cortex. the stimulation of brain by means of active verbal interaction with a child would develop the mental capacity. abnormalities in cerebral cortex were established in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. it is possible to build better brain in an adult by means of daily mind gym. mental and physical activity and intensive social contacts are necessary for the protection of the cerebral cortex in aged individuals. the brain plasticity, starting from the prenatal development till the end of life, must be taken into consideration.
prenatal_development	here we report the detection and distribution of synaptophysin (spy), non-neuronal enolase (nne), glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), vimentin (vim), neuropeptide y (npy), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) expression in the goat forestomach during prenatal development. a total of 140 embryos and fetuses were examined to evaluate protein expression from the first stage of prenatal life until birth. in all cases, spy immunoreactivity was detected at 53 days gestation in the lamina propria-submucosa, tunica muscularis, serosa, and myenteric plexuses. immunoreactivity to nne was observed at 64 days gestation in the same locations as well as the epithelial layer. glial cells were found at 64 days as indicated by signals corresponding to gfap and vim at 39 days. positive staining for npy and vip was observed at 113, 75, and 95 days in the rumen, reticulum, and omasum, respectively, in the lamina propria-submucosa, tunica muscularis, and myenteric plexuses of each of these gastric compartments. these findings indicate possible preparation of the fetal goat forestomach for postnatal function. compared to other ruminant species, neuroendocrine cells, glial cells and peptidergic innervations markers were detected earlier compared to sheep but at around the same stage as in deer.
attention	the pricing of options in the fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility model using the singular perturbation method has received a considerable amount of attention in the last two decades. however, it is not to easy to estimate the accuracy of the approximation if the payoff function is not smooth or bounded, as is the case for european call options. in this article, we introduce a new novel approach for pricing options in the fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility model. combinations of fourier analysis and singular perturbation methods enable us to estimate the accuracy easily. we also show that this method allows us to derive the price of european and bermudan options in the fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility environment with jumps.

attention	biotechnological production of fatty alcohols, important raw materials in the chemical industry, has been receiving considerable attention in recent years. fatty alcohols are formed by the reduction of fatty acyl-coas or fatty acyl-acps catalyzed by a fatty acyl reductase (far). in this study, we introduced genes encoding fars from arabidopsis thaliana (atfar5) and simmondsia chinensis (scfar) into crambe abyssinica hairy roots via agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. the efficiency of the transformation ranged between 30 and 45%. the fatty alcohols were only detected in the transgenic hairy root lines expressing scfar gene. in all tested lines stearyl alcohol (18:0-oh), arachidyl alcohol (20:0-oh), and behenyl alcohol (22:0-oh) were produced. the content of 18:0-oh varied from 1 to 3% of total fatty acids and fatty alcohols, while the amount of either 20:0-oh and 22:0-oh did not exceed 2%. the transgenic hairy root lines produced from 0.98 to 2.59nmol of fatty alcohols per mg of dry weight. very low activity of scfar was detected in the microsomal fractions isolated from the selected hairy root lines. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the fatty alcohol production in the hairy root cultures. biotechnol. bioeng. 2017;114: 1275-1282.

attention	with increasing demand for energy and advances in exploration and development technologies, more attention is being devoted to exploration and development of deep oil and gas reservoirs. the nanpu sag contains huge reserves in deep oil and gas reservoirs and is a promising area. in this paper, the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of hard brittle shales from the shahejie formation in the nanpu sag in the bohai bay basin of northern china were investigated using a variety of methods, including x-ray diffraction analysis, cation exchange capacity (cec) analysis, contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscope observations, immersion experiments, ultrasonic testing and mechanical testing. the effects of the physico-chemical properties of the shales on wellbore instability were observed, and the effects of hydration of the shales on wellbore instability were also examined. the results show that the major mineral constituents of the investigated shales are quartz and clay minerals. the clay mineral contents range from 25.33% to 52.03%, and the quartz contents range from 20.03% to 46.45%. the clay minerals do not include montmorillonite, but large amounts of mixed-layer illite/smectite were observed. the cec values of the shales range from 90 to 210 mmol kg(-1), indicating that the shales are partly hydrated. the wettability of the shales is strongly water-wetted, indicating that water would enter the shales due to the capillary effect. hydration of hard brittle shales can generate cracks, leading to changes in microstructure and increases in the acoustic value, which could generate damage in the shales and reduce their strength. with increasing hydration time, the shale hydration effect gradually becomes stronger, causing an increase in the range of the acoustic travel time and decreases in the ranges of cohesion and internal friction angles. for the hard brittle shales of the nanpu sag, drilling fluid systems should aim to enhance sealing ability, decrease drilling fluid filter loss and increase the amount of clay-hydration inhibitor used.
attention	an analysis is reported here for three-time level integration methods following the global spectral analysis (gsa) described in high accuracy computing methods, t.k. sengupta, cambridge univ. press, usa. the focus is on the second order adams-bashforth (ab2) and the extrapolation in time (ext2) methods. careful distinction is made for the first time step at t = 0 by either euler forward or four-stage, fourth order runge-kutta (rk4) time schemes. the latter is used to solve a benchmark aeroacoustic problem. several one-dimensional wave propagation models are analyzed: pure advection and advection-diffusion equations. various spatial discretizations are discussed, including fourier spectral method. attention is paid to the presence of physical and numerical modes as noted in the quadratic equation obtained from the difference equation for the model 1d convection equation. it is shown that ab2 method is less stable and accurate than ext2 method, with respect to numerical dissipation and dispersion. this is true for the methods, in which the physical mode dominates over the numerical mode. presented analysis provides useful guide to analyze any three-time level methods.

attention	branch and bound is a well-known generic method for computing an optimal solution of a single objective optimization problem. based on the idea ""divide to conquer"", it consists in an implicit enumeration principle viewed as a tree search. although the branch and bound was first suggested by land and doig (1960), the first complete algorithm introduced as a multi-objective branch and bound that we identified was proposed by kiziltan and yucaoglu (1983). rather few multi-objective branch and bound algorithms have been proposed. this situation is not surprising as the contributions on the extensions of the components of branch and bound for multi-objective optimization are recent. for example, the concept of bound sets, which extends the classic notion of bounds, has been mentioned by villarreal and karwan (1981). but it was only developed for the first time in 2001 by ehrgott and gandibleux, and fully defined in 2007. this paper describes a state-of-the-art of multi-objective branch and bound, which reviews concepts, components and published algorithms. it mainly focuses on the contributions belonging to the class of optimization problems who has received the most of attention in this context from 1983 until 2015: the linear optimization problems with zero-one variables and mixed 0-1/continuous variables. only papers aiming to compute a complete set of efficient solutions are discussed.

attention	the aim of this article is to systematically review the literature studying the association between television viewing and children 's executive function, academic performance, attention, language and play. using keywords: television, children, infants, attention, language, education and cognition, five online databases were searched. seventy-six studies that met all the inclusion criteria were reviewed. the findings suggest the relationship between television viewing and children 's development is complex. first, the likely effects of television may depend on children 's individual characteristics, family and social context. second, the features of television, such as content and editing pace, and the type of exposure (foreground or background) may affect outcomes. specifically, watching high-quality educational content during preschool years improves children 's basic academic skills and predicts subsequent positive academic performance. conversely, television viewing in infancy is disruptive to play; it reduces the quality and quantity of child-parent interactions and is associated with inattentive/hyperactive behaviours, lower executive functions, and language delay, at least in the short-term. it remains unclear whether these interactions between television and cognition are long lasting. future research should focus on the systematic investigation of the pathways that link particular components of television and the type of exposure with individual and contextual factors, to investigate their potential unique and combined effects on development. researchers must also address the challenge of investigating the diverse and rapidly changing technologies to which the current generation of children are exposed.(c) 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
attention	recently, determining the ramsey numbers of loose paths and cycles in uniform hyper graphs has received considerable attention. it has been shown that the 2-color ramsey number of a k-uniform loose cycle c-n(k), r(c-n(k), c-n(k)), is asymptotically 1/2(2k- 1)n. here we conjecture that for any n >= m >= 3 and k >= 3, r(p-n(k), p-m(k)) = r(p-n(k), c-m(k)) = r(c-n(k), c-m(k)) + 1 = (k-1)n + left perpendicular m+1/2 right perpendicular. recently the case k = 3 was proved by the authors. in this paper, first we show that this conjecture is true for k = 3 with a much shorter proof. then, we show that for fixed m >= 3 and k >= 4 the conjecture is equivalent to (only) the last equality for any 2m >= n >= in >= 3. finally we give a proof for the case m = 3.

attention	nitrobenzene (nb) is widely used in the manufacturing of different types of products and other aromatic chemicals. moreover, it is highly toxic and environmental pollutant compound. therefore, the detection of nitro aromatic compounds (nacs) has gained more attention in the field of sensor. this article describes the green reduction utilized to preparation of green reduced graphene oxide/nickel tetraphenyl porphyrin (grgo/ni-tpp) nanocomposite modified electrode for the determination of nitrobenzene (nb). the grgo was prepared by environmentally friendly method and using caffeic acid (ca) as a reducing agent. moreover, the grgo/ni-tpp nanocomposite was prepared via the pi-pi stacking interaction between the rgo and ni-tpp. in addition, the prepared material was confirmed by the uv-visible spectroscopy (uv), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir). the structural morphology and elemental composition of the prepared nanocomposite was confirmed by the scanning electron microscope (sem) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx). besides, the electrochemical studies of the prepared nanocomposite was characterized by the cv and dpv technique. the dpv studies displayed the linearity response of the proposed sensor about 0.5-878 mu m with the sensitivity of 1.277 mu a mu m-1 cm(-2) and the limit of detection (lod) is 0.14 mu m. furthermore, the grgo/ni-tpp nanocomposite modified electrode shows good selectivity towards the detection of nb. in addition, the real sample analysis exhibited appreciable recovery towards the determination of nb using various types of water samples.

eating_disorders	anorexia nervosa (an) is a serious psychiatric disorder with high morbidity and mortality. there are no established pharmacological treatments and the neurobiology of the condition is poorly understood. previous studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) have shown that an may be associated with reductions in indices of brain glutamate; however, at conventional field strengths (3 t), it is difficult to separate glutamate from its precursor and metabolite, glutamine. the objective of the present study was to use high field (7 t) mrs to measure concentrations of glutamate, in three separate brain voxels, in women with an. we studied 13 female participants with an and 12 healthy female controls who underwent mrs scanning at 7 t with voxels placed in anterior cingulate cortex, occipital cortex and putamen. neurometabolites were calculated using the unsuppressed water signal as a reference and corrected for individual cerebrospinal fluid concentration in the voxel. we found that participants with an had significantly lower concentrations of glutamate in all three voxels (mean reduction 8%, p = 0.002) but glutamine levels were not altered. concentrations of n-acetylaspartate, creatine, gaba and glutathione were also unchanged. however, inositol was lower in an participants in anterior cingulate (p = 0.022) and occipital cortex (p = 0.002). women with an apparently have widespread reductions in brain glutamate. further work will be needed to assess if this change has pathophysiological relevance or whether it is a consequence of the many physical changes produced in an by food restriction.
eating_disorders	aimalthough the female suicide rate in japan is one of the highest among oecd countries, little has been done to assess the psychosocial and psychiatric characteristics of japanese female suicide completers. this study aimed to examine sex differences in psychosocial and psychiatric characteristics of suicide completers using a psychological autopsy study method, and to identify female suicide factors and intervention points to prevent female suicides. methodsa semi-structured interview was conducted with close family members of adult suicide completers. the interview included questions regarding sociodemographic factors, suicide characteristics, previous suicidal behaviors and a family history of suicidal behaviors, financial problems, and physical/psychiatric problems. fisher 's exact test and the student 's t-test were used to explore sex differences in these survey items, and individual descriptive information of female suicide cases was also examined. resultsof the 92 suicide completers, 28 were female and 64 were male. females had a significantly higher prevalence of a history of self-harm/suicide attempts (p < 0.001). the prevalence of eating disorders was significantly higher among females than males (p < 0.01). conclusionthe findings of this study highlight the importance of providing psychological and social support to caregivers of those who repeatedly attempt suicide and express suicidal thoughts, and to suggest the need to improve community care systems to be aware of suicide risk factors among female suicide attempters.
eating_disorders	purpose: robust empirical evidence has illustrated a rising prevalence of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating among males, noting that both may be oriented more toward muscularitydas opposed to thinness-oriented concerns. while an elevated prevalence of premorbid anorexia nervosa (an) has been noted among those with muscle dysmorphia, little evidence has examined the process of this transition from thinness-oriented to muscularity-oriented disordered eating. methods: this clinical observation presents a case of an in an adolescent male, whose symptom presentation transitioned during the course of treatment for an, into more muscularity-oriented disordered eating. results: despite the core body image disturbance and disordered eating behaviors being retained, the behavioral expression of muscularity-oriented disordered eating was difficult to detect during treatment for an, and he was discharged from treatment as his muscularity-oriented disordered eating escalated. conclusions: transdiagnostic crossover between thinness-oriented and muscularity-oriented disordered eating represents an important clinical concern, which may be challenging to measure and assess. implications for treatment are discussed, and the early detection of muscularity-oriented disordered eating.

eating_disorders	adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends in early adulthood. most commonly, adolescence is divided into three developmental periods: early adolescence (10-14 years of age), late adolescence (15-19 years of age), and young adulthood (20-24 years of age). adolescence is marked by physical and sexual maturation, social and economic independence, development of identity, acquisition of skills needed to carry out adult relationships and roles, and the capacity for abstract reasoning. adolescence is characterized by a rapid pace of growth that is second only to that of infancy. nutrition and the adolescent transition are closely intertwined, since eating patterns and behaviors are influenced by many factors, including peer influences, parental modeling, food availability, food preferences, cost, convenience, personal and cultural beliefs, mass media, and body image. here, we describe the physiology, metabolism, and nutritional requirements for adolescents and pregnant adolescents, as well as nutrition-related behavior and current trends in adolescent nutrition. we conclude with thoughts on the implications for nutrition interventions and priority areas that would require further investigation.
eating_disorders	background: digital health interventions (dhis), including computer-assisted therapy, smartphone apps and wearable technologies, are heralded as having enormous potential to improve uptake and accessibility, efficiency, clinical effectiveness and personalisation of mental health interventions. it is generally assumed that dhis will be preferred by children and young people (cyp) given their ubiquitous digital activity. however, it remains uncertain whether: dhis for cyp are clinically and cost-effective, cyp prefer dhis to traditional services, dhis widen access and how they should be evaluated and adopted by mental health services. this review evaluates the evidence-base for dhis and considers the key research questions and approaches to evaluation and implementation. methods: we conducted a meta-review of scoping, narrative, systematic or meta-analytical reviews investigating the effectiveness of dhis for mental health problems in cyp. we also updated a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (rcts) of dhis for cyp published in the last 3 years. results: twenty-one reviews were included in the meta-review. the findings provide some support for the clinical benefit of dhis, particularly computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (ccbt), for depression and anxiety in adolescents and young adults. the systematic review identified 30 new rcts evaluating dhis for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd), autism, anxiety, depression, psychosis, eating disorders and ptsd. the benefits of dhis in managing adhd, autism, psychosis and eating disorders are uncertain, and evidence is lacking regarding the cost-effectiveness of dhis. conclusions: key methodological limitations make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from existing clinical trials of dhis. issues include variable uptake and engagement with dhis, lack of an agreed typology/taxonomy for dhis, small sample sizes, lack of blinded outcome assessment, combining different comparators, short-term follow-up and poor specification of the level of human support. research and practice recommendations are presented that address the key research questions and methodological issues for the evaluation and clinical implementation of dhis for cyp.
eating_disorders	this study investigated whether orthorexia nervosa (on; characterized by an obsessive fixation on eating healthy) may be predicted from the demographics variables of gender and bmi, and from the personality variables of self-esteem, narcissism, and perfectionism. participants were 459 college students, who completed several online questionnaires that assessed these variables. a principal components analysis confirmed that the eating habits questionnaire (gleaves, graham, & ambwani, 2013) assesses three internally-consistent on components: healthy eating behaviors, problems resulting from those behaviors, and positive feelings associated with those behaviors. a manova and its tests of between subjects effects then revealed significant interactions between gender and bmi, such that for men but not women, a higher bmi was associated with greater symptomatology for all on components. partial correlation analyses, after controlling for gender and bmi, revealed that both narcissism and perfectionism were positively correlated with all aspects of on symptomatology.

eating_disorders	objective: to compare hormonal and clinical responses to gnrh pulsatile treatment in weight-recovered anorexia nervosa patients (rec-an) with persistent functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (ha) vs. in patients with secondary and primary ha. design: retrospective, observational, ambulatory study. setting: university hospital. patient(s): forty-one women: 19 rec-an (body mass index >18.5 kg/m(2) without menses recovery), 15 secondary ha without any eating disorders patients (sha), and 7 primary ha patients (pha). intervention(s): gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulsatile therapy. main outcome measure(s): baseline e-2, lh, and p plasma levels and their changes during induction cycles; ovulation, follicular recruitment, and pregnancies. results: the rec-an group displayed higher basal e-2 and lh plasma levels after gnrh injection compared with sha and pha. higher e-2 and lh levels were observed during induction cycles in rec-an compared with sha and pha. follicular recruitment was higher in rec-an. the ovulation rate was higher in rec-an compared with pha but similar to sha. conclusion(s): this study showed increased gonadal status and higher e-2 response to pulsatile gnrh therapy in persistent amenorrheic weight-recovered an compared with ha from other causes. it suggests that their individual set-point of body weight allowing a fully functional gonadal axis is not reached yet. specific factors of gonadal inertia in rec-an still remain unclear.
eating_disorders	this article provides a narrative review of the relationships between several behavioural addictions [pathological gambling, problematic internet use (piu), problematic online gaming, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder, compulsive buying, and exercise addiction] and psychiatric disorders. associations between most behavioural addictions and depressive and anxiety disorders are strong and seem relatively non-specific. strong links with substance use disorders may support the notion that some people are more prone to addictive behaviours, regardless of whether these involve substances or problematic activities. other associations seem relatively specific, for example, those between piu/online gaming and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, between compulsive buying on the one hand and eating disorders and hoarding on the other hand and between exercise addiction and eating disorders. the quality of the research varies, but most studies suffer from methodological limitations, including a cross-sectional or correlational design, non-representative study populations, small sample sizes, reliance on self-report assessment instruments, diverse diagnostic criteria, and conceptual heterogeneity of most behavioural addictions. due to these limitations, generalisability of the findings is questionable and the direction of causality, if any, is unknown in the relationships between behavioural addictions and psychiatric disorders. regardless of the aetiological uncertainty, these relationships often call for a modified treatment approach. prospective studies are needed to clarify the longitudinal relationships between behavioural addictions and psychiatric disorders.
eating_disorders	objective: to objectively assess seated non-exercise physical activity in patients with anorexia nervosa (an) relative to healthy controls (hcs) and examine the associations between this physical activity, eating disorder pathology, and levels of anxiety and depression. method: eleven inpatients with an and 10 hcs wore a shoe-based accelerometer (smartshoe) at three time points: a) while eating lunch, b) filling out questionnaires, and c) watching television for 1 h. results: across all three tasks, patients with an were significantly more active than hcs, thereby engaging in a greater degree of restless or fidgeting behavior. degree of physical activity was positively correlated with eating disorder psychopathology in the sample with an, and a trend towards a positive association between physical activity and levels of depression and anxiety was also found in this sample. among individuals with an, physical activity was not significantly correlated with bmi, duration of illness, or number of days since hospital admission. discussion: use of a minimally invasive, shoe-based monitor revealed patients with an engaged in a greater degree of fidgeting relative to hcs during quiet, seated tasks and this heightened activity was related to measures of pathology. non-exercise physical activity, including fidgeting, may warrant further clinical attention in this patient population.

eating_disorders	the nation 's fight against fat has not reduced obesity, but it has had other worrying effects. mental health researchers have raised the possibility that the intense pressures to lose weight have heightened the risks of developing eating disorders, especially among the young. medical anthropology can help connect the dots between the war on fat and disordered eating, identifying specific mechanisms, pathways, and contextual forces that may lie beyond the scope of biomedical and psychiatric research. this article develops a biocitizenship approach that focuses on the pathologization of heaviness, the necessity of having a thin, fit body to belonging to the category of worthy citizen, and the work of pervasive fat-talk in defining who can belong. ethnographic narratives from california illuminate the dynamics in individual lives, while lending powerful support to the idea that the battle against fat is worsening disordered eating and eating disorders among vulnerable young people.
borderline_personality_disorder	objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of crisis response planning for the prevention of suicide attempts. method: randomized clinical trial of active duty army soldiers (n=97) at fort carson, colorado, presenting for an emergency behavioral health appointment. participants were randomly assigned to receive a contract for safety, a standard crisis response plan, or an enhanced crisis response plan. incidence of suicide attempts during follow-up was assessed with the suicide attempt self-injury interview. inclusion criteria were the presence of suicidal ideation during the past week and/or a lifetime history of suicide attempt. exclusion criteria were the presence of a medical condition that precluded informed consent (e.g., active psychosis, mania). survival curve analyses were used to determine efficacy on time to first suicide attempt. longitudinal mixed effects models were used to determine efficacy on severity of suicide ideation and follow-up mental health care utilization. results: from baseline to the 6-month follow-up, 3 participants receiving a crisis response plan (estimated proportion: 5%) and 5 participants receiving a contract for safety (estimated proportion: 19%) attempted suicide (log-rank chi(2)(1)=4.85, p=0.028; hazard ratio=0.24, 95% ci=0.06-0.96), suggesting a 76% reduction in suicide attempts. crisis response planning was associated with significantly faster decline in suicide ideation (f(3,195)=18.64, p < 0.001) and fewer inpatient hospitalization days (f(1,82)=7.41, p < 0.001). there were no differences between the enhanced and standard crisis response plan conditions. conclusion: crisis response planning was more effective than a contract for safety in preventing suicide attempts, resolving suicide ideation, and reducing inpatient hospitalization among high-risk active duty soldiers.
borderline_personality_disorder	borderline personality disorder (bpd) is a diagnosis defined by impairments in several dynamic processes (e.g., interpersonal relating, affect regulation, behavioral control). theories of bpd emphasize that these impairments appear in specific contexts, and emerging results confirm this view. at the same time, bpd is a complex construct that encompasses individuals with heterogeneous pathology. these featuresdynamic processes, situational specificity, and individual heterogeneitypose significant assessment challenges. in the current study, we demonstrate assessment and analytic methods that capture both between-person differences and within-person changes over time. twenty-five participants diagnosed with bpd completed event-contingent, ambulatory assessment protocols over 21 days. we used p-technique factor analyses to identify person-specific psychological structures consistent with clinical theories of personality. five exemplar cases are selected and presented in detail to showcase the potential utility of these methods. the presented cases' factor structures reflect not only heterogeneity but also suggest points of convergence. the factors also demonstrated significant associations with important clinical targets (self-harm, interpersonal violence).
borderline_personality_disorder	objectivesinterpersonal emotion regulation (er) plays a significant role in how individuals meet others' emotional needs and shape social interactions, as it is key to initiating and maintaining high-quality social relationships. given that individuals with borderline personality disorder (bpd) or asperger 's syndrome (as) exhibit problems in social interactions, the aim of this study was to examine their use of different interpersonal er strategies compared to normative control participants. methodsthirty individuals with as, 30 with bpd, and 60 age-, gender-, and education-matched control participants completed a battery of measures to assess interpersonal er, which assessed to what extent participants tended to engage in interpersonal affect improvement and worsening and to what extent they used different strategies. before completing those measures, all groups were screened for disorders of axis i and axis ii with the structured clinical interview for dsm-iv axis i and axis ii disorders. resultscompared to controls, individuals with as and with bpd engaged less in affect improvement. no differences were found for affect worsening. individuals with as reported to use less adaptive (attention deployment, cognitive change) and more maladaptive (expressive suppression) interpersonal er strategies, compared to individuals with bpd and control participants who did not differ from each other. conclusionsthe obtained results suggest the need to develop tailored er interventions for each of the clinical groups studied. furthermore, they highlight the need to study further potential differences in intrapersonal and interpersonal er in clinical populations. practitioner points individuals with asperger 's syndrome (as) and borderline personality disorder (bpd) engaged significantly less than healthy controls in interpersonal affect improvement. individuals with bpd did not differ from healthy controls in the use of interpersonal strategies. individuals with as reported to use more maladaptive and less adaptive strategies than bpd individuals and healthy controls. understanding differences in interpersonal emotion regulation in individuals with as and with bpd and normative controls might help practitioners develop better interventions.
borderline_personality_disorder	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is highly prevalent among adults with addictive disorders, but little is known about addiction patterns associated with adhd diagnosis. this study examined addiction severity in patients with co-occurring addictive disorders and adhd controlling for the potential influence of associated psychiatric comorbidity. data were collected in french outpatient addiction treatment centers. a total of 217 patients seeking treatment for substance or gambling addiction were included. at treatment entry, participants were interviewed with the addiction severity index, the conners adult adhd diagnosis interview for the dsm-iv (caadid), the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (mini) and the structured clinical interview for dsm-iv axis ii for borderline personality disorder (scid ii). history of adhd was associated with an earlier onset of addiction, poly-dependence (defined by presence of at least two current substance dependence diagnoses in addition to tobacco dependence if present) and borderline personality disorder. persistence of adhd during adulthood was associated with a higher prevalence of poly -dependence. this study highlights the need for early implementation of preventive interventions for substance use or behavioral addiction in children/adolescents with adhd and the need to consider adhd in the treatment of addictive disorders.
borderline_personality_disorder	emotion regulation has been examined extensively with regard to important outcomes, including psychological and physical health. however, the literature includes many different emotion regulation strategies but little examination of how they relate to one another, making it difficult to interpret and synthesize findings. the goal of this meta-analysis was to examine the underlying structure of common emotion regulation strategies (i.e., acceptance, behavioral avoidance, distraction, experiential avoidance, expressive suppression, mindfulness, problem solving, reappraisal, rumination, worry), and to evaluate this structure in light of theoretical models of emotion regulation. we also examined how distress tolerance-an important emotion regulation ability-relates to strategy use. we conducted meta-analyses estimating the correlations between emotion regulation strategies (based on 331 samples and 670 effect sizes), as well as between distress tolerance and strategies. the resulting meta-analytic correlation matrix was submitted to confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses. none of the confirmatory models, based on prior theory, was an acceptable fit to the data. exploratory factor analysis suggested that 3 underlying factors best characterized these data. two factors-labeled disengagement and aversive cognitive perseveration-emerged as strongly correlated but distinct factors, with the latter consisting of putatively maladaptive strategies. the third factor, adaptive engagement, was a less unified factor and weakly related to the other 2 factors. distress tolerance was most closely associated with low levels of repetitive negative thought and experiential avoidance, and high levels of acceptance and mindfulness. we discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and applications to emotion regulation assessment.
borderline_personality_disorder	the current study was aimed to test a developmental model of dissociation. this model is based on clinical observations and research findings concerning the role of childhood emotional neglect in the development and maintenance of dissociative symptoms. seven hundred ninety-two adult volunteers completed questionnaires on parental bonding, theory of mind, alexithymia, and dissociation. significant associations were found between the investigated variables, and a multiple mediation analysis showed that the relationship between childhood emotional neglect and dissociation was totally mediated by theory of mind and alexithymia. the findings of this study support the view that childhood experiences of emotional neglect may foster difficulties mentalizing as well as problems with affect regulation, with these two factors interacting to generate excessively activated dissociative processes. this may suggest that individuals who were exposed to emotional neglect during their childhood and who currently suffer from dissociative symptoms may greatly benefit from clinical interventions aimed to foster mentalized affectivity.
borderline_personality_disorder	although appearance-based cues can help to diagnose physical illness, visual manifestations of mental disorder may be more elusive. here, we investigated whether individuals could distinguish women with a serious mental disorder (borderline personality disorder) from demographically- and iq-matched non-psychiatric controls. participants rated mentally ill targets as more likely to have a mental disorder from photos more accurately than chance, despite not believing that such judgments were possible. the configuration of facial cues played an important role in these judgments, as interfering with the spatial relationships between facial features reduced participants' accuracy to chance guessing. further investigation showed similar results when participants rated the targets for specific mental disorders (borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder) and rated the mentally ill targets as more depressed, angry, anxious, disgusted, emotionally unstable, distressed, and less happy. moreover, the depression ratings significantly correlated with the targets' actual depressive symptoms. thus, individuals may be able to infer aspects of mental disorder from minimal facial cues.
borderline_personality_disorder	impulsive behavior and underlying brain processes are hypothesized to be central in the development and maintenance of pathological gambling. inhibition ability can be differentially impaired in pathological gamblers (pgs). the goal of this cross-sectional study is to compare common inhibition measures in the discrimination of pg and healthy controls (hc). pg (n = 51) and hc (n = 51) performed the ""response inhibition"" (the go/no-go), the ""interference inhibition"" (the stroop), and the ""reflective inhibition"" (the matching familiar figures, mfft) tasks. augmented total interference response time in the stroop task (eta(2) = 0.054), high number of commission errors (eta(2) = 0.053) in the go/no-go task, and total number of errors in the mfft (eta(2) = 0.05) can discriminate pgs. slow response time in the go/no-go task (eta(2) = 0.038) has borderline ability, but the number of errors in the incongruent condition, total interference in terms of error rate, number of omissions in the go/no-go task, and first response time in the mfft could not differentiate between the pg and the hc there were no significant correlations between inhibition measures. most inhibition measures are not relevant to gambling. pgs do not express rash impulsive behavior such as quick answer without thinking. in contrary,the inhibition impairment was related to slow-inaccurate performance.

borderline_personality_disorder	objective: this pilot study was a comparison of dimensional models assessing personality traits and personality pathology in a clinical sample of adults diagnosed with adhd and adults diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (bpd), and a nonclinical control sample of healthy adults. method: personality traits were assessed using the neo-personality inventory-revised (neo-pi-r) and dimensional personality pathology with the dimensional assessment of personality pathology-basic questionnaire (dapp-bq). results: adults with adhd and bpd produced higher emotional dysregulation/neuroticism and dissocial behavior scores than controls. for the extraversion/inhibitedness scale, adults with bpd produced significantly lower scores than adults with adhd and controls. on the conscientiousness/compulsivity domains, conscientiousness scores were lower for both disorders, whereas low compulsivity values were specific to adult adhd. conclusion: our results suggest that patients with adult adhd and bpd have distinguishable profiles of personality traits and personality pathology.
borderline_personality_disorder	objective: given the paucity of research among prisoners, this study aimed to examine the prevalence and psychiatric comorbidity associated with adult adhd. method: the study was conducted at four nsw correctional facilities (2 male; 2 female). results: thirty-five percent of the sample screened positive for adult adhd, and 17% of the sample met criteria for a full diagnosis. after adjustment, benzodiazepine dependence, borderline personality disorder, social phobia, antisocial personality disorder, and a number of lifetime psychological disorders remained significantly and independently associated with the diagnosis of adult adhd. lowering the threshold on the adhd self-rating scale to 3 (vs. 4) increased the sensitivity (80%-93%), but lowered the specificity (55%-47%). conclusion: adult adhd among nsw prisoners is elevated, with substance use disorders and psychiatric comorbidity common. a greater acceptance of this disorder among prisoners, and appropriate treatment, is warranted.
prosocial_behavior	this cross-cultural study examines, first, whether 18-month-olds' helping behavior differs between cultures and, second, the way in which caregivers' socialization goals and practices are associated with toddlers' helping behavior. helping behavior was assessed in three out-of-reach tasks with increasing motivational demands. we found that delhi toddlers (n = 32) helped more than munster toddlers (n = 60). regarding socialization practices (sps), delhi mothers, compared with munster mothers, reported to provide more opportunities to help in the family context and to praise less when fostering toddlers' prosocial behavior. furthermore, delhi mothers reported to use more punitive practices after their children did not follow a helping request. on an intra-cultural level, we found that helping was positively associated with punitive practices in the delhi sample, whereas helping was negatively related with punitive practices and providing opportunities to help in munster. on the basis of these results, we first propose that culture affects toddlers' helping behavior from the time of emergence during the second year. second, we propose that the culture-specific conceptions of prosocial behavior influence which sps parents use, which, in turn, may influence children 's motivation underlying early prosocial behavior.
prosocial_behavior	this research examines the positive role of consumer education in diffusing innovative, sustainable products (isps). to enhance the effectiveness of a consumer education campaign, this study explores the type of message framing that can best facilitate product adoption among three different approaches: positive, negative, and hybrid framing. this study also investigates consumer traits and retailer attributes that facilitate or deter product adoption. the empirical application using biofuels shows that a negatively framed educational message highlighting the negative impact of gasoline (versus biofuels) is most effective in leveraging the social desirability of product adoption against its economic disadvantages. consumertraits positively associated with the adoption of biobutanol are environmental consciousness, prosocial behavior, and openness to new experiences, whereas vertical individualism discourages such adoption. furthermore, retailer choice attributes of location and payment convenience facilitate adoption, while retailer choice attributes based on price and servicescape cleanliness discourage such adoption.

prosocial_behavior	this psychophysiological study is the first to examine the relationship between emotional tears and emotional piloerection (i.e., goosebumps). although both phenomena have been related to peak states of being moved, details about their temporal occurrence and the associated levels of physiological arousal have remained unknown. in our study, we used emotionally powerful film scenes that were self-selected by participants. our findings show that even within peak moments of emotional arousal, a gradation of intensity is possible. the overlap of tears and goosebumps signifies a maximal climax within peak moments. on the side of the stimulus, we found that displays of prosocial behavior play a crucial role in the elicitation of tears and goosebumps. finally, based on the results of a formal film analysis of the tears-eliciting clips provided by our participants, as compared to randomly extracted, equally long control clips from the same films, we show how the technical and artistic making of the clips was optimized for the display of social interaction and emotional expressions.
prosocial_behavior	communication between parents and their children represents an important factor of family socialization. nevertheless, little is known about why parents communicate in different ways and how these qualitative differences in parent-child communication may affect the child. building on self-determination theory, the present study focuses on motivational antecedents of need-supportive communication as a function of parental child-related beliefs (i.e.,long-term goals that parents have set for their children 's future, and parental child-related behavior expectations in terms of parental dissatisfaction or satisfaction with child behavior). moreover, the effect of perceived need-supportive communication on children 's prosocial behavior and (externalizing and internalizing) behavioral difficulties will be addressed. three waves of data from 1125 mothers and adolescents aged between 10 and 17 years were analyzed using growth-curve modeling. we found linearly increasing trajectories in extrinsic parental goals for children and dissatisfaction with child behavior, and decreasing trajectories of need-supportive communication. individual differences do not vary significantly over time. in addition, holding extrinsic parental goals for children positively predicts parents' dissatisfaction with their child 's behavior and negatively predicts need-supportive communication. parents' dissatisfaction with their child 's behavior also contributes to decreasing need-supportive communication. as expected, need-supportive communication predicts prosocial behavior and externalizing behavioral difficulties. when need-supportive communication decreases over time, both externalizing and internalizing behavioral difficulties increase. furthermore, the effect of mothers beliefs on adolescents socioemotional development was mediated through perceived mother 's communication quality. these results suggest that parental child-related beliefs are important motivational antecedents of parent-child communication that may prevent behavioral difficulties.
prosocial_behavior	introduction. the perception of a direct gaze that is, of another individual 's gaze directed at the observer that leads to eye contact is known to influence a wide range of cognitive processes and behaviors. we stress that these effects mainly reflect positive impacts on human cognition and may thus be used as relevant tools for therapeutic purposes. objectives. in this review, we aim (1) to provide an exhaustive review of eye contact effects while discussing the limits of the dominant models used to explain these effects, (2) to illustrate the therapeutic potential of eye contact by targeting those pathologies that show both preserved gaze processing and deficits in one or several functions that are targeted by the eye contact effects, and (3) to propose concrete ways in which eye contact could be employed as a therapeutic tool. discussion. (1) we regroup the variety of eye contact effects into four categories, including memory effects, activation of prosocial behavior, positive appraisals of self and others and the enhancement of self-awareness. we emphasize that the models proposed to account for these effects have a poor predictive value and that further descriptions of these effects is needed. (2) we then emphasize that people with pathologies that affect memory, social behavior, and self and/or other appraisal, and self-awareness could benefit from eye contact effects. we focus on depression, autism and alzheimer 's disease to illustrate our proposal. to our knowledge, no anomaly of eye contact has been reported in depression. patients suffering from alzheimer disease, at the early and moderate stage, have been shown to maintain a normal amount of eye contact with their interlocutor. we take into account that autism is controversial regarding whether gaze processing is preserved or altered. in the first view, individuals are thought to elude or omit gazing at another 's eyes while in the second, individuals are considered to not be able to process the gaze of others. we adopt the first stance following the view that people with autism are not interested in processing social signals such as gaze but could do so efficiently if properly motivated. for each pathology we emphasize that eye contact could be used, for example, to enhance sensitivity to bodily states, thus improving emotional decision making (in autism); to lead to more positive appraisal of the self and others (in depression); to improve memory performances (in alzheimer disease) and, more generally, to motivate the recipient to engage in the therapeutic process. (3) finally we propose two concrete ways to employ eye contact effects as a therapeutic tool. the first is to develop cognitive-behavioral tools to learn and/or motivate the recipient to create frequent and prolonged eye contact periods. the second is to raise awareness among caregivers of the beneficial effects of eye contact and to teach them the way to use eye contact to reach its optimum effects. future investigations are however needed to explore the ways in which eye contact effects can be efficiently integrated in therapeutic strategies, as well as to identify the clinical populations that can benefit from such therapeutic interventions.

prosocial_behavior	preschoolers have a sophisticated understanding of reward and punishment. here we investigated whether children spontaneously correct unfair punishments. across two experiments, 3- and 4-year-olds engaged in a block-tower building task with a puppet in order to receive a reward (four stickers to be shared between the puppet and the child). the puppet then either accidentally or intentionally knocked over the tower. in both cases, an adult, who did not observe the intentionality of the outcome, punished the puppet by giving all the stickers to the child. after hearing the puppet protest, children were more likely to correct the adult 's punishment (i.e., share stickers with the puppet) when puppet 's actions were accidental rather than intentional. our results suggest that rather than passively accepting rewards and punishments imposed by authority figures, young children spontaneously correct situations they potentially believe are unfair.

prosocial_behavior	recent studies provided evidence for an impact of social relations on preschool children 's sharing behavior. children have been shown to be more generous towards friends than nonfriends or strangers. as evidence comes largely from studies with western children, little is known about cross-cultural differences and commonalities in this pattern. here, we show that preschool and elementary school aged ugandan children show high levels of generosity independent of the social relationships with the recipient. this finding points to societal differences in early sharing. the results are discussed in terms of a formative impact of cultural traditions on the early development of sharing in the preschool years.
prosocial_behavior	prosocial media effects, short-and long-term intrapersonal changes in prosocial personality traits, values, emotions, and behavior caused by media use, have attracted much less attention than media violence research. empirical examinations of current theories of prosocial media effects have focused on the indirect effects of prosocial media that explain why exposure to it results in prosocial behavior. however, they have neglected other types of media effects. further, because of philosophical biases in the field of communication, only the social-cultural perspective has been used to explain the psychological antecedents and consequences of prosocial media effects. the origins and ultimate functions of prosociality in the processes of media effects are unknown. the intersection of evolutionary theories and media effects theories provides a more comprehensive explanation of prosocial media effects. using various evolutionary perspectives on altruism, reciprocity, and cooperation, this article synthesizes 4 types of prosocial media effects: selective, indirect, conditional, and transactional, suggesting that the dramatic prosocial media learning process should be considered from a comprehensive nature-nurture interactive view. the research agenda, implications, and recent methodological advances are highlighted.
prosocial_behavior	studies on crowding out document that incentives sometimes backfiredecreasing motivation in prosocial tasks. in the present research, we demonstrated an additional channel through which incentives can be harmful. incentivized advocates for a cause are perceived as less sincere than nonincentivized advocates and are ultimately less effective in persuading other people to donate. further, the negative effects of incentives hold only when the incentives imply a selfish motive; advocates who are offered a matching incentive (i.e., who are told that the donations they successfully solicit will be matched), which is not incompatible with altruism, perform just as well as those who are not incentivized. thus, incentives may affect prosocial outcomes in ways not previously investigated: by crowding out individuals' sincerity of expression and thus their ability to gain support for a cause.
prosocial_behavior	the parent-report strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq-p) is a widely used scale that assesses children 's and adolescents' strengths and difficulties. the present study applied this scale to italian adolescents and compared the current results with previous chinese findings and the united kingdom norm. participants were 422 italian parents and their adolescent children. parents and adolescents answered the parent-report and the self-report sdq, respectively. results showed that the five-factor first-order model was better than other competing models. cronbach 's alpha of emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, prosocial behavior, and total difficulties was .63, .52, .69, .51, .59, and .77 respectively for mother-report measure, and .67, .48, .67, .46, .55, and .79 respectively for father-report measure. parent-adolescent agreements ranged from low to medium, whereas mother-father agreements were large. parents did not rate boys and girls as well as early-adolescence and mid-adolescence differently. italian parents rated their adolescent children to have lower levels of hyperactivity, peer problems, total difficulties, and higher levels of prosocial behavior than chinese parents; and italian mothers rated their adolescent children to have lower levels of hyperactivity than united kingdom parents. in conclusion, the current findings suggest both strengths and inadequacies of the sdq-p for italian adolescents.
false_memories	events consist of diverse elements, each processed in specialized neocortical networks, with temporal lobe memory systems binding these elements to form coherent event memories. we provide a novel theoretical analysis of an unexplored consequence of the independence of memory systems for elements and their bindings, 1 that raises the paradoxical prediction that schema-driven false memories can act solely on the binding of event elements despite the superior retrieval of individual elements. this is because if 2, or more, schema-relevant elements are bound together in unexpected conjunctions, the unexpected conjunction will increase attention during encoding to both the elements and their bindings, but only the bindings will receive competition with evoked schema-expected bindings. we test our model by examining memory for object-location bindings in recognition (study 1) and recall (studies 2 and 3) tasks. after studying schema-relevant objects in unexpected locations (e.g., pan on a stool in a kitchen scene), participants who then viewed these objects in expected locations (e.g., pan on stove) at test were more likely to falsely remember this object-location pairing as correct, compared with participants that viewed a different unexpected object-location pairing (e.g., pan on floor). in recall, participants were more likely to correctly remember individual schema-relevant objects originally viewed in unexpected, as opposed to expected locations, but were then more likely to misplace these items in the original room scene to expected places, relative to control schema-irrelevant objects. our theoretical analysis and novel paradigm provide a tool for investigating memory distortions acting on binding processes.
false_memories	previous research has attributed to the right hemisphere (rh) a key role in eliciting false memories to visual emotional stimuli. these results have been explained in terms of two right-hemisphere properties: (i) that emotional stimuli are preferentially processed in the rh and (ii) that visual stimuli are represented more coarsely in the ri-i. according to this account, false emotional memories are preferentially produced in the rh because emotional stimuli are both more strongly and more diffusely activated during encoding, leaving a memory trace that can be erroneously reactivated by similar but unstudied emotional items at test. if this right-hemisphere hypothesis is correct, then rh damage should result in a reduction in false memories to emotional stimuli relative to left-hemisphere lesions. to investigate this possibility, groups of right-brain-damaged (rbd, n = 15), left-brain-damaged (lbd, n = 15) and healthy (hc, n = 30) participants took part in a recognition memory experiment with emotional (negative and positive) and non-emotional pictures. false memories were operationalized as incorrect responses to unstudied pictures that were similar to studied ones. both rbd and lbd participants showed similar reductions in false memories for negative pictures relative to controls. for positive pictures, however, false memories were reduced only in rbd patients. the results provide only partial support for the right-hemisphere hypothesis and suggest that inter-hemispheric cooperation models may be necessary to fully account for false emotional memories.

false_memories	veridical and false memories of children aged 6 to 15 years were studied in two experiments with the retrieval-induced forgetting paradigm. using the deese-roediger-mcdermott (drm) false memory word lists, children 's reports of true, but not false, memories showed evidence of retrieval-induced forgetting. these differences were observed across delays as long as 2 days following word list presentation. the lack of observation of retrieval-induced forgetting in children 's false memories provides evidence that a key assumption in the theory of retrieval-induced forgetting, cue independence, might not consistently apply. these experiments underscore the need for both practical and theoretically motivated study of true and false memories.

false_memories	recollection is currently modeled as a univariate retrieval process in which memory probes provoke conscious awareness of contextual details of earlier target presentations. however, that conception cannot explain why some manipulations that increase recollection in recognition experiments suppress false memory in false memory experiments, whereas others increase false memory. such contrasting effects can be explained if recollection is bivariate-if memory probes can provoke conscious awareness of target items per se, separately from awareness of contextual details, with false memory being suppressed by the former but increased by the latter. interestingly, these 2 conceptions of recollection have coexisted for some time in different segments of the memory literature. independent support for the dual-recollection hypothesis is provided by some surprising effects that it predicts, such as release from recollection rejection, false persistence, negative relations between false alarm rates and target remember/know judgments, and recollection without remembering. we implemented the hypothesis in 3 bivariate recollection models, which differ in the degree to which recollection is treated as a discrete or a graded process: a pure multinomial model, a pure signal detection model, and a mixed multinomial/signal detection model. the models were applied to a large corpus of conjoint recognition data, with fits being satisfactory when both recollection processes were present and unsatisfactory when either was deleted. factor analyses of the models' parameter spaces showed that target and context recollection never loaded on a common factor, and the 3 models converged on the same process loci for the effects of important experimental manipulations. thus, a variety of results were consistent with bivariate recollection.
false_memories	according to one of the most prominent false memory theories (fuzzy trace theory), false memories stem from the semantic association between the original information and post-event misinformation. furthermore, the strength of this association predicts the probability of accepting the post-event misinformation as original information. in order to test this prediction within the eyewitness testimony framework, the current study used a video of a mock-theft and a narrative of the event in which some original information was changed as post-event misinformation. to that end, the strong and the weak members of the category to which original information belongs to, and semantically unrelated options were given as distractors in addition to the original information in a recognition test. analysis revealed that semantically strong and weak distractors were significantly more likely to be accepted as original information than the semantically unrelated item. semantically strong distractors were accepted as original information more than weak distractors, although the difference did not reach significance. findings were discussed in terms of fuzzy trace theory and the ""developmental reversals"" approach by brainerd and reyna (2012).
false_memories	in the first few years of life children spend a good proportion of time sleeping as well as acquiring the meanings of hundreds of words. there is now ample evidence of the effects of sleep on memory in adults and the number of studies demonstrating the effects of napping and nocturnal sleep in children is also mounting. in particular, sleep appears to benefit children 's memory for recently-encountered novel words. the effect of sleep on children 's generalization of novel words across multiple items, however, is less clear. given that sleep is polyphasic in the early years, made up of multiple episodes, and children 's word learning is gradual and strengthened slowly over time, it is highly plausible that sleep is a strong candidate in supporting children 's memory for novel words. importantly, it appears that when children sleep shortly after exposure to novel word-object pairs retention is better than if sleep is delayed, suggesting that napping plays a vital role in long-term word retention for young children. word learning is a complex, challenging, and important part of development, thus the role that sleep plays in children 's retention of novel words is worthy of attention. as such, ensuring children get sufficient good quality sleep and regular opportunities to nap may be critical for language acquisition.
false_memories	the present study provides norms for deese/roediger-mcdermott (drm) lists that were used to create false memories in native speakers of italian. the word lists reported in this article are based on the drm lists that have been used extensively to examine illusory memories in english speakers (deese in journal of experimental psychology, 58, 17-22, 1959; roediger & mcdermott in journal of experimental psychology: learning, memory, & cognition, 21, 803-814, 1995). we translated the 24 critical lures from 24 english drm lists and created semantically associated italian word lists that were then normed with native italian speakers. overall, the participants recalled 63 % of the list items and 22 % of the critical lures with the word lists developed. in addition, 56 % of the list items and 82 % of the critical lures were recognized by the participants. the present study provides a set of italian lists that can be used by researchers interested in evaluating false memories in italian-speaking participants.
false_memories	the semantic network approach to obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) represents a new cognitive approach to understanding the condition. with a dimensional perspective on oc symptoms, we attempted to: (1) uncover a contamination-relevant semantic network in an unselected undergraduate sample; and (2) validate the purported mechanism of association splitting, a network-based intervention for oc symptoms. contamination-relevant, negatively valenced, and neutral deese/roediger-mcdermott (drm) word lists were presented, accompanied by relational or item-specific semantic processing simulations of obsessions or association splitting, respectively. good veridical recognition performance across list types was observed with simulated obsessions and association splitting. substantial false recognition rates across critical lure types followed simulated obsessions; such rates were lower with simulated association splitting. network-based accounts of the contamination-relevant findings supported the aforementioned research aims. additionally, enhanced contamination-relevant veridical recognition confidence with simulated association splitting suggests a memory confidence pathway through which the technique might reduce contamination-related symptoms. lastly, contamination-relevant recognition performance was not related to contamination-related symptom severity across conditions, signaling non-dimensionality in contamination-relevant semantic network intensification. our findings indicate the need for rigorous research on the semantic network approach to ocd to refine its tenets. association splitting should also be more extensively researched as a viable technique for treating ocd.

false_memories	this study determined that in an interactive augmented-reality context, vivid memories substantially influence four types of online exploratory consumption behavior (i.e., concentration, exploratory consumption behavior, playfulness, and time distortion), based on script theory. in addition, this study indicates that in an interactive augmented-reality context, consumers' sense of ownership control and autotelic need for touch significantly influence the relationship between vivid memories and the four types of exploratory consumption behavior, based on self-referencing theory. the results of this study can assist online vendors in using augmented-reality interactive technology for establishing consumer persuasion models.
false_memories	people often misremember the past as consistent with the present. recent research using an induced-compliance paradigm has revealed that cognitive dissonance is one mechanism that can underlie this memory distortion. we sought to replicate and extend this finding using a free-choice paradigm: participants made either an easy or a difficult choice between two smartphones and, either immediately or two days later, reported their memories for their decision experience. participants who made a difficult decision produced the spread-of-alternatives effect expected by dissonance theory, and they were also more likely than those in the easy conditions to misremember their initial decision more favourably than they had initially rated it. overall, our findings replicate the effect of dissonance on memory distortion and, further, show that the effect generalises to other dissonance-inducing situations.
problem-solving	word problems are prevalent on high-stakes assessments, and success on word problems has implications for grade promotion and graduation. unfortunately, english language learners (ells) continue to perform significantly below their native english-speaking peers on mathematics assessments featuring word problems. little is known about the instructional needs and performance of ells at risk of mathematics difficulty (md). in the present study, an exploratory quasi-experimental design was used to investigate word-problem instruction for ells in a culturally and linguistically diverse public elementary school. specifically, we studied the efficacy of a word-problem intervention for ells with md (n = 9) that combined culturally and linguistically responsive practices with schema instruction (clr-si). the study is unique in that it combines research on effective instruction for ells and students with md; clr-si has not been investigated for either ells or students with md. results have implications for teachers, administrators, and researchers of ells with md.
problem-solving	the role of emotion regulation in subclinical symptoms of mental disorders in adolescence is not yet well understood. this meta-analytic review examines the relationship between the habitual use of prominent adaptive emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescence. analyzing 68 effect sizes from 35 studies, we calculated overall outcomes across depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as psychopathology-specific outcomes. age was examined as a continuous moderator via meta-regression models. the results from random effects analyses revealed that the habitual use of all emotion regulation strategies was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms overall, with the adaptive emotion regulation strategies showing negative associations (i.e., less symptoms) with depressive and anxiety symptoms whereas the maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed positive associations (i.e., more symptoms). a less frequent use of adaptive and a more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms comparably in the respective directions. regarding the psychopathology-specific outcomes, depressive and anxiety symptoms displayed similar patterns across emotion regulation strategies showing the strongest negative associations with acceptance, and strongest positive associations with avoidance and rumination. the findings underscore the relevance of adaptive and also maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth, and highlight the need to further investigate the patterns of emotion regulation as a potential transdiagnostic factor.
problem-solving	we combine two lines of research on inventive and creative performance that have been separated before. we use empirical models of the performance of inventors over their careers based on an, established theoretical framework of the drivers of creativity, the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other (ksao) model. we link survey information spanning the inventors' entire careers and psychometric test evidence with patent history data for more than 1000 inventors. we also control for variables that have traditionally been used in studies of inventive performance including inventor age, applicant type, technology, patent, and time information. we show that educational level, skills acquired during the career, personality traits, career motivation, cognitive ability, and cognitive problem-solving style are significantly related to inventive performance.

problem-solving	this article analyses security discourses that are beginning to self-consciously take on board the shift towards the anthropocene. it first sets out the developing episteme of the anthropocene, highlighting the limits of instrumentalist cause-and-effect approaches to security, which are increasingly becoming displaced by discursive framings of securing as a process generated through new forms of mediation and agency and capable of grasping interrelations in a fluid context. this approach is the methodology of hacking: creatively composing and repurposing already existing forms of agency. it elaborates on hacking as a set of experimental practices and imaginaries of securing the anthropocene, using as a case study the field of digital policy activism with a focus on community empowerment through social-technical assemblages being developed and applied in the city of the anthropocene': jakarta, indonesia. the article concludes that policy interventions today cannot readily be grasped in modernist frameworks of problem solving' but should be seen more in terms of evolving and adaptive life hacks'.
problem-solving	this article reports results from a study investigating the efficacy of a proportional problem-solving intervention, schema-based instruction (sbi), in seventh grade. participants included 806 students with mathematical difficulties in problem solving (md-ps) from an initial pool of 1,999 seventh grade students in a larger study. teachers and their students in the larger study were randomly assigned to an sbi or control condition and teachers in both conditions then provided instruction on the topics of ratio, proportion, and percent. we found that students with md-ps in sbi classrooms scored on average higher than their counterparts in control classrooms on a posttest and delayed posttest administered 9 weeks later. given students' difficulties with proportional problem-solving and the consequences of these difficulties, an important contribution of this research is the finding that when provided with appropriate instruction, students with md-ps are capable of enhanced proportional problem-solving performance.
problem-solving	objective: sudden cardiac arrest caused by cardiac arrhythmias is 1 of the leading causes of death worldwide. implantable cardioverter defibrillators (icds) are considered as standard care for patients with increased risk of arrhythmias. however, 1 in 4 icd patients experiences psychological distress post-icd implantation. the web-based distress management program for icd patients (webcare) was developed to mitigate anxiety and depression and enhance health-related quality of life in icd patients. this study investigates the 6-and 12-months outcomes. method: a total of 289 consecutive icd patients from 6 referral hospitals in the netherlands were randomized to either the webcare (n = 146) or usual care (n = 143) group. patients in the webcare group received an online, 12-weeks fixed, 6 lesson behavioral treatment based on problem solving therapy. patients in the usual care group receive care as usual. results: current findings show no significant difference on anxiety, depression or quality of life between the webcare and usual care group at 6-and 12-months postimplantation. conclusions: in this clinical trial of a web-based behavioral intervention for icd patients, the web-based treatment was not superior to usual care on the long-term regarding patient reported outcomes. future studies are warranted to examine the applicability of blended-care models and focus on further personalizing the program in order to increase adherence and improve outcomes.
problem-solving	organizational values guide acceptable behavior and provide motivational dynamism. marketing channel literature has yet to address the impact of values on interfirm exchanges. we propose that value congruence between cooperating firms can be an effective governance method. this research examines the impact of value congruence between manufacturers and their primary distributors. survey data from 278 manufacturing firms demonstrate that perceived value congruence has a positive effect on distributors' performance. moreover, information sharing and joint problem solving serve as mechanisms that partially mediate the main effect. this research calls for integration of organizational values into partner selection and marketing channel governance.

problem-solving	this article identifies the trends and impact of applying information and communication technologies (ict) in the blended learning educational model, also known as blended learning, which proposes to make an integration between virtual and face-to-face oriented classes in classrooms. in this research, there are taken into account results and experiences in different educational areas, emphasizing mediation with ict. blended learning has achieved great impact thanks to the interaction between teachers and students, generating positive results in the teaching and learning process. the methodological aspects used with blended learning based on the use of ict to develop both online and virtual activities allow the participant to develop cognitive, competitive, critical and constructive thinking skills for problem solving. through this systematic review of literature, the importance of the use of ict within this methodology is acknowledged, as it allows a dynamic and adjustable learning process, making it a pioneer in educational environments because of its great effectiveness and interaction.
problem-solving	students with mathematics learning disabilities (mld) have a weak understanding of fraction concepts and skills, which are foundations of algebra. such students might benefit from computer-assisted instruction that utilizes evidence-based instructional components (cognitive strategies, feedback, virtual manipulatives). as a pilot study using a multiple baseline design, with multiple probes, this study investigated the effects of fun fraction, a multi-component computer-assisted instructional program, on word problem solving with fractions abilities of three middle school students with mld. mixed findings were observed on word problem solving performance from the baseline to intervention phase after students received instruction through fun fraction. the percentage of non-overlapping data ranged from 56% through 100%. limitations, suggestions for future research, and educational implications are discussed.
problem-solving	background: during the past decade, the concept of lean has spread rapidly within the healthcare sector, but there is a lack of instruments that can measure staff 's perceptions of lean adoption. thus, the aim of the present study was to develop a questionnaire measuring lean in healthcare, based on liker 's description of lean, by adapting an existing instrument developed for the service sector. methods: a mixed-method design was used. initially, items from the service sector instrument were categorized according to liker 's 14 principles describing lean within four domains: philosophy, processes, people and partners and problem-solving. items were lacking for three of liker 's principles and were therefore developed de novo. think-aloud interviews were conducted with 12 healthcare staff from different professions to contextualize and examine the face validity of the questionnaire prototype. thereafter, the adjusted questionnaire 's psychometric properties were assessed on the basis of a cross-sectional survey among 386 staff working in primary care. results: the think-aloud interviews led to adjustments in the questionnaire to better suit a healthcare context, and the number of items was reduced. confirmatory factor analysis of the adjusted questionnaire showed a generally acceptable correspondence with liker 's description of lean. internal consistency, measured using cronbach 's alpha, for the factors in liker 's description of lean was 0.60 for the factor people and partners, and over 0.70 for the three other factors. test-retest reliability measured by the intra-class correlation coefficient ranged from 0.77 to 0.88 for the four factors. conclusions: we designed a questionnaire capturing staff 's perceptions of lean adoption in healthcare on the basis of liker 's description. this lean in healthcare questionnaire (lihcq) showed generally acceptable psychometric properties, which supports its usability for measuring lean adoption in healthcare. we suggest that further research focus on verifying the usability of lihcq in other healthcare settings, and on adjusting the instrument if needed.
prejudice	past work on the political impact of racial diversity has focused on direct effects, demonstrating that diverse environments are associated with more negativeor in some circumstances, more positiveracial attitudes and race-targeted policy preferences. we show that diversity functions in a second way, as a variable that magnifies the political impact of individual differences in the psychological disposition of authoritarianism. using a national sample, we find that in white areas with minimal diversity, authoritarianism had no impact on racial prejudice, political intolerance, and attitudes toward immigration. as diversity rises, however, authoritarianism plays an increasingly dominant role in political judgment. in diverse environments, authoritarians become more racially, ethnically, and politically intolerant and nonauthoritarians less so. we conceptually replicate these findings in a dorm setting with plausibly exogenous levels of local diversity and discuss the implications of our findings in terms of the various ways in which ethno-racial diversity structures political attitudes.
prejudice	generalized prejudice (gp), biases expressed toward multiple outgroups, is typically explained by two aspects of authoritarianism: 'bowing' in the form of submission (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism, rwa); and 'kicking' in the form of dominance (i.e., social dominance orientation, sdo). whereas contemporary approaches treat rwa and sdo as separate gp predictors, we statistically model the commonality between rwa and sdo reflecting an underlying tendency toward generalized authoritarian (ga). re-analyzing data from an existing meta-analysis (study 1), and modelling meta-analytic data from studies containing clear gp-relevant information (study 2), we compare: (a) the standard approach of predicting gp based on rwa and sdo as unique predictors (model 1); with (b) an alternative approach based on a latent ga factor indicated by rwa and sdo (model 2). the alternative model provided stronger (and near-perfect) prediction of gp, along with specific associations between rwa and two types of prejudice (sexism, homophobia). these findings have fundamental implications for understanding authoritarianism and prejudice-proneness.

prejudice	residual carbon and ammonium in municipal wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) tail water lead fouling, and prejudice the operation and life time of reverse osmosis (ro) membrane. in this study, a new combined treatment system of ozone oyster shells fix-bed bioreactor (ofbr)-membrane bioreactor (mbr) was developed and pilot scale was tested for 110 days to intensify the removal of residual carbon and ammonium in wwtp tail water. this results showed that the mean maximum cod, ammonium and tp removal efficiencies were achieved by 73%, 99% and 43%, under the optimum ozone dosage of 70 mg l-1 and hrt of 25 h. the single contribution of ofbr and mbr was 62% and 38% to cod removal, 94% and 6% to ammonium removal, 63% and 37% to tp removal, respectively. high throughput sequencing data showed that there were rich bacterial populations (>2800 species), and deinococcus-thermus, firmicutes, actinobacteria and planctomyctes were dominant in both reactors. after addition of ozone, deinococcus-thermus and planctomyctes species bacteria increased significantly in ofbr, and firmicutes, actinobacteria and planctomyctes species bacteria increased remarkably in mbr, which might mainly contribute to carbon removal in ofbr and mbr, respectively. aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria were all existed in both reactors, which might be the main reasons for high removal efficiency of ammonium in ofbr-mbr system.

prejudice	people often mimic others more if the other is liked, a member of an ingroup, or in a cooperative relationship with the observer; we call this the interpersonal attitude effect. this study examines the degree to which this attitude effect on mimicry is an automatic or an effortful process. while under cognitive load or no load, participants observed positive, negative, and neutral others making emotional expressions. electromyography measured corrugator supercilii (knits brow) and zygomaticus major (raises corners of mouth) activity. under load, participants mimicked smiles of positive individuals but not neutral or negative individuals. during no-load trials, participants did not mimic negative individuals, but did mimic smiles of neutral and positive individuals. participants enhanced their smiles in response to the smiles of liked others without effort, but smiling at neutral others' smiles required greater cognitive resources.
prejudice	deindividuation may be described as the situation in which individuals act in groups and do not see themselves as individuals, thereby facilitating antinormative behavior. the present article analyzes the construct deindividuation theory from its conceptualization by le bon to the most recent theoretical model, the social identity model of deindividuation effects. the aim of this study is to compare theories about deindividuation and to highlight its advances, identify theoretical questions that remain and suggest future directions for the study of this issue. recent research conducted on deindividuation may promote prosocial behavior, prevent social disturbance and prevent the development of prejudice among children. furthermore, it may provide a feasible way to comprehend and intervene in contemporary social issues. recent scientific techniques, such as neuroimaging and predictive mathematical models, may improve comprehension of the construct in terms of its definition and prospective effects.
prejudice	non-verbal expressions of pride convey status. but pride displays can be interpreted as either authentic or hubristic. given negative stereotypes about blacks, we hypothesized that when displaying pride, blacks would be rated higher in hubristic and lower in authentic pride compared to whites. contrary to predictions, three experiments found consistent evidence that whites are judged to be more hubristic than blacks when displaying pride. this effect occurred when pride was displayed in an unspecified (study 1), academic (study 2), or work-related context (study 3). effects were largely specific to pride displays and not a function of a general race-based response bias. we speculate that these counterintuitive findings might reflect a negative reaction to those with high status flaunting their success.
prejudice	the aim of this research was to examine the pathway to intergroup forgiveness in postconflict contexts from the framework of improved intergroup relations and with an emphasis on identifying context-specific variables. two studies investigated the relationship between intergroup contact and ingroup contact norms, and postconflict forgiveness. in the context of anglo-german post-wwii relations, study 1 provided evidence that intergroup anxiety and common ingroup identity were significantly predicted by positive intergroup contact and ingroup norms, which then predicted forgiveness of the german outgroup for wartime actions. accordingly, focusing on greek and turkish cypriot relations in cyprus the results of study 2 showed that positive contact with greek cypriots and ingroup contact norms were related to decreased intergroup anxiety and dehumanization, which in turn were associated with increased forgiveness. the results are discussed in the context of intergroup relations and postconflict resolution.
prejudice	purpose - mortality is a salient factor during capital sentencing. the purpose of this paper is to examine the role death plays in jurors' decisions when sentencing a severely mentally ill defendant who is subject to possible discrimination in a capital trial because of that status. design/methodology/approach - the current experiment measured venire jurors' (n = 133) mental illness dangerousness beliefs, and then experimentally manipulated type of mortality salience (dual-focused: participants who contemplated their own mortality and were exposed to trial-related death references vs trial focused: only exposed to death references) and the type of defendant (severely mentally ill vs neutral) accused of a capital offense. findings - mock jurors perceived mental illness to be an important mitigating factor when dual (i.e. self) focused mortality (dfm) salience was induced, whereas participants only exposed to trial-related death references considered mental illness to be an aggravating factor in sentencing and were more likely to evidence stereotype adherence toward the defendant. practical implications - the implications of the authors' findings are problematic for the current legal system. during the majority of capital sentencing, jurors will only be exposed to trial-related death references, as individuals in the trial-focused mortality condition were. the findings suggest that these jurors are likely to engage in discriminatory stereotypes that do not consider fair process when making sentencing decisions. this research also suggests that mortality salience may be able to increase jurors' attention to such concerns in a trial scenario even when negative mental illness stereotypes are present. originality/value - research builds on existing terror management theory and offers a more nuanced perspective of how focusing on one 's own death can affect jurors' reliance on stereotypes and lead to inappropriate decisions. mortality salience can lead to decisions based upon procedural fairness when stereotypes and mortality salience are both present.
prejudice	this study is linked to research into narrative persuasion and the techniques used to reduce rejection of stigmatized groups. upper-secondary school students were assigned to one of two conditions: viewing a film that arouses empathy toward immigrants or seeing a film that underscores positive intergroup contact. one month before viewing the films the participants completed the modern racism scale. after they viewed the films, researchers measured their identification with ingroup and outgroup characters and their attitudes toward immigration. results showed that viewing the empathyarousing film caused greater identification with the outgroup characters, which in turn induced more positive attitudes toward immigration, but only when previous prejudice was low or moderate. we discuss findings in the context of narrative persuasion research.
prejudice	adolescents' participation in intergroup conflicts comprises an imminent global risk, and understanding its neural underpinnings may open new perspectives. we assessed jewish-israeli and arab-palestinian adolescents for brain response to the pain of ingroup/outgroup protagonists using magnetoencephalography (meg), one-on-one positive and conflictual interactions with an outgroup member, attitudes toward the regional conflict, and oxytocin levels. a neural marker of ingroup bias emerged, expressed via alpha modulations in the somatosensory cortex (s1) that characterized an automatic response to the pain of all protagonists followed by rebound/enhancement to ingroup pain only. adolescents' hostile social interactions with outgroup members and uncompromising attitudes toward the conflict influenced this neural marker. furthermore, higher oxytocin levels in the jewish-israeli majority and tighter brain-to-brain synchrony among group members in the arab-palestinian minority enhanced the neural ingroup bias. findings suggest that in cases of intractable intergroup conflict, top-down control mechanisms may block the brain 's evolutionary-ancient resonance to outgroup pain, pinpointing adolescents' interpersonal and sociocognitive processes as potential targets for intervention.
antisocial_personality_disorder	neonaticide is an infant murder occurring on the day of birth. the case reports found in the literature are often focused on the mother as the agent in the context of pregnancy denial, dissociative symptoms, or psychosis. however, this report describes a rare case of attempted serial neonaticides, in which the acts were committed by a nurse at the nursery of a referral hospital in brazil. the authors describe a forensic psychiatric evaluation for criminal responsibility and correlate the information from this particular case with relevant forensic themes, namely neonaticide, munchausen by proxy syndrome, and serial healthcare killers.
antisocial_personality_disorder	this systematic review aims to identify evidences of distortions in time perception (tp) in people with impulsivity disorders or other conditions having impulsivity traits, namely traumatic brain injuries, certain personality disorders, addictive behavior disorders, and pathological gambling. studies related to tp deficits and impulsivity disorders were retrieved from multiple literature databases, through predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. from the 197 obtained documents, 47 were selected for analysis, and a final set of 15 studies was retrieved for this review. regardless of some conflicting findings, the available results suggest that patients with orbitofrontal lesions produce and reproduce significantly less time and estimate time periods significantly longer than healthy subjects. patients with borderline personality disorder show decreased time perception and patients with antisocial personality disorder seem to execute more premature responses during time estimation tasks. stimulant dependent individuals also tend to overestimate the time intervals, and pathological gamblers demonstrate shorter time horizons than social gamblers. taken together, the available data suggest that impulsive individuals tend to overestimate the passage of time and to execute more premature responses, producing and reproducing less time, but more research is necessary to increase the strength of the evidences on this issue. this systematic review updates evidences of distortions in tp in impulsivity, improving the understanding of the relations between these two variables.

antisocial_personality_disorder	introductionyouths with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders (fh+) are at greater risk of developing substance-use disorders relative to those with no such family histories (fh-). we previously reported that fh+ youths have elevated activity in the supplementary motor area (sma) and dorsal striatum while performing go/no-go tasks and have reduced frontal white matter integrity. a better understanding of relationships between these variables would provide insight into how frontostriatal circuitry is altered in fh+ youths, which may be an important contributor to their elevated risk. methodsin this study, we used structural equation modeling (sem) to test interactions between activity in the sma and dorsal striatum in 72 fh+ and 32 fh- youths during go/no-go task performance and to determine whether increased activity in these regions in fh+ youths can be at least partially explained by reduced frontal white matter integrity, as indexed by anterior corona radiata fractional anisotropy and n-acetylaspartate. resultsincreased dorsal striatum activity explained most (similar to 75%) of the elevated sma activity in fh+ youths, and the combined contributions of increased dorsal striatal activity, and decreased white matter integrity fully explained the elevated sma activity. conclusionsthese results suggest the elevated frontal cortical activity in fh+ youths is driven both by their increased striatal activity via downstream projections and reduced white matter integrity in frontal cortical projections, the latter likely increasing frontal cortical activity due to increased energy demands required for action potential propagation. as part of our ongoing longitudinal studies we will examine howthese frontostriatal alterations relate to risk for developing substance-use disorders.
antisocial_personality_disorder	this study measured the cerebellar volume of normal male adults in 20s with magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and analysed the relationship between cerebellar volume and various psychological parameters. the cerebellar volume of 58 males (mean age, 24.0 +/- 2.8 years) was measured using mri. the symptom checklist-90-r (scl-90-r) and the component of type a behavior tests were performed. using linear regression analysis, the relationship between cerebellar volume and psychological parameters was analysed. as phobic anxiety and ambition increased, cerebellar volume of normal male subjects in 20s decreased. this study showed that for even normal male adults, there exists a possible relationship between various psychological parameters and cerebellar volume.

antisocial_personality_disorder	people who inject drugs (pwid) and have mental health conditions, such as major depression, an anxiety disorder, or antisocial or borderline personality disorder, may have elevated risk for hiv and hcv infection. this study examined the associations between psychiatric disorders and risky injection behavior in an out-of-treatment sample of young pwid. we recruited participants through outreach and respondent-driven sampling (rds). participants completed a computer-assisted self-interview and a psychiatric interview. interviews took place at a community-based field site of the community outreach intervention projects. participants were 570 young adults (18 to 25 years) who injected drugs in the previous 30 days. psychiatric diagnoses were based on interviews using the psychiatric research interview for substance and mental disorders (prism). injection behavior was classified into 3 categories: receptive syringe sharing, other equipment sharing only, and no sharing. associations between injection risk behavior and psychiatric diagnoses were tested using rds-weighted multinomial regressions. substance-induced lifetime and past-year major depression, and borderline personality disorder, were significantly associated with a greater likelihood of receptive syringe sharing (p<.001). substance-induced major depression in the past year was also associated with nonsyringe equipment sharing (p<.01). primary major depression, antisocial personality disorder, and anxiety disorders other than posttraumatic stress disorder were slightly more prevalent among injectors who shared syringes; however, the associations were not statistically significant. substance-induced major depression and borderline personality disorder are common among young pwid and are associated with risky injection behavior.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the p3 amplitude reduction is one of the most common correlates of externalizing. however, few studies have used experimental manipulations designed to challenge different cognitive functions in order to clarify the processes that impact this reduction. to examine factors moderating p3 amplitude in trait externalizing, we administered an n-back task that manipulated cognitive control demands, working memory load, and incentives to a sample of male offenders. offenders with high trait externalizing scores did not display a global reduction in p3 amplitude. rather, the negative association between trait externalizing and p3 amplitude was specific to trials involving inhibition of a dominant response during infrequent stimuli, in the context of low working memory load, and incentives for performance. in addition, we discuss the potential implications of these findings for externalizing-related psychopathologies. the results complement and expand previous work on the process-level dysfunction contributing to externalizing-related deficits in p3.

antisocial_personality_disorder	background: evidence suggests the relationship between personality disorder (pd) and violence in offenders might be clarified by considering subgroups of pd offenders defined by patterns of pd comorbidity. aim: to identify patterns of pd comorbidity associated with severe violence, defined by its severity, quantity and age of onset (violence index: vi) in a forensic sample of 100 pd offenders. methods: correlations were first computed between vi and a range of personality and criminological variables; next, patients with antisocial/borderline comorbidity were compared with other pd patients; finally, regression analysis was conducted to identify unique predictors of vi. results: the antisocial deviance factor of psychopathy and antisocial/borderline comorbidity were each significantly and independently associated with severe violence. patients showing both a high psychopathy score and antisocial/borderline comorbidity had a significantly greater vi than those without these characteristics. conclusion: pd patients with high psychopathy co-occurring with borderline and antisocial pds show a criminal profile characterised by a high degree of serious violence.
antisocial_personality_disorder	social anxiety disorder (sad) and antisocial personality disorder (aspd) are not often thought of as being comorbid. however, recent research suggests the existence of a sad subtype with characteristics atypical of sad but common to aspd. thus, we explored two competing hypotheses: (i) sad and aspd represent opposite ends of a single dimension, or (2) sad and aspd exist on two separate dimensions that may be positively correlated. data were obtained from the national epidemiological survey on alcohol and related conditions. sad-aspd was related to greater impairment and psychiatric comorbidity than either disorder alone. the sad-aspd group was also more likely to seek treatment for their sad symptoms and to drink before/during antisocial acts than the sad only group. the presence of sad for individuals with aspd (and vice versa) does not appear to provide any ""protective benefits."" sad and aspd appear to be two separate but correlated disorders.

antisocial_personality_disorder	this article reviews the process by which the dsm-5 personality disorder (pd) proposal for change was developed, challenged, and then ultimately rejected. the dsm-5 workgroup 's mandate to introduce radical changes were inherently fraught by the limited time allowed, but their efforts were undermined by dissension within the committee, the lack of a clearly identified scientific rationale, and by the inconsistent dialogue with the existing community of pd experts. nonetheless, valuable steps were taken to establish a better definition for pd 's, introduce dimensions, and identify the steps needed for future revisions. the author only in retrospect has concluded that borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder be treated differently than other pd 's because of their clinical significance and empirical support. specifically, these ""major"" pd 's should remain on axis i, while other pd 's are secondary disorders that are more comfortably dimensionalized and belong on axis ii.
antisocial_personality_disorder	early adverse experiences such as abuse or neglect can influence brain development and consequently bring forth a predisposition toward mental and behavioral disorders. many authors suggest that long-term changes in the functionality of the hpa axis might be involved in mediating this relationship. the direction of change and its consequences have not been clarified though: do early adverse experiences yield a stable glucocorticoid hyperfunction or a long-term glucocorticoid hypofunction, and how is this change of functionality associated with mental or behavioral disorders? this review summarizes correlative findings and illustrates inconsistencies of current research literature. it focuses on the specific neurochemical milieu accompanying early adverse experiences and discusses possible interactions of the glucocorticoid system with oxytocin and components of the serotonergic system. on the basis of this physiological view, a novel two-pathway model is presented, according to which specific early experiences are associated with characteristic early changes in the functionality of these systems and result in a predisposition to distinct mental and behavioral disorders.

nonverbal_communication	the purpose of this white paper is to call for research on the intersection of dress, type 1 diabetes (t1d), and adolescent development. management of t1d requires frequent blood glucose monitoring, and the individual is dependent on regular delivery of insulin through injections or an insulin pump. much of the literature on t1d focuses on fostering healthy habits. the role of dress and identity is rarely addressed. the example of an adolescent teen with t1d is employed to demonstrate how equipment for blood glucose control fulfills the definition of dress. a review of literature reveals a body of knowledge on dress and identity, t1d and adolescent development, and t1d and identity. interdisciplinary research on the intersection of these three factors is needed. at a point in life when most teens want to look unique but not too different from friends, managing the gear that maintains health and communicates diabetic identity must be better understood to support the patient.
nonverbal_communication	proverbs are folkloric products with important references to cultural codes, behavioral patterns, suppositions related to various issues, and imagination of a society. these products may relate to countless topics from the notions of social life, up- to approaches to education and social gender issues, from otherization tendencies to paradigms for governance and applications of authority. a particular topic among them is the phenomenon of communication and communication acts. therefore, proverbs can be scanned for clues explaining communication phenomena, socially approved and proposed. communication acts. starting from this presupposition, the essential aim of the study is the communicational phenomena in turkish proverbs and to explore explicit and/or hidden messaging related to communicational acts. in this sense, this study is a significant contribution to the formation of a map of communicational semantics of the turkish society. in this respect, we browsed the proverbs and idioms dictionary of the turkish language association for certain words and conducted thematic analysis of the 77 proverbs that were found in this relation. we found that while many proverbs exerted the importance of verbal communication in relation to the attributes of the utterance and it 's implications; many other proverbs exhibited a rhetoric that affirmed nonverbal communication acts like silence, listening, and reticence. on the other hand, proverbs on visual communication featured messages that proposed that people should not be judged over their appearance and dressing.
nonverbal_communication	eyes play an important role in expressing emotions in nonverbal communication. in the present study, emotional expression classification was performed based on the features that were automatically extracted from the eye area. first, the face area and the eye area were automatically extracted from the captured image. afterwards, the parameters to be used for the analysis through discrete wavelet transformation were obtained from the eye area. using these parameters, emotional expression analysis was performed through artificial intelligence techniques. as the result of the experimental studies, 6 universal emotions consisting of expressions of happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, anger and fear were classified at a success rate of 84% using artificial neural networks.
nonverbal_communication	although patients may raise new concerns during any time of the medical visit, the closing phase of the consultation is a critical locus for the negotiation of the topicalization of additional concerns. using conversation analysis as the primary method of analysis, this study provides an analysis of the structure of consultation ""closings"" in korean primary-care encounters and the way in which the organization of closings in this context discourages patients' presentation of additional concerns. data are drawn from 60 videotaped primary-care encounters collected from korea, between 2007 and 2008. the rare occasions in which last-minute concerns are raised are closely analyzed to reveal that the organization of gaze and body orientation play an important role in foreclosing the presentation of additional concerns. the results contribute to our understanding of closings in the primary-care interview by investigating a non-western setting that includes an investigation of an understudied subject - that of embodied resources - and shows how these closings serve the doctor 's purpose of bringing closure in the face of last-minute concerns broached by the patient. the cultural meaning of gaze in the korean medical care context is also discussed. the findings have implications for research on nonverbal communication, cultural differences, and interactions in medical care.

nonverbal_communication	the goal of the present paper was to investigate whether soccer referees' nonverbal behavior (nvb) differed based on the difficulty of their decisions and whether perceivers could detect these systematic variations. on the one hand, communicating confidence via nvb is emphasized in referee training. on the other hand, it seems feasible from a theoretical point of view that particularly following relatively difficult decisions referees have problems controlling their nvb. we conducted three experiments to investigate this question. experiment 1 (n = 40) and experiment 2 (n = 60) provided evidence that perceivers regard referees' nvb as less confident following ambiguous decisions as compared with following unambiguous decisions. experiment 3 (n = 58) suggested that perceivers were more likely to debate with the referee when referees nonverbally communicated less confidence. we discuss consequences for referee training.
nonverbal_communication	research on the visual and nonverbal aspects of political communication is experiencing a renaissance of sorts, expanding the boundaries of an already innovative and dynamic branch of cross-disciplinary scholarship. the articles assembled in this special issue represent the breadth of work now occurring at this vibrant crossroads of scholarly inquiry. this introduction discusses each contribution while providing an overview of the entire issue.
nonverbal_communication	aims and objectives. to describe how tracheostomised patients in intensive care experience acts of communication and to better understand their experiences in the context of the transitions theory. background. waking up in an intensive care unit unable to speak because of mechanical ventilation can be challenging. communication aids are available, but patients still report difficulties communicating. investigating how mechanically ventilated patients experience communication in the context of the transitions theory might elucidate new ways of supporting them during their transitions while being ventilated. design. a qualitative, descriptive design. methods. eleven patients who had previously been tracheostomised in an intensive care unit were included in this quality improvement project conducted in a university hospital in norway. participants were tracheostomised from 3-27 days. semistructured interviews were conducted from june 2013-august 2013, 318 months after hospital discharge. transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. results. participants reported a great diversity of emotions and experiences attempting to communicate while being tracheostomised. one overarching theme emerging from the analysis was the 'experience of caring and understanding despite having uncomfortable feelings due to troublesome communication.' the theme consists of three categories. the category 'emotionally challenging' shows that patients struggled initially. with time, their coping improved, as revealed in the category 'the experience changes with time.' despite difficulties, participants described positive experiences, as shown in the category 'successful communication.' conclusion. the importance of patients experiencing caring and understanding despite their difficult situation constitutes the core finding. the findings suggest that participants went through different transitions. some reached the end of their transition, experiencing increased stability. relevance to clinical practice. despite challenges with communication, participants reported that caring and safety provided by health care professionals were significant experiences. they viewed nonverbal communication as being very important.
nonverbal_communication	the present paper focuses on how nonverbal communication elements are correlated with leadership behaviours of military junior leaders and how these constructs affect the superior performance of their followers. our data show that the facial expression (smile) and the eye behaviour are the ones that have a positive and most pronounced correlation with the subordinate 's perception of self-confidence, self-control, courage, empathy, and influence / reference of their commanders. the factors ""extraordinary effort"" and ""satisfaction"" are also positively related. on the contrary, gestures such as ""crossed arms"" and ""point one 's finger"" have a negative correlation with the subordinate 's perception of ""self-confidence"", ""self-control"", ""courage"", ""empathy"", and ""influence /reference"" of their commanders. in this case, the factors ""extraordinary effort"" and ""satisfaction"" are also negatively related. we conclude that the use of certain gestures may contribute to a positive or negative perception of a commander by his followers thereby influencing their performance.
nonverbal_communication	children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) require substantial support to address the core symptoms of asd and co-occurring behavioral/developmental conditions. this study explores the early diagnostic experiences of school-aged children with asd using survey data from a large probability-based national sample. multivariate linear regressions were used to examine age when parent reported developmental concern to doctor, received asd diagnosis, and first obtained services. children whose parents had concerns about their child 's verbal communication reported earlier ages for all outcomes when compared to children of parents who did not have verbal communication concerns. children whose parents had concerns about their child 's nonverbal communication or unusual gestures/ movements received an earlier diagnosis than children whose parents did not have these specific concerns.
nonverbal_communication	a conceptual model is proposed that explains how gene environment correlations and the multiplier effect function in the context of social development in individuals with autism. the review discusses the current state of autism genetic research, including its challenges, such as the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the disorder, and its limitations, such as the lack of interdisciplinary work between geneticists and social scientists. we discuss literature on gene environment correlations in the context of social development and draw implications for individuals with autism. the review expands upon genes, behaviors, types of environmental exposure, and exogenous variables relevant to social development in individuals on the autism spectrum, and explains these factors in the context of the conceptual model to provide a more in-depth understanding of how the effects of certain genetic variants can be multiplied by the environment to cause largely phenotypic individual differences. using the knowledge gathered from gene environment correlations and the multiplier effect, we outline novel intervention directions and implications.
leadership	multigene testing for breast cancer recurrence risk became available in 2007, yet many eligible patients remain untested. this study evaluated variation in testing rates, and oncologist and organizational factors associated with variation, in a setting without financial influences on testing. we conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic data and oncologist surveys within kaiser permanente northern california, a large integrated health care system. analyses included all 2974 test eligible patients from 2013 to 2015, 113 oncologists, and 15 practice groups. receipt of multigene testing was evaluated with generalized linear mixed models. overall, 39% of eligible patients had multigene testing, but rates varied widely among practice groups, ranging from 24 to 48% after case mix adjustment. this 24% difference among practices was greater than the variation associated with most patient characteristics, including comorbidities and race/ethnicity, and similar to that associated with tumor size. practice group and oncologist factors were statistically significant contributors to the variation in testing after adjusting for patient factors. patients were more likely to be tested if they had a female oncologist (aor 1.60, 95% ci 1.21-2.12) or were in a practice whose chief had a high testing rate (aor 1.20, 95% ci 1.12-1.29 per 10% increase in the percent tested). oncologist and leadership practices play a key role in the variation in genomic test use for cancer recurrence risk even in a healthcare system without financial barriers to testing and could be a leverage point for implementing desired practice changes for new genomic advances.
leadership	a wealth of governance research has examined ceo successions and the negative organizational consequences that arise when boards are unable to effect smooth leadership transitions. despite those findings, empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that disruptive successions are still very common. in this article, we investigate whether disruptive ceo successions are viewed as a governance lapse by the board. we focus specifically on succession processes that involve the use of an interim leader. we leverage established research that shows that the pattern of board turnover observed in the wake of negative events is indicative of whether board behaviors are-in practice-viewed as normative violations. we theorize that audiences will disapprove of boards' use of interim ceos and, therefore, expect that these successions will prompt higher rates of board turnover than those observed following noninterim successions. however, we also anticipate that this relationship will be moderated by situational characteristics (e.g., surprise ceo departure, dynamic industry environment) that complicate succession planning and make audiences more accepting of a board 's decision to rely on an interim ceo. our analysis of 438 successions at publicly traded u.s. firms provides support for these arguments. we discuss the implications of our findings for successions and corporate governance.
leadership	the vision for science teaching in the framework for k-12 science education and the next generation science standards requires a radical departure from traditional science teaching. science literacy is defined as three-dimensional (3d), in which students engage in science and engineering practices to develop and apply science disciplinary ideas and crosscutting concepts. this knowledge building presents many challenges for teachers. we describe a two-pronged program for scaling 3d science professional development (pd) across a state: (a) 24 teachers developed expertise in 3d learning and facilitating teacher study groups; (b) these peer facilitators led 22 study groups of teachers in 3d science activities, analyzing student learning, and investigating classroom interactions. we describe design approaches for supporting teacher and facilitator learning. we present analyses of teacher learning, including shifts in 3d science, beliefs, and pedagogical content knowledge that supports 3d science teaching, and consider implications for scalable design approaches for supporting science teacher learning.
leadership	most research into emotional labour is focussed on front-line service staff and health professionals, in short-term interactions. little exists exploring the emotional labour involved in repeated on-going interactions by educational leaders with key stakeholders. this study explored the relationships between emotional demands, three emotional labour facets, burnout, wellbeing and job satisfaction in 1320 full-time school principals. principals displayed significantly higher scores on emotional demands at work, burnout and job satisfaction, and significantly lower wellbeing scores than the general population. structural equation modelling revealed that emotional demands predicted the elevated use of all emotional labour strategies. surface acting-hiding emotions had an inverse relationship with burnout, wellbeing and job satisfaction. surface acting-faking emotions had an inverse relationship with job satisfaction. deep acting demonstrated no significant associations with outcome variables. the findings of this study extend the current literature on the effects of emotional labour. the study also extends understanding about the separate effects of the facets of emotional labour, which will aid in the development of interventions to reduce high levels of burnout reported by educational leaders.
leadership	the current business market is characterized by rapid and continuous changes. companies should adapt to new situations to guarantee sustainable development. managers need to have capabilities to understand the new environment 's requirements. managers' individual dynamic capabilities (idc) help them face these unpredictable changes in the market. however, few authors have analysed individual dynamic capabilities to ensure business sustainability. this study aims to shed light on the relationship between a manager 's idc and business sustainability from a gender perspective. a survey of 339 managers was conducted, and structural equation modelling (sem) was applied to study the impact of the relationship. the results show that managers' individual dynamic capabilities help them detect changes in the market earlier and promote a greater social and environmental commitment from those managers. in addition, significant differences in the environmental and social commitment between men and women were found. therefore, this paper first provides advice for developing business sustainability to provide an advantage for organizations. second, individual dynamic managerial capabilities appear to be important for promoting sustainability. finally, another step in the construction of gender and sustainability is provided. thus, this paper provides useful empirical evidence for managerial practice from a strategic management viewpoint.

leadership	high maternal mortality ratios (mmrs) serve as objective indicators of the poor condition of women 's health in any country and point to violations of human rights that are entrenched in national, regional, and global laws. for more than a decade, nigeria has consistently been one of the top five listed countries with the highest mmrs in the world; in 2015, its mmr was estimated at 814 deaths per 100000 live births, accounting for 19% of maternal deaths worldwide and approximately 58000 deaths each year. accountability for preventable maternal deaths and injuries is essential to both achieve and sustain a reduction in nigeria 's high levels of maternal mortality. the present article addresses key human rights strategies for securing accountability, and identifies opportunities for healthcare providers to have leadership roles in the fulfilment of legal and ethical obligations to preserve women 's lives.
leadership	purpose the purpose of this research is to investigate how organizations can best facilitate an empowered workforce that makes autonomous decisions and acts expediently, which the literature on high performing organizations posits will increase the likelihood of sustained performance and retaining competitive advantages. we introduce a novel mechanism for encouraging such behaviors and pursuant outcomes: vicarious learning from a supervisor who demonstrates autonomy and expediency. design/methodology/approach we drew experimental data from a sample of participants who underwent a managerial simulation, and used these data to investigate relationships between the vicarious learning of empowered behaviors and individual task performance (n = 100). findings results indicate that when supervisors behave with autonomy and expediency this both increases the extent to which individuals behave similarly, and is associated with enhanced individual performance. further, we find that expedient behavior fully mediates the relationship between empowered supervisor behavior and performance. implications findings show that supervisors need not necessarily engage directly in empowering others. rather, by modeling behaviors, supervisors can craft a context where employees may act with autonomy and efficiency. this provides an opportunity for empowerment that is both actionable and cost-effective. originality/value this is the first study to consider empowerment as a managerial phenomenon that can be vicariously learned, integrating theories of social learning and empowerment, and extending existing empowerment constructs (including psychological and structural) to develop an indirect, yet potent means of encouraging empowered behavior.
leadership	aimimplementation of an intervention can result in a discrepancy between what was planned and what is delivered, affecting outcomes for recipients. the aim was to explore, from the perspective of hospital foodservice staff, their experiences delivering a nutrition intervention and the barriers and enablers to its implementation. methodsa process evaluation of a pilot study was undertaken using qualitative description. a purposive sample (n = 15) of hospital foodservice supervisors and foodservice assistants responsible for delivering a higher energy menu to hospital patients participated in focus groups and semistructured interviews. theoretical frameworks of behaviour underpinned the method. content analysis elicited factors (sub-themes) influencing foodservice staff 's capability, opportunity and motivation to provide the nutrition intervention. thematic analysis (by two independent researchers) further explored factors (themes) related to the process of the intervention 's implementation. resultsfive key themes (and 15 sub-themes) explained factors effecting implementation of the nutrition intervention. aspects of the foodservice environment and patients' resistance were barriers to implementation and perceived sustainability. teamwork, problem solving, leadership and job satisfaction were enablers. there was an opportunity to optimise training and feedback. characteristics of foodservice staff, including their: knowledge, beliefs and perceptions of diet, health and their job role, had the potential to influence their behaviours and decision making. conclusionsa number of interacting factors influenced foodservice staff 's delivery of a higher energy menu as planned. addressing the challenges of time, foodservice structure, patients' resistance, gaps in knowledge and misconceptions among foodservice staff may enhance similar nutrition interventions in the future.
leadership	this article aims, first, to argue that fandom matters to politics and, second, to offer a theorisation of what i call politicised fandom. the article proceeds through three stages. part 1 offers a brief mapping of the existing scholarship within the interdisciplinary sub-field of fan studies and alights on a definition of fandom offered by cornel sandvoss, before mapping some different understandings of the fandom-politics relation. here, i argue for an emphasis on the agency and capacity of fan communities to intervene politically. part 2 then provides an initial theorisation of politicised fandom, highlighting four key elements: productivity and consumption, community, affect and contestation. part 3 offers some snapshots of how this politicised fandom is manifest empirically via the analysis of three similar yet different instances of politicised fandom in uk left politics: russell brand, milifandom and corbyn-mania.
leadership	we explore how formal managers' centralities in both positive and negative networks predict followers' perceptions of their leadership. by incorporating social networks and social ledger theory with implicit leadership theories (ilt5), we hypothesize that formally assigned group leaders (managers) who have more positive advice ties and fewer negative avoidance ties are more likely to be recognized as leaders by their followers. further, we posit that managers' informal networks bring them greater social power, an important attribute differentiating leaders from non -leaders. we conducted two survey-based studies in student and field teams to test the hypotheses. based on nested data in both studies, we found support for our hypotheses. these results remain robust across the two studies even though they used different designs (cross-sectional versus longitudinal), different samples (field versus students) across different countries (united states versus india), and a host of control variables at both the leader and follower levels. we find that managers who are central in the advice network are socially powerful and are seen as leaders by individual followers. in contrast, managers who are avoided by followers lack informal social power are not seen as leaders. we conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings and the ways in which our theory and results extend ilts and social network theory.

child_abuse	this article provides an overview of the witch-hunt narrative, focusing on the challenges of gathering information from young children, such as those involved in sexual abuse allegations in day care. the article summarizes the research methodology of the witch-hunt narrative, which involves a series of case studies. the article articulates cheit 's hypothesis, which is that the witch-hunt narrative originated in two key publications, a series of articles by two journalists, tom charlier and shirley dowling, and the book, satan 's silence: ritual abuse and the making of a modern-day witch-hunt, by debbie nathan and michael snedeker, and notes his disputes with the evidence from these two publications. cheit deals in depth with three hotly contested day care center cases: the mcmartin pre-school case in manhattan beach, california, the wee care day nursery case in maplewood, new jersey, and the country walk babysitting service case in dade county, florida. the article summarizes cheit 's research and conclusions related to these three cases and also notes how forensic interview practices used in these cases would not be supported today. the article concludes with noting that despite the impressive progress in forensic interviewing of children when sexual abuse is alleged, methods for gathering information from young children remain inadequate. moreover, there are no easy answers to the reasons for the rise and fall of allegations of sexual abuse in day care and of allegations of ritual abuse.
child_abuse	no specific pathognomonic tissue changes establish death from water intoxication, which makes a postmortem diagnosis of water intoxication difficult. we report an autopsy case of fatal water intoxication in which the postmortem computed tomography (pmct) examination showed findings suggestive of antemortem excessive water drinking, such as diluted intestinal contents and hemodilution. a 52-year-old man who had schizophrenia was found dead in his house. he frequently complained of polydipsia, and drank a large amount of water and vomited before his death. pmct findings showed distention of the duodenum with low radiodensity content (7 hu). in addition, the right atrium showed a low radiodensity content (46 hu). autopsy results showed moderate congestion in all the organs, a large amount of light-brownish liquid in the duodenum and upper jejunum, and aspiration pneumonia. electrolyte concentrations of sodium in the vitreous humor of the right and left eyes were 105 and 107 meq/l, respectively, and neither drugs nor alcohol was detected in the blood. on the basis of the autopsy and biochemical findings, we determined water intoxication as the cause of death. an evaluation of pmct findings of cases of various causes of death indicated that the radiodensities of the right atrium and duodenal content in our case were lower than those of the cases of various causes of death, except for fresh water drowning. the present case showed that pmct provides supplementary findings regarding antemortem excessive water drinking. in addition, pmct may provide findings to consider death from water intoxication before autopsy.
child_abuse	undergraduate medical curricula typically include forensic and legal medicine topics that are of a highly sensitive nature. examples include suicide, child abuse, domestic and sexual violence. it is likely that some students will have direct or indirect experience of these issues which are prevalent in society. those students are vulnerable to vicarious harm from partaking in their medical education. even students with no direct or indirect experience of these issues may be vulnerable to vicarious trauma, particularly students who are especially empathetic to cases presented. despite these risks, instruction relating to these topics is necessary to ensure the competencies of graduating doctors to respond appropriately to cases they encounter during their professional careers. however, risk can be minimised by a well-designed and thoughtfully delivered educational programme. we provide recommendations for the successful inclusion of sensitive forensic and legal medicine topics in undergraduate medical curricula.

child_abuse	child maltreatment most often occurs within the family and is often an expression of the inability of parents to cope with the child 's needs. parental distress results in inadequate, conscious or unconscious but never accidental overreactions, resulting in severe physical and psychological sequelae. furthermore, the individual and healthcare costs to society are extensive; therefore, early identification of children and adolescents at risk is of paramount importance and due to the position of trust in relationship to families, pediatricians play an important role. the recommended preventive medical check-ups are regular contacts, which provide the opportunity for early recognition of child maltreatment and implementation of measures to prevent further harm. knowledge of risk factors, potential triggers and availability of community programs and resources to help affected families are indispensable prerequisites.
child_abuse	objectives. - the link parent-child is central in the construction of the young subject. this link can be put in distress when the adult suffers from psychiatric disorders and become toxic. this article proposes a reflection on the impacts of adult 's serious psychological troubles on the child and a discussion about the existing tension between psychiatric care for the parent and the measures of help and protection towards the child. method. - to try to define all the elements of answer, the authors lean on their experience in a multidisciplinary team compound of social workers, psychologists, a jurist and doctors (pediatrician and child psychiatrist) asked for 30 years to realize the diagnostic and therapeutic care of situations of ill-treatments of children and teenagers. we met different situations involving parents and children within the framework of our process of multidisciplinary evaluation. we also base ourselves on a work of network, discussing with our colleagues in charge of the therapeutic support of the adult patients. results. - the processes of evaluation between the looks of the professionals close to the child and those who meet the parents in their adult 's suffering allowed to seize all the relevance to go out of an simplistic reading to understand the ins and outs which led to ill treatment. discussion. - in spite, of the concern of the respect for every protagonist concerned in a holistic understanding of his course of life, we are confronted with the limits of our mission, on one hand, and what bases the therapeutic link on the other hand. it is so, for example, that the question of the shared professional secretly represents a stumbling block which can affect the process of evaluation and support in his purpose. conclusion. - the clinical experience and the theoretical reflections confirm the interest of a complex multidisciplinary work, integrating the contributions of the visions of the professional asked to estimate and to accompany, on one hand, the child, and on the other hand, the parent.

child_abuse	backgroundthere have been no previous studies on the adequacy of combined evaluation of possible abusive head trauma cases by frontline medical personnel, hospital-based child protection teams, and child protective services in local districts of japan. methodswe conducted a questionnaire survey of hospitalized patients under 24months old with a diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage (ich) from january 2011 to december 2013. eleven large-scale general hospitals in yokohama, japan were surveyed, which provide centralized inpatient care to moderately-severely ill children. resultsa total of 51 ich patients were listed from eight hospitals. median patient age was 7months, and 84% were younger than 12months. the most common diagnosis on computed tomography was subdural hematoma (n=26; 51%). of a total of 51 cases, 31 (61%) occurred inside the home; the injury scene was unknown in six cases (12%). we reviewed these 37 cases from the viewpoint of evaluation with concern for suspected child abuse. three out of 37 patients (8%) were not examined for inflicted skin lesions, and skeletal surveys and funduscopy were not conducted in 14 (38%) and 15 (41%), respectively. thirteen out of 37 cases (35%) were not reported to hospital-based child protection teams and 22 (59%) were not reported to regional child protective services. conclusionthe sociomedical evaluation of possible child abuse appears to be systematically inadequate in yokohama.
child_abuse	criminal justice research frequently investigates relationships between punishment decisions and demographic characteristics of the accused, such as gender, race, and age. while there are many similarities between criminal justice and child welfare cases, research on child maltreatment has yet to examine potential demographic influences on case outcomes. the current study examines relationships between parent gender, type of maltreatment, and child removal among agency responses to child maltreatment cases. using data collected by the national data archive on child abuse and neglect data system (ncands), we identify differences in the likelihood of child removal from the parental home across type of maltreatment and perpetrator gender. our results indicate that mother perpetrators of physical abuse not only face significantly higher likelihood of removal than mother perpetrators of neglect, but are more at risk for losing their children than father perpetrators of both physical abuse and neglect. findings suggest that gendered attributions and stereotypes regarding parenting can shape assessments of parents' blameworthiness, dangerousness, and rehabilitative potential. we propose that future research on child maltreatment cases adapt and apply justice concepts and frameworks to uncover potential unwarranted demographic disparities in agency decision-making.

child_abuse	child protection and welfare have become international issues in a globalized world. ideas about childhood and the upbringing of children vary widely, depending upon the prevailing economic, socio-cultural, religious, and political contexts. these have had dramatic effects on the way societies value children, and the role acquired by the state in their protection and advancing their well-being. children, however, remain at risk. they are placed at risk by the breakdown of extended family systems as a result of urbanization, and as a result of impaired functioning of some nuclear families, in the absence of kinship safety nets. some traditional cultural practices place children at risk, especially girl children. poverty creates risks for all children but it can create specific catastrophic risks for girls. countries can enact visionary laws intended to protect children, but they will be ineffective against entrenched social attitudes, especially if only limited resources can be provided to implement and enforce them. this is the ultimate challenge that the world community must address if the vision of the united nations convention on the rights of the child is to be realized.
child_abuse	interpreters play a crucial role in many investigative interviews with child complainants of sexual abuse; however, little has been written about the interpreting process from the perspective of the interviewers. this study elicited interviewers' perspectives about the challenges of using interpreters, with the aim of understanding how investigative interviews could be improved. the participants consisted of 21 investigative interviewers and prosecutors of child abuse cases (from a range of jurisdictions) who use interpreters on a regular basis. thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the professionals about the interpreting process revealed two main challenges particular to child abuse interviews, namely the interpreters' lack of preparedness to deal with the traumatic and sensitive nature of children 's abuse histories, and an insufficient understanding of best-practice' child interview process. the recommendations focus on the need for more specialised training for, and screening of, interpreters, and more extensive use of pre-conferencing to familiarise children with the interpreter-mediated interview process.
child_abuse	the gender of the offender has been proved to be an important factor in judicial sentencing. in this study, we analyze the judgments of college students regarding perpetrators of familial homicides to evaluate the presence of these gender norms and biases in the larger society. the sample included 303 college students (54.8% female) enrolled in several social sciences and engineering courses. participants were asked to read 12 vignettes based on real crimes taken from portuguese newspapers. half were related to infanticide, and half were related to intimate partner homicide. the sex of the offender was orthogonally manipulated to the type of crime. the results show that gender had an important impact on sentences, with males being more harshly penalized by reasons of perversity and women less penalized by reason of mental disorders. in addition, filicide was more heavily penalized than was intimate partner homicide. the results also revealed a tendency toward a retributive conception of punishment. we discuss how gender norms in justice seem to be embedded in society as well as the need for intervention against the punitive tendency of this population.
gender_roles	background: worldwide, infertility affects 10%-15% of couples and most of them seek medical help including assisted reproductive technology (art) treatments. undergoing art treatments create many physical and emotional burdens. this study examined the psychological consequences of infertility in iranian infertile males and females as well as their spouses, unlike previous studies that examined mainly females with infertility. methods: subjects in this descriptive analytical design were recruited from the ivf department of mirza koochak khan hospital and the rouyesh infertility treatment center of tehran, iran between aug 2014 and sep 2015. overall, 256 couples (64% response rate), consisting of 78 infertile male and their spouses and 50 infertile female and their spouses, were included in this research. the psychological disorders were measured by the persian version of symptoms checklist-90-revised and cattle inventory. results: psychological disorders of infertile couples are significantly associated with increasing age, higher education, longer duration of infertility and unemployment (p<0.05). prevalence of anxiety, depression, hypochondriasis and paranoia in infertile females and spouses of infertile males were significantly higher than husbands of infertile females (p<0.05). obsession was more sever in infertile females was significantly greater than infertile males (p=0.01). depression was significantly lower in infertile males than their spouses (p=0.016). conclusion: iranian infertile females and spouses of infertile males experienced more psychological disorders than infertile males and spouses of infertile females. these results may be due to the impact of cultural beliefs and gender roles in iranian society. anxiety, depression, obsession, paranoia and hypochondriasis should be addressed before any art treatments.
gender_roles	the position of women in society, women 's role in society has always been debated along with men. in turkey as well, there has been a lot of discussion on the women 's social position. the main aim of this study is to evaluate women 's issues in the context of gender roles by focusing on the novels of three writers from different periods of turkish political history. in this study, first the ottoman era writer fatma aliye hanim 's novel muhederat, then the rebuplican era writer adalet agaoglu 's novel olmeye yatmak, finally contemporary writer ayfer tunc 's novel yesil peri gecesi were analyzed over the gender roles of their characters. only one novel of each writer was chosen not to exceed the time limit of the congress report. in the scope of this research, a literature review was done and it was observed from the works reviewed that, in general, comments was made about single period of time. moreover, the purpose of addressing different time periods is to examine changes in women 's issues throughout the history and changes in the social structure over the concepts such as female-male relations, family, social gender, work, politics and freedom, through the characters of novels. even though, women 's problems still exist, the results indicate that women have changed the social perception by increasing awareness, as a result of their effort. in conclusion, this paper facilitates understanding by providing an opportunity to compare the social opinion of three writers from different periods and by showing the progress which writers have made. providing an opportunity for interdisciplinary vision, literature and social structure can also provide convenience for researchers from different disciplines in their future studies.
gender_roles	a large number of scholars involved in producing english as a foreign language/english as a second language (efl/esl) materials hold that gender roles and representations can either motivate or de-motivate students when they are learning a foreign language such as english. ever since the day scholars have pinpointed the importance of gender in efl/esl textbooks, a number of studies have been carried out to uncover the biases imbedded intentionally or unintentionally in different english textbooks taught all over the world. linked to previous studies, the current study is aimed at investigating how social gender identity is defined via adjectives and photos used in world english series published by cengage heinle publication. to this end, the common adjectives used in the conversation section of world english 1 have been detected and counted. then they were shown in relevant tables using frequencies. moreover, the photos all extracted from national geographic have been tested against gender biases. the results of the study show that world english 1 tries to show both men and women equally, albeit some instances of biases have been found in the photos. the results of the study can be used by syllabus designers, materials developers and efl/esl teachers who are interested in textbook analysis as well as gender biases.
gender_roles	we examined culturally relevant gender differences in the attachment dimensions and their dyadic associations with relationship functioning using a large sample (n = 1228). considering that attachment avoidance is culturally incongruent with turkish culture and there exist a sharp gender role difference in marriage, we anticipated that avoidance for women and anxiety for men would be strong dyadic predictors of satisfaction and conflict among married couples. dyadic analyses revealed that attachment dimensions which are incongruent with cultural characteristics and gender roles predicted marital conflict and satisfaction. avoidance, but not anxiety, had both actor and partner effects on marital satisfaction. attachment anxiety of husbands, but not wives, was linked with marital conflict. attachment avoidance seems to be a primary risk factor for satisfaction and attachment anxiety for conflict in the turkish cultural context.
gender_roles	a systematic review of scientific articles about violence against women and / or situations where women are treated under the traditional prism of gender roles in spanish films is presented in this investigation, allowing these situations that aggressive acts remain framed, exclusively, in the domestic sphere. surprisingly, in all articles and film reviews that focus on women roles and / or women violence, the famous film amanece, que no es poco by jose luis cuerda is not even mentioned as a simple example of spanish film where gender violence is evident.
gender_roles	although benevolent sexism (bs)-an ideology that highly reveres women who conform to traditional gender roles-is cloaked in a superficially positive tone, being placed upon a pedestal is inherently restrictive. accordingly, because the paternalistic beliefs associated with bs are based on the idealization of traditional gender roles (which include motherhood), bs should predict people 's attitudes toward women 's reproductive rights. using data from a nationwide longitudinal panel study (n = 12,299), study 1 showed that bs (but not hostile sexism) had cross-lagged effects on opposition to both elective and traumatic abortion. study 2 (n = 309) extended these findings by showing that the relationship between bs and support for abortion was fully mediated by attitudes toward motherhood. these results highlight the pernicious nature of bs by demonstrating that the idealization of women-and motherhood, in particular-comes at a substantial cost (namely, the restriction of women 's reproductive rights).
gender_roles	a mix of fantasy, history, spirituality, and political engagement, elvira giallanella 's film, umanita (1920), is a sort of carrollian 'through the looking glass' in which reality resembles itself but upside-down. in the immediate aftermath of wwi, giallanella 's film - a revision of vittorio emanuele bravetta 's 1916 children 's story from 1916 children 's story - both reflects and critiques gender roles that had been temporarily fissured by the war itself. a feminist position transpires in the juxtaposition of the pre-war male-authored text with the postwar female-directed film, further revised by men. an invaluable historical source, umanita not only offers insight into a woman 's and a feminist 's perspective on the great war and its aftermath but also sheds light on the moral, political, and philosophical atmosphere of destabilization at the time. coming full circle, umanita suffered from the very same revisions by the re-established postwar patriarchy, and by the end of the 1920s, cinema itself had been reclaimed as male territory, leaving the film lost amongst the debris. umanita 's resurfacing in 2007 allows us to reflect on the process of history-making in itself: what is omitted, what is included, and more importantly whose voices will be validated enough to be heard along the way. this instance - one amongst several - can serve as an example of how history is indeed a continuous process made up of (re)visions, and never a singular, univocal one.
gender_roles	enga tradition provides the ideal of a man who learned discipline mainly through initiation, and who lived independently from women while realising that he depended on women to make him who he was. in recent decades there have been radical transformations in enga society, which have meant considerable change in men 's construction of identity. when their sons appear no longer to listen to them, older men wonder if they are the last of the real men. younger men today face the prospect of having to invent new ways to achieve recognition as men. in today 's world relying on money for masculine status, there is greater social stratification in which some will succeed and many not. this affects men 's identity and the quality of their relationship with women. despite sexual emancipation and changes in the understanding of marriage, gendered role expectations continue to find a place in most marriages; not meeting those expectations may generate tensions that can easily lead to verbal and physical violence.
gender_roles	purpose - knowledge and technology transfer (ktt) and particularly academic entrepreneurship (klofsten and jones-evans, 2000) are indispensable for economic growth and wealth creation. in many european countries including germany, substantially fewer women than men participate in ktt. recently, decision makers from scientific, political, and commercial organisations have increased their attention to the gender dimension (e.g. moser, 2007; schiebinger, 2013). the purpose of this paper is to evaluate in what ways and to what degree gender is currently integrated in german ktt. design/methodology/approach - by following an abductive approach (suddaby, 2006) and building upon existing models (klofsten and jones-evans, 2000; carlsson et al., 2002; lundvall, 2010), the authors developed an analytical framework for evaluating the position of the gender dimension in ktt, conducted a comprehensive literature review, and 22 key informant interviews. findings - the findings indicate that the gender dimension is barely integrated in german ktt, which particularly manifests itself through the fact that there are fewer than 10 per cent women among academic entrepreneurs. current organisational practices and attitudes of decision makers continue to reinforce traditional gender roles and ""typically male"" approaches and behaviours (connell, 2005; redien-collot, 2009). originality/value - the authors were the first to synthesise a variety of sources into one unified framework and to rigorously analyse the gender dimension in german ktt - both quantitatively and qualitatively and on different levels. this framework can help decisions makers, both in- and outside of germany, re-envision ktt practices, and create new opportunities for its diverse participants.
gender_roles	improve the quality of life is one of the main concerns of the public agenda of cities around the world. the quality of life is closely related to the satisfaction of daily needs of people and how these needs are satisfied is not neutral. the needs of men and women are different as a result of gender roles. androcentric urban architecture contributes to satisfying the needs of women and men is asymmetrical so that the quality of city life is not fair. the following article reflects on the concept of quality of life from urban dimension and the impact of gender in the definition and measurement of that term.
depression	the lateral ponticle and epitransverse process are rare anatomical variations found on the atlas vertebra of the cervical spine. when a lateral ponticle occurs, an abnormal bony bridge extends from the superior articular facet to the transverse process. this bony bridge bisects the transverse foramen wherein the vertebral artery normally lies. in this case report, we describe a c1 specimen from an adult male with a lateral ponticle on the right side and an epitransverse process on the left side. additionally, an articular facet-like structure was also found on the lateral ponticle 's surface. relevant literature regarding the lateral ponticle across age groups, sex, race, and species is also reviewed. we postulate that genesis of the lateral ponticle of the atlas occurs in utero, specifically during the lateral ossification of the ventral sclerotomes. to our knowledge, an articular facet-like structure on such a ponticle has not been reported previously. moreover, simultaneous occurrence of a lateral ponticle and contralateral epitransverse process has, to our knowledge, not been reported before.
depression	the symptoms of sleep apnea, such as sleep fragmentation and oxygen desaturation, might be risk factors for subsequent mood disorder (md), but associations between sleep apnea and md remain unclear. this nationwide population-based study thus aimed to identify the risk of md in patients with vs. without sleep apnea. this cohort study used data from the national health insurance database. in total, 5415 patients diagnosed with sleep apnea between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated, and 27,075 matched non-sleep apnea enrollees were included as a comparison cohort. all subjects were followed until 2011. the cox proportional hazard ratio (hr) was used to investigate the relationship between md and sleep apnea while controlling covariates and comorbidities of sleep apnea. of 5415, 154 patients with sleep apnea (2.84 %) were diagnosed with md during the follow-up period in comparison with 306 of 27,075 individuals (1.13 %) without antecedent sleep apnea. after adjusting for the selected factors and comorbidities, we found that patients with sleep apnea were from 1.82- to 2.07-fold greater risk of md than the comparisons. of the three subcategories of md (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and unspecified md), sleep apnea had the highest predisposing risk with respect to major depressive disorder (adjusted hr from 1.82 to 2.07) and bipolar disorder (adjusted hr from 2.15 to 3.24). there is a greater likelihood of md manifesting in patients with a history of sleep apnea. health professionals are thus advised to carefully monitor the psychological impacts of sleep apnea.
depression	there is wide variation in reported impact of caring on caregiver wellbeing, and often a negative appraisal of caregiving. researchers are beginning to question the robustness of the evidence base on which negative appraisals are based. the present study aimed to draw on data from a population-representative sample to describe the health, quality of life and impact of caring of informal caregivers of people with an intellectual disability. informal carers of people with intellectual disability (n = 260) were identified among 2199 carers in the english survey of carers in households 2009/10. generalised estimating equations explored the association between socio-demographic and caring profile with quality of life, physical health status, and impact on psychological health and personal life. compared to other caregivers, providing care to a person with intellectual disability was not associated with reduced quality of life. there was an 82% increased risk of reporting poorer health status, even though poorer health was not likely to be attributed to caregiving. a higher risk of negative impact on personal life was seen in comparison with the wider group of caregivers, but not in comparison with more similar-sized caregiver groups (mental health or dementia). carers of people with intellectual disability were more likely to be struggling financially and have a high caring load. these factors were systematically related to lower well-being. a uniformly negative appraisal of caring for people with intellectual disability was not supported by these english population-representative data. poverty and long caregiving hours may make caregivers more susceptible to negative wellbeing. support for caregivers of people with intellectual disability should focus on alleviating those two factors.
depression	structural and molecular properties of antidepressants 1-(3-(dimethylamino)propyi)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile were examined using quantum mechanics of density functional theory (dft)/b3lyp and pbepbe methods with 6-311 ++g(d,2p) and lanl2dz basis sets to study the therapeutic properties of the drug. for this, the structure of desired material was optimized by the computer calculation method and with the use of powerful gaussian 09 software. then the lowest energy value and the bond length, bond angle and dihedral angle between its constituent atoms in the crystal structure of the desired material were measured from the optimized values. then the amount of positive and negative charges, polarizability and dipole moment of its atoms using mulliken charge and natural atomic charges, dft/b3lyp and pbepbe methods with 6311 ++ g(d,2p) and lanl2dz basis sets were determined and the results were compared with each other for individual atoms and by mentioned methods. also the type of stretching vibrations and bending vibrations between the constituent atoms of the molecule were specified using mentioned computational methods and ft ir vibrational spectra. the experimental spectrum of this material was taken to determine the functional groups and the computational and experimental values were compared to each other and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) was used to specify the isomer shift between the carbons and protons in the presence of polar and non polar solvents. also natural bond orbital (nbo) was used to determine the type of electron transfers in (sigma ->sigma* and pi ->pi* and lp(1) ->sigma* and lp(2) sigma* and the amount of hardness and softness in molecule was determined using the difference between ionization energy and electron affinity energy in constituent atoms of that molecule in the highest occupied molecular orbital (homo) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (lumo) and in the presence of solvents h2o, ch3cn and c6h12. uv-vis spectrum of the drug was taken using dft/b3lyp and pbepbe methods with 6-311 ++ g(d,2p) and lanl2dz basis sets as well as solvents h2o, ch3cn and c6h12 and the associated transmissions were examined.

depression	background: early adversity is a known risk factor for unipolar depression. we examined the impact of 9 types of early adversity on risk for moderate to severe unipolar depression in adolescence or adulthood, and evaluated whether these effects were moderated by gender and adversity timing. methods: we conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study using danish national registers. the sample included all individuals born in denmark between 1980 and 1998 (n=978,647). exposure to early adversity was assessed from ages 0-15. types of adversity included parental illness, incarceration, death, disability, and psychiatric diagnosis; family disruption; out-of-home care; and childhood abuse. individuals were followed from age 15 until first in- or outpatient depression diagnosis (icd-10 codes f32, f33) in a psychiatric hospital, death, emigration, or december 31st, 2013, whichever came first. hazard ratios (hrs) were calculated using cox regressions. results: all adversities were significantly associated with increased risk for moderate to severe adolescent/adult depression (hr range: 1.30-2.72), although the effects were attenuated after mutual adjustment (adjusted hr range: 1.06-1.70). none of the effects were moderated by gender. the effect of family disruption was strongest between ages 0-4 (hr=1.66, 95% ci=1.61-1.71), while the effect of out-of-home care was strongest between ages 10-14 (hr=2.45, 95% ci=2.28-2.64). limitations: untreated and primary-care treated depression were not measured. conclusions: our results support past findings that multiple types of early adversity increase risk for moderate to severe unipolar depression in adolescence and adulthood. certain adversities may be more harmful if they occur during specific developmental time periods.
depression	farming systems can expose animals to chronic mild stress which is known to induce negative affective state. affective state in animals, as in humans, can be assessed through behavioral cues. this study aimed to describe the effect of a chronic mild stress, known to induce a negative affective state, on sheep health through their response to vaccination. the study used 15 lambs subjected to a model of chronic mild stress for 15 weeks and 15 lambs reared under conventional farming as a control group. after 7 weeks of stressful treatment, the lambs were individually exposed to a judgment bias test to assess a putative stress-induced pessimism.' after 15 weeks of stressful treatment, antibody immune response was measured after an injection of a live vaccine challenge (chlamydia abortus attenuated vaccine strain 1b). stressed lambs displayed a pessimistic-like perception in the judgment bias test, revealing a negative affective state. stressed and control animals showed different immunological reactions to vaccine challenge: stressed sheep had lower hemoglobin concentrations and higher platelet, granulocyte and acute-phase protein concentrations. antibody response induced by the vaccine strain was not different between stressed and control sheep. our results suggest that negative affective state induced by chronic stress treatment may induce a stronger inflammatory response to vaccine challenge in sheep. improvement of animal health may be achieved through consideration of stressors that may affect the emotional and immunological state of sheep.
depression	the association between salivary flow rate (sfr) and depressive symptoms have been inconclusive. the present study aimed to investigate the association between sfr and depressive symptoms with and without adjustment for genetic and family environmental factors. we conducted a cross-sectional study using twins and measured sfr and depressive symptoms as the outcome and explanatory variables, respectively. we also performed three-step regression analyses by first analysing the association between sfr and depressive symptoms without adjustment for genetic and family environmental factors (individual-level analyses). we then performed between-within analyses using monozygotic (mz) and same-sex dizygotic (dz) twin pairs, and finally using only mz twin pairs. these between-within analyses estimated the coefficients adjusted for genetic and family environmental factors. furthermore, differences in the associations between individual-level and between-within suggest confounding by genetic and family environmental factors. we conducted 448 twins aged ae20 years. in individual-level analyses in males and between-within analyses using mz and same-sex dz male twin pairs, sfr associated with depressive symptoms. in between-within analyses using only mz male twin pairs, sfr did not associate with depressive symptoms. in females, sfr did not associate with depressive symptoms in both individual-level and between-within analyses. the present study revealed that the association between sfr and depressive symptoms was affected by common genetic factors in males. understanding this association between sfr and depressive symptoms with adjustment for genetic and family environmental factors could lead to an important consideration for the prevention and treatment of hyposalivation.
depression	simultaneous relief of the pain from body and brain remains an ongoing challenge. the aim of the present study was to clarify whether plant-derived isoflavone puerarin could ameliorate comorbid depression and pain. we investigated the effects of puerarin on depressive-like behaviors and neuropathic pain in c57bl/6 n mice with spared nerve injury (sni). after sni surgery, mice were allowed to recover spontaneously for 7 days and subsequently treated with puerarin, anti-depressant citalopram, and analgesic ibuprofen, alone or in combination, for 8 or 14 days. forced swim test and tail suspension test were used to assess depressive-like behaviors, whereas von frey filament test was used to estimate the sensitivity to the mechanical stimulation. our results suggested that puerarin effectively ameliorated depression and pain in sni mice although citalopram exhibited anti-depressant activity. in contrast, ibuprofen showed lesser activities against sni-induced depression and pain. further mechanistic studies revealed the uniqueness of puerarin as follows: (1) puerarin did not recover sni-induced depletion of reduced glutathione and loss of superoxide dismutase (sod), whereas citalopram and ibuprofen showed somewhat antioxidant activities; (2) puerarin markedly promoted the activation of creb pathway although puerarin and citalopram activated erk pathway to the same extent; (3) puerarin rapidly and persistently induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) expression whereas citalopram only induced bdnf expression after a prolonged stimulation. collectively, these results suggest that puerarin may ameliorate the sni-induced depression and pain via activating erk, creb, and bdnf pathways. puerarin may serve as new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics for depression and pain comorbidity.
depression	late-life depression (lld) is a common emotional and mental disability in the elderly population characterized by the presence of depressed mood, the loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and other depression symptoms. it has a serious effect on the quality of life of elderly individuals and increases their risk of developing physical and mental diseases. it is an important area of research, given the growing elderly population. brain functional connectivity modifications represent one of the neurobiological biomarker for lld even if to date remains poorly understood. in our study, we enrolled 10 elderly patients with depressive symptoms compared to 11 age-matched healthy controls. all participants were evaluated by means of neuropsychological tests and underwent the same functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) protocol to evaluate modifications of brain resting state functional connectivity. between-group differences were observed for the geriatric depression scale and hamilton depression rating scale, with higher scores for patients with lld. voxel-wise, 1-way analysis of variance revealed between-group differences in left frontoparietal network (lfpn) and sensory motor network (smn): increased intrinsic connectivity in the lld group was observed in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the left superior parietal lobule of the lfpn and increased intrinsic connectivity in the lld group was observed in the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex of the smn. our findings support the use of resting state fmri as a potential biomarker for lld; even if to confirm the relationship between brain changes and the pathophysiology of lld, longitudinal neuroimaging studies are required.
depression	the arthritis self-efficacy scale-8 (ases-8) is a valid tool to measure patients' arthritis-specific self-efficacy. however, evidence about reliability and validity of the ases-8 in chinese arthritis patients is lacking. this study aimed to culturally adapt and test the psychometric properties of the chinese version of the ases-8. chinese ases-8 was translated from original english version using translation and back-translation procedures. validation survey was then conducted in a university-affiliated hospital by a set of questionnaires comprised chinese ases-8, pain-vas, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), functional assessment of chronic illness therapy fatigue (facit-f), and short form 36-item health survey (sf-36) physical functioning subscale. a convenience sample of 134 patients with rheumatoid arthritis was recruited from the department of rheumatology. validity was assessed by pearson 's correlation analysis and exploratory factor analysis. reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (icc) and cronbach 's alpha. exploratory factor analysis extracted one dimension that explained of the 71.35% variation. significant negative correlations were found between the ases-8 and pain-vas, hads-d, hads-a scores (r -0.487 to -0.656, p < 0.01), while positive correlations were found between the ases-8 and sf-36 ph (r = 0.561, p < 0.01), facit-f (r = 0.660, p < 0.01). excellent test-retest reliability (icc = 0.98) and internal consistency (cronbach 's alpha = 0.942) were demonstrated. the chinese version of the ases-8 had statistically acceptable levels of reliability and validity for assessing self-efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. this disease-specific scale is particularly valuable for use among patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the chinese population.
social_cognition	objective: neurocognition is known to impact functioning in individuals at ultrahigh risk (uhr) for psychosis, but studies investigating potential mediators of this relationship are scarce. building on evidence from schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the study tested whether negative symptoms and social skills act as mediators between neurocognition and functional outcome in uhr individuals. methods: ultrahigh risk participants (n = 84) underwent neurocognitive testing using the brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia. social skills and negative symptoms were assessed using the high-risk social challenge task and the scale for the assessment of negative symptoms respectively. four instruments were used to assess overall functioning, and one instrument assessed quality of life encompassing social functioning. results: the cross-sectional analyses revealed that neurocognition was related to the measures of functioning. negative symptoms mediated the relationship between neurocognition and four of the five measures of functioning. we did not find social skills to mediate between neurocognition and functioning. conclusion: negative symptoms appear to mediate the relationship between neurocognition and functional outcome in uhr individuals, but the finding needs to be confirmed and extended to longitudinal studies. this underscores the importance of focusing on both neurocognition and negative symptoms when aiming at improving the functional outcome of uhr individuals.
social_cognition	for more than 40 years, the uncanny valley model has captivated researchers from various fields of expertise. still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. more recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. in order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (vr) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. using the same prerecorded 3d scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. as human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an ""uncanny valley of mind"" that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. a possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its ""threat to human distinctiveness"" concept is discussed.

social_cognition	using structural mri, we investigated the brain substrates of both affective and cognitive theory of mind (tom) in 19 patients with semantic dementia. we also ran intrinsic connectivity analyses to identify the networks to which the substrates belong and whether they are functionally disturbed in semantic dementia. in line with previous studies, we observed a tom impairment in patients with semantic dementia even when semantic memory was regressed out. our results also highlighted different neural bases according to the nature (affective or cognitive) of the representations being inferred. the affective tom deficit was associated with atrophy in the amygdala, suggesting the involvement of emotion-processing deficits in this impairment. by contrast, cognitive tom performances were correlated with the volume of medial prefrontal and parietal regions, as well as the right frontal operculum. intrinsic connectivity analyses revealed decreased functional connectivity, mainly between midline cortical regions and temporal regions. they also showed that left medial temporal regions were functionally isolated, a further possible hindrance to normal social cognitive functioning in semantic dementia. overall, this study addressed for the first time the neuroanatomical substrates of both cognitive and affective tom disruption in semantic dementia, highlighting disturbed connectivity within the networks that sustain these abilities.
social_cognition	objective: to investigate whether risperidone improves social cognitive impairments and executive dysfunction in people with schizophrenia. methods: fifty-six patients who met the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition, diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were allocated to a risperidone treatment group (rtg, n= 28) and a typical antipsychotic treatment group (tatg, n= 28). twenty-eight healthy volunteers were recruited as the normal control group (ncg). the positive and negative syndrome scale, interpersonal perception task-15 (ipt-15), and wisconsin card sorting test (wcst) were rated at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment with risperidone or typical antipsychotics. results: risperidone and typical antipsychotics decreased positive and negative syndrome scale scores for total psychopathology and positive and negative symptoms. at baseline, in the ipt-15, total scores and five factor scores, as well as the number of categories completed and the percentage of conceptual level responses, were significantly lower in the rtg and tatg than in the ncg, whereas total response errors, perseverative errors, and failure to maintain set were significantly higher in the patient groups than in the ncg. repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of time period (baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks) for ipt-15 scores and wcst performances, and significant interactions for time period x group (rtg and tatg). multivariate analysis of variance showed no significant differences between the rtg and tatg on ipt-15 scores at 4 weeks, but there were significant differences between these two groups at 12 weeks. significant differences were also found between the rtg and tatg on wcst performances at 4 and 12 weeks. conclusion: individuals with schizophrenia have impairments in social cognitive and executive function, which might be improved by risperidone.
social_cognition	this study aims to explore the potential impairment of theory of mind (tom; i.e., the ability to represent cognitive and affective mental states to both self and others) and the clinical, neuropsychological and quality of life (qol) correlates of these cognitive abnormalities in the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), a multisystem neurodegenerative disease recently recognized as a part of the same clinical and pathological spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. twenty-two consecutive, cognitively intact als patients, and 15 healthy controls, underwent assessment of executive, verbal comprehension, visuospatial, behavioral, and qol measures, as well as of the tom abilities by emotion attribution task (eat), advanced test of tom (att), and eyes task (et). als patients obtained significantly lower scores than controls on eat and et. no significant difference was found between the two groups on att. as regard to type of als onset, patients with bulbar onset performed worse than those with spinal onset on et. correlation analysis revealed that eat and et were positively correlated with education, memory prose, visuo-spatial performances, and ""mental health"" scores among qol items. our results suggest that not only ""cognitive"" but also ""affective"" subcomponents of tom may be impaired in the early stages of als, with significant linkage to disease onset and dysfunctions of less executively demanding conditions, causing potential impact on patients' ""mental health.
social_cognition	background: up to 60% of patients with bipolar disorder (bd) have a history of traumatic events, which is associated with greater episode severity, higher risk of comorbidity and higher relapse rates. trauma-focused treatment strategies for bd are thus necessary but studies are currently scarce. the aim of this study is to examine whether eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) therapy focusing on adherence, insight, de-idealisation of manic symptoms, prodromal symptoms and mood stabilization can reduce episode severity and relapse rates and increase cognitive performance and functioning in patients with bd. methods/ design: this is a single-blind, randomized controlled, multicentre trial in which 82 patients with bd and a history of traumatic events will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms: emdr therapy or supportive therapy. patients in both groups will receive 20 psychotherapeutic sessions, 60 min each, during 6 months. the primary outcome is a reduction of affective episodes after 12 and 24 months in favour of the emdr group. as secondary outcome we postulate a greater reduction in affective symptoms in the emdr group (as measured by the bipolar depression rating scale, the young mania rating scale and the clinical global impression scale modified for bd), and a better performance in cognitive state, social cognition and functioning (as measured by the screen for cognitive impairment in psychiatry, the mayer-saloveycaruso emotional intelligence test and the functioning assessment short test, respectively). traumatic events will be evaluated by the holmes-rahe life stress inventory, the clinician-administered ptsd scale and the impact of event scale. discussion: the results of this study will provide evidence whether a specific emdr protocol for patients with bd is effective in reducing affective episodes, affective symptoms and functional, cognitive and trauma
social_cognition	psychopathological symptoms and cognitive impairment are related to psychosocial functioning. however, the nature of the association of cognitive impairment with psychosocial functioning still remains under scrutiny. we aimed to examine the relationships of premorbid adjustment, lifetime psychopathological dimensions, and cognitive performance with the typical level of psychosocial functioning during the previous year. we assessed ninety patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and affective disorders with psychotic symptoms to collect data on premorbid adjustment, lifetime psychopathological dimensions, cognitive performance and psychosocial functioning. sixty-five healthy volunteers were included as controls. pearson 's correlations and hierarchical regression analyses were performed to ascertain to what extent the aforementioned variables predicted psychosocial functioning. functional domains were significantly correlated with most of the premorbid features, lifetime psychopathological dimensions and cognitive domains. however, lifetime negative symptoms were the best predictors of psychosocial functioning in the hierarchical regression analyses (explaining between 47 and 64% of the variance). for psychosocial outcome in patients with psychoses, lifetime negative symptoms showed a stronger predictive validity than cognitive impairment or premorbid adjustment.

social_cognition	alterations in general intellectual ability and social cognition in schizophrenia are core features of the disorder, evident at the illness' onset and persistent throughout its course. however, previous studies examining cognitive alterations in siblings discordant for schizophrenia yielded inconsistent results. present study aimed to investigate the nature of the association between facial emotion recognition and general iq by applying genetically sensitive cross-trait cross-sibling design. participants (total n=158; patients, unaffected siblings, controls) were assessed using the benton facial recognition test, the degraded facial affect recognition task (dfar) and the wechsler adult intelligence scale-iii. patients had lower iq and altered facial emotion recognition in comparison to other groups. healthy siblings and controls did not significantly differ in iq and dfar performance, but siblings exhibited intermediate angry facial expression recognition. cross-trait within-subject analyses showed significant associations between overall dfar performance and iq in all participants. within-trait cross-sibling analyses found significant associations between patients' and siblings' iq and overall dfar performance, suggesting their familial clustering. finally, cross-trait cross-sibling analyses revealed familial covariation of facial emotion recognition and iq in siblings discordant for schizophrenia, further indicating their familial etiology. both traits are important phenotypes for genetic studies and potential early clinical markers of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

social_cognition	the primate prefrontal cortex represents both past and future goals. to investigate its role in representing the goals of other agents, we designed a nonmatch-to-goal task that involved a human-monkey (h-m) interaction. during each trial, 2 of 4 potential goal objects were presented randomly to the left or right part of a display screen, and the monkey 's (or human 's) task was to choose the one that did not match the object goal previously chosen. human and monkey trials were intermixed, and each agent, when acting as observer, was required to monitor the other actor 's choice to switch the object goal choice in case it became the actor on the subsequent trial. we found neurons encoding the actor, either the monkey itself or the human, neurons encoding the agent future goal position and neurons encoding the agent previous goal position. in the category of neurons encoding the human future goal, we differentiated between those encoding the future goal of both agents and those encoding only the human agent future goal. while the first one might represent a covert mental simulation in the human trials, the other one could represent a prediction signal of the other 's agent choice.
social_cognition	we tested social cognition abilities of adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (asd) and neurotypically developed peers (ntd). a multi-faceted test-battery including facial emotion categorization (fec), classical false belief tasks (fbt), and complex social cognition (sc), yielded significantly lower accuracy rates for fec and complex sc tasks in asd, but no significant differences in performance concerning fbt. a significant correlation between age and performance in a fec task and in a complex task was found only in asd. we propose that dynamic and/or fragmented fec tasks can elicit deficits in implicit processing of facial emotion more efficiently. the difficulties of asd in solving complex sc tasks can be ascribed to deficits in the acquisition and application of social schemata.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: motor retardation is a cardinal feature in adult depression. limited information exists about motor activity in depressed children. the present study evaluated motor activity in depressed children compared to controls and investigated whether motor activity can be linked with the severity of symptoms in depressed children. method: motor activity during both day- and night time was recorded by actigraphy in twenty-two depressed children and their controls. a k-sads-pl interview of the child and his/her mother was used to diagnose depression. the depressed children filled in the child depression inventory (cdi) as a self-report of the severity of depression. parents and teachers of both depressed children and controls filled in the child behavior checklist (cbcl) and the teacher report form (trf). results: motor activity was reduced during the daytime in depressed children compared to controls ( p < 0.001). depressed children spent more time in total immobility during the night time than their peers (p < 0.05). in depressed children motor activity was linked with the severity of self- (r = 0.45, p < 0.05) and teacher-reported (r = -0.52, p<0.05) symptoms. depressed children with suicidal ideation (n = 10) differed significantly in motor activity compared to depressed children without suicidal ideation (n = 12) and controls (n = 22). limitations: sample size was only moderate. conclusions: reduced motor activity is an important feature of childhood depression. objectively measured motor activity can distinguish depressed children from their peers. motor retardation can be linked with the severity of depression, especially suicidal ideation and possibly subtype depressed children into groups with different etiology, treatment needs and course of illness.

seasonal_affective_disorder	both short wavelength (blue) light and caffeine have been studied for their mood enhancing effects on humans. the ability of blue light to increase alertness, mood and cognitive function via non-image forming neuropathways has been suggested as a non-pharmacological countermeasure for depression across a range of occupational settings. this experimental study compared blue light and caffeine and aimed to test the effects of blue light/placebo (blu), white light/240-mg caffeine (caf), blue light/240-mg caffeine (bcaf) and white light/placebo (pla), on mood. a randomised, controlled, crossover design study was used, in a convenience population of 20 healthy volunteers. the participants rated their mood on the swedish core affect scales (scas) prior to and after each experimental condition to assess the dimensions of valence and activation. there was a significant main effect of light (p = 0.009), and the combination of blue light and caffeine had clear positive effects on core effects (es, ranging from 0.41 to 1.20) and global mood (es, 0.61 +/- 0.53). the benefits of the combination of blue light and caffeine should be further investigated across a range of applications due to the observed effects on the dimensions of arousal, valence and pleasant activation.
seasonal_affective_disorder	clinical depression affects physicians, including radiologists. medical professionals, including radiologists, may be more comfortable treating a patient than being one, and psychiatric issues may be regarded as taboo for discussion, so the issue of clinical depression in the specialty and subspecialty has not received widespread attention. specifically, a review of the national and international literature in pubmed, scopus, and google reveals few publications dedicated to the issue of clinical depression in radiology; although statistically, they must exist. the purpose of this report is to define the terms and describe the manifestations and scope of the issues related to clinical depression, with special attention given to risk factors unique to radiologists, such as working in low ambient light or near different fields of magnetic strength. by the end of the article, it is the authors hope that the reading radiologist will be aware of, and open to, the possibility of clinical depression in a colleague or within his or herself because clinical depression is common and it is important to get help.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: cloninger 's psychobiological model of personality has been extensively applied to subjects affected by mood disorders (mood). however, most studies are widely heterogeneous in terms of sample size, methods of assessment, and selection of participants. methods: we conducted a systematic review of literature and a random effects meta-analysis of studies comparing at least two of the following groups: (a) adults with a primary mood diagnosis (bipolar disorder (bp) or major depressive disorder (mdd)), (b) their unaffected siblings (sib) or (c) healthy subjects (hs), and reporting quantitative results from the tridimensional personality questionnaire (tpq) or the temperament and character inventory (tci). subgroup, sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were also conducted. results: high harm avoidance and low self-directedness were consistently associated with mood and sib samples. bp was characterized by higher scores in novelty seeking and self-transcendence than hs, sib and mdd. age seemed to have a negative effect on novelty seeking and a positive effect on harm avoidance, cooperativeness and self-transcendence. an euthymic mood state was associated with reduced harm avoidance, but increased reward dependence, self-directedness and cooperativeness. limitations: the quality of the included studies varied and was relatively low. moreover, publication bias and heterogeneity in the distribution of effect sizes may also have limited our results. conclusion: high harm avoidance and low self-directedness may be trait markers for mood in general, while high novelty seeking and high self-transcendence may be specific to bp. future studies are needed to disentangle the state-trait effect of each personality dimension.

seasonal_affective_disorder	indoor tanning (it) has been linked with psychiatric and addictive symptoms, and frequent tanning may indicate tanning dependence (addiction). the current study evaluated the effects of an it episode on mood states and the association of these effects with psychiatric and addictive symptoms among young adult female indoor tanners. one-hundred thirty-nine female university students aged 18-25 years who had indoor tanned completed an online survey including the positive and negative affects scales and a standardized psychiatric interview (the mini international neuropsychiatric interview) via telephone. psychiatric and addictive symptoms were relatively common among these young adult female indoor tanners. overall, participants reported significant decreases in both negative (upset, scared, irritable, nervous, jittery, afraid) and positive (feeling interested) mood states after their most recent tanning episode. multivariable linear regression analyses showed that more frequent indoor tanning in the past month and symptoms of illicit drug use disorders were associated with decreases in negative mood, and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder were associated with a decrease in feeling interested. in summary, indoor tanners report relatively high rates of psychiatric and substance use symptoms, including symptoms of tanning dependence, and indoor tanning appears to alter mood. women with certain substance use and psychiatric characteristics may be more vulnerable to such mood changes after tanning indoors. further research is needed to clarify the relationships among these variables.
seasonal_affective_disorder	circadian rhythms are near 24-h cycles in a number of physiological and behavioural parameters and the underpinning circadian timing systems is one of the key homeostatic regulatory systems in mammalian physiology. many common psychiatric conditions are associated with disrupted sleep, including a common occurrence of delayed or advanced phase sleep syndromes, which in themselves may be indicative of dysregulated circadian timing in these disorders. in this article we discuss the evidence for abnormal circadian rhythms in seasonal affective disorder, bipolar disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. much of this evidence suggest that these conditions are associated with either phase delays or phase advances of core phase markers of the circadian clock such as melatonin or core body temperature, suggesting the presence of circadian desynchrony in these conditions. we also highlight findings that pharmacological and/or behavioural interventions that ameliorate circadian misalignments are efficacious in producing symptomatic relief, suggesting an intrinsic link between the circadian and affective systems that can be manipulated for clinical benefit.
seasonal_affective_disorder	chronotherapeutics such as wake therapy and bright light therapy are well-established methods in treating adults with depressive disorders and are additionally beneficent for sleep regulation. few studies concerning chronotherapeutics in juvenile depression exist, though the established treatments are insufficient and sleep disorders often co-occur. in this study, we investigate the impact of two types of chronotherapeutics on depressive symptoms and sleep behavior in a juvenile setting. juvenile inpatients (n = 62) with moderate to severe depressive symptoms took part in either a combined setting consisting of one night wake therapy followed by 2 weeks bright light therapy or in a setting of bright light therapy alone. depressive symptoms, general psychopathology, clinical impression and sleep behavior were measured before (t1), directly after (t2) and 2 weeks after intervention (t3). depressive symptoms decreased while sleep quality increased in both groups. the bright light therapy alone group showed further improvement at t3 in regards to depressive symptoms. correlation analyses indicated significant negative correlations between sleep quality and awaking after restorative sleep with the depressive symptoms. however, only awaking after restorative sleep had a predictive impact on treatment outcome. the present study provides first evidence for a positive impact of chronotherapeutic interventions on treatment outcome in depressed juvenile inpatients. bright light therapy seems to stabilize and further enhance reduction of depressive symptoms during follow-up, whereas one night wake therapy does not have an additional long-lasting impact on depressive symptoms and sleep parameters.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: bright-light intervention is reported to successfully treat depression, in particular seasonal affective disorder, but the neural pathways and molecular mechanisms mediating its effects are unclear. an amygdala-prefrontal cortex corticolimbic circuit regulates responses to salient environmental stimuli (e.g., threat) and may underlie these effects. serotonin signaling modulates this circuit and is implicated in the pathophysiology of seasonal and other affective disorders. methods: we evaluated the effects of a bright-light intervention protocol on threat-related corticolimbic reactivity and functional coupling, assessed with an emotional faces functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm at preintervention and postintervention. in a double-blind study conducted in the winter, 30 healthy male subjects received bright-light intervention (dose range between participants:.1-11.0 kilolux) for 30 minutes daily over a period of 3 weeks. additionally, we considered serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-httlpr) genotype status as a model for differences in serotonin signaling and moderator of intervention effects. results: bright-light dose significantly negatively affected threat-related amygdala and prefrontal reactivity in a dose-dependent manner. conversely, amygdala-prefrontal and intraprefrontal functional coupling increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. genotype status significantly moderated bright-light intervention effects on intraprefrontal functional coupling. conclusions: this is the first study to evaluate the effects of clinically relevant bright-light intervention on threat-related brain function. we show that amygdala-prefrontal reactivity and communication are significantly affected by bright-light intervention, an effect partly moderated by genotype. these novel findings support that this threat-related corticolimbic circuit is sensitive to light intervention and may mediate the therapeutic effects of bright-light intervention.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: depression is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that is often very severe and life threatening. in spite of the remarkable progress in understanding the neural biology, the etiopathophysiology of depression is still elusive. in this study, we have investigated molecular mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex of mice showing depression-like phenotype induced by chronic defeat stress. methods: depression-like phenotype was induced in c57bl/6 mice by subjecting them to a 10-day social defeat paradigm. the metabolic activity of excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid [gaba]ergic) neurons of the prefrontal cortex was measured by h-1-[c-13]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy together with infusion of [1,6-c-13(2)]glucose. in addition, the expression level of genes associated with glutamatergic and gabaergic pathways was monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. results: mice showing depression-like phenotype exhibit significant reduction in the levels of glutamate, glutamine, n-acetyl aspartate, and taurine in the prefrontal cortex. most importantly, findings of reduced c-13 labeling of glutamate-c4, glutamate-c3, and gaba-c2 from [1,6-c-13(2)] glucose indicate decreased glutamatergic and gabaergic neuronal metabolism and neurotransmitter cycling in the depressed mice. the reduced glutamine-c4 labeling suggests decreased neurotransmitter cycling in depression. quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed reduced transcripts of gad1 and eaat2 genes, which code for enzymes involved in the synthesis of gaba and the clearance of glutamate from synapses, respectively. conclusions: these data indicate that the activities of glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons are reduced in mice showing a depression-like phenotype, which is supported by molecular data for the expression of genes involved in glutamate and gaba pathways.
seasonal_affective_disorder	this study investigates another calendar anomaly the literature does not yet address - the week-of-the-year (woy) effect. using the weekly returns on the stock market indexes of 20 countries worldwide, for a period that ends in december 2010, the findings demonstrate that returns in week 44, which starts on october 29 and ends on november 4, are positive in 19 of the 20 countries, and in 18 of them, it is also statistically significant. in contrast, the returns for week 43, which starts on october 22 and ends on october 28, are negative in 19 of the 20 countries, and statistically significant for most of the countries. we also apply an investment strategy derived from these findings to a prediction period (2009-2010), and find that this strategy beats the simple buy-and-hold policy by a substantial margin.

person_perception	categorization plays a fundamental role in organizing daily interactions with the social world. however, there is increasing recognition that social categorization is often complex, both because category membership can be ambiguous (e.g., multiracial or transgender identities) and because different categorical identities (e.g., race and gender) may interact to determine the meaning of category membership. these complex identities simultaneously impact social perceivers' impressions and social targets' own experiences of identity, thereby shaping perceptions, experiences, and interactions in fundamental ways. this review examines recent research on the perception and experience of the complex, multifaceted identities that both complicate and enrich our lives. although research has historically tended to focus more on difficulties and challenges associated with multiple identities, increasing attention is being paid to opportunities that emerge from the possession of identities that include multiple distinct or overlapping groups. we consider how these opportunities might benefit both perceivers and targets.
person_perception	in web 2.0 environment, the influence of customers' voices is increasing. many companies have built their online brand communities for listening to the diverse voices of the customer (voc) and promoting customer 's engagement. the information obtained from these brand communities is exploited for organizational innovation. however, the voc with negative contents could possibly present threats to a firm in an online context. in this study, we develop a research model that includes the types of customer expectations, opinion leader engagement, negative valence of voc, interaction, and innovation. subsequently, we empirically validate the effects of customer expectations on the interactions among community members and organizational innovation by using a dataset from mystarbucksidea.com. the results show that the effects of voc on the interaction within a brand community and organizational innovation are different depending on the types of expectation in the voc. opinion leaders' engagement positively affects the interaction among community members. moreover, the negative valence of voc affects the relationships between customer expectations and interactions, and results in a possible threat within an online brand community. the research results give some insight into managing the brand community and analyzing the vocs so as to achieve organizational innovation.

person_perception	this study extends the research of the third-person effect by examining the effect of time span of media message on perceptual and behavioral components of the third-person effect. using a survey of hong kong residents, the study explores perceived media effect of the news coverage of a short- and a long-term issue and the predictor of intention to take action to reduce negative effect. the results revealed no third-person effect by the short-term messages and the reverse third-person effect (first-person effect) by the long-term messages. there was a significant difference in discrepancy between the perceived media effect on self and others (third-person perception) produced by the messages of the short- and long-term issue. the study also found that perceived media effect on self is a stronger predictor of intention to take action to reduce the negative effects of the short- and long-term issue than the third-person effect.
person_perception	while smiling enhances women 's facial attractiveness, the findings are inconclusive for men. the present study investigated the effect of smiling on male facial attractiveness for short- and long-term prospective partners using east asian and european samples. in experiment 1 (n = 218), where female participants rated male facial attractiveness, the facilitative effect of smiling was present when judging long-term partners but absent for short- term partners. this pattern was observed for east asians as well as for europeans. experiment 2 (n = 71) demonstrated that smiling male faces engendered an impression suitable for long-term partnership (e.g., high ratings of trustworthiness) while neutral faces produced an impression suitable for short- term partnership (e.g., high ratings of masculinity). we discuss these results in terms of opposing evolutionary strategies in mate choice: heritable benefit versus paternal investment.
person_perception	the present study used eyetracking methodology to assess whether individuals high in external motivation ( em) to appear nonprejudiced exhibit an early bias in visual attention toward black faces indicative of social threat perception. drawing on previous work examining visual attention to socially threatening stimuli, the authors predicted that high-em participants, but not lower-em participants, would initially look toward black faces and then subsequently direct their attention away from these faces. participants viewed pairs of images, some of which consisted of one white and one black male face, while a desk-mounted eyetracking camera recorded their eye movements. results showed that, as predicted, high-em, but not lower-em, individuals exhibited patterns of visual attention indicative of social threat perception.
person_perception	the facial first impressions literature has focused on trait dimensions, with less research on how social categories (like gender) may influence first impressions of faces. yet, social psychological studies have shown the importance of categories like gender in the evaluation of behaviour. we investigated whether face gender affects the positive or negative evaluation of faces in terms of first impressions. in , we manipulated facial gender stereotypicality, and in , facial trustworthiness or dominance, and examined the valence of resulting spontaneous descriptions of male and female faces. for both male and female participants, counter-stereotypical (masculine or dominant looking), female faces were perceived more negatively than facially stereotypical male or female faces. in , we examined how facial dominance and trustworthiness affected rated valence across 1,000 male and female ambient face images, and replicated the finding that dominance is more negatively evaluated for female faces. in , the same effect was found with short stimulus presentations. these findings integrate the facial first impressions literature with evaluative differences based on social categories.
person_perception	social-categorical knowledge is partially grounded in proprioception. in study 1, participants describing ""hard"" and ""soft"" politicians, and ""hard"" and ""soft"" scientists used different ""hard"" and ""soft"" traits for the two groups, suggesting that the meaning of these traits is context specific. studies 2 to 4 showed that both meanings were supported by hard and soft proprioception. consistent with political stereotypes, perceivers viewing faces while handling a hard ball were more likely to categorize them as republicans rather than as democrats, compared to perceivers viewing the same faces while handling a soft ball (study 2). similarly, consistent with stereotypes of ""hard"" and ""soft"" academic disciplines, perceivers were more likely to categorize photographs of professors as physicists than historians when handling a hard versus soft ball (study 3). finally, thinking about republicans and democrats led participants to perceive a ball as harder or softer, respectively, suggesting that simulating proprioception might aid social-categorical thinking (study 4).
person_perception	despite advances in women 's equality, and perhaps as a result of it, sexist humor is prevalent in society. research on this topic has lacked realism in the way the humor is conveyed to participants, and has not examined perceptions of both men and women who use sexist humor. we embedded jokes in printed facebook profiles to present sexist humor to participants. we manipulated the gender of the individual in the profile (man or woman), and the type of joke presented (anti-men, anti-women, neutral) in a 2 x 3 between-groups design. we found that both men and women rated anti-women jokes as more sexist than neutral humor, and women also rated anti-men jokes as sexist. we also found that men who displayed anti-women humor were perceived less positively than men displaying anti-men humor, or women displaying either type of humor. these findings suggest that there may be different gender norms in place for joke tellers regarding who is an acceptable target of sexist humor.
person_perception	using online comments posted on news stories as the context, this study aimed to examine the interplay between the third-person perception (tpp) - that people believe media message have a greater effect on changing the attitudes of others compared with themselves - and online incivility. it also examined whether people 's agreement with the content of the comments would influence the tpp. results of an experiment (n = 301) showed incivility muted the persuasive effect of online comments, so only civil comments produced a tpp, whereby people felt comments had greater persuasive power over others compared with themselves. however, counter to predictions, whether people agreed with the comments did not influence the tpp. findings also supported the tpp social distance corollary such that subjects perceived comments as having the largest third-person perceptual gap between the self and those who disagreed with them. results are discussed in relation to tpp and face and politeness theories.

person_perception	three experiments examined whether people spontaneously generate evaluations of target individuals under circumstances in which they are also known to generate spontaneous trait inferences (stis). the first experiment used a standard savings-in-relearning paradigm to explore whether exposure to trait-implicative behavior descriptions facilitates the learning of evaluatively-congruent, as well as behaviorimplied, personality traits. evidence for the facilitated learning of evaluatively-congruent traits was not obtained. this led to a second experiment in which the savings-in-relearning paradigm was altered to directly assess participants' relearning of evaluative words (good/bad). the results demonstrated that the same trait-implicative behavioral stimuli can produce both spontaneous trait inferences and spontaneous evaluations when both are measured correctly. both of these outcomes were replicated in a third study using a false recognition paradigm. the implications of these findings for impression formation processes and for the possible independence of semantic information and evaluative information are discussed.
media_violence	the existing research on the appeal of media violence has led to an apparent incongruity: violent content tends to increase selective exposure to media, but violence often decreases enjoyment. in this experiment, we used two independent manipulations to assess the role of violence in both selective exposure and enjoyment in order to examine the relationship between the two. program descriptions for four prime-time television dramas were altered to create violent and nonviolent descriptions for each episode. then the episodes themselves were edited to create violent and nonviolent versions of each. participants (n = 191) were more likely to choose violent descriptions to watch, but enjoyed the nonviolent episodes more than the violent episodes. moreover, the nonviolent episodes were rated as more enjoyable even when the participants had chosen to watch a violent program description. from a theoretical perspective, these results suggest the need to move beyond explaining the appeal of violence in terms of increased enjoyment and instead further explore other motivations that could be driving selective exposure to violent content. aggr. behav. 38: 175-184, 2012.

media_violence	this essay explains how the collection of papers in this volume contributes to the growing scholarly literature dealing with hockey 's role in canadian society and culture. in particular, this project explores aspects of hockey - and its connection to the sports media - which have not been sufficiently examined by historians. the cultural history of hockey in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has not been researched thoroughly by those working in the fields of sport history, canadian history or cultural studies. this study addresses this deficiency by assessing key elements of the media-constructed world of hockey' during the early years of stanley cup competition. it examines local and national newspaper coverage of championship hockey games between 1894 and 1907 in order to understand interurban and regional rivalries, the national scope of the sports media, violence and gender construction and community representation. as local and national audiences were exposed to similar media texts and narratives about hockey, they developed shared understandings of the cultural meanings of the sport throughout canada.
media_violence	violent video games have been a source of controversy in the united states and elsewhere for several decades. considerable concern has been raised in the public and scientific communities about the alleged deleterious effects of violent games. these concerns may coincide with periodic moral panics about media 's influence, particularly on youth. this paper argues that the negative effects of violent games have been exaggerated by some elements of the scientific community, fitting with past cycles of media-focused moral panics. by contrast, potential positive effects of violent video game play have been ignored in the debate on violent games. the current paper considers research in several areas, including aggression, but also the nascent research fields of visuospatial cognition, social networking, and use as educational tools. it is argued that the debate on video game violence should be broadened to include both potential negative and positive effects.
media_violence	this article analyzes the association between civil conflicts and educational achievement by studying the turkish case. it combines the 2005 university entrance exam scores of more than 1.6 million students and a newly constructed data set on the casualties of the turkish-kurdish conflict to study the association between the conflict and educational achievement of turkish students. the results reveal a significant negative association. combined with the already well-established positive links between education and various measures of socioeconomic development like economic growth, social equality, and public health, the results in this article demonstrate that education is one of the channels through which civil conflicts damage the well-being of societies thereby creating the conditions that perpetuate them.
media_violence	the discussion about violent video games tends to engender extreme positions, each of which are deserving of deep skepticism. ferguson 's (2015, this issue) claim that humans can do something repeatedly with no effect on them should be examined carefully, especially as it violates most established psychological and learning theories. in this commentary, we examine three aspects of ferguson 's claim. first, it is a typical rhetorical trick to sow doubt, but it is valuable to examine the doubting claims. second, it is good rhetoric to direct attention in only one direction, but it is valuable to examine that direction within its broader outlook. third, it is good rhetoric to imply bias on the part of one position, but it is valuable to examine the potential biases on all sides. good science definitely requires skeptics. the problem with the violent video game debate is perhaps that we have not been skeptical enough.
media_violence	we compared the standard 2d representation of a recent violent computer game to its 3d representation realized by shutter-goggles in a lab experiment. assuming that the higher degree of realism of media violence would impact stronger on players in a pretest-posttest design, we analyzed the influence of violent video game exposure on implicit and explicit measures of aggressiveness. according to an explicit questionnaire on aggressiveness, participants reported having becoming more peaceful, whereas an implicit association test on aggressiveness (agg-iat) indicated that the association between self and aggressive behavior became stronger after violence exposure, confirming the unique utility of agg-iats in media research. the 3d visualization mode, however, did not further strengthen this association, and a mediation model of increases in aggressiveness by participants' flow experiences was not supported. when inspecting flow experiences, an interaction effect between gender and visualization mode was evident: male participants were more likely to have flow experiences in the high-realism (3d) format, whereas female participants were more likely to experience flow in the standard (2d) mode. we discuss the findings in the context of automatic information processing in aggression, and we contend possible changes in automatic behavioral precursors due to media influence.

media_violence	it is an established fact that almost every tv channel offers a high level of violent content. the object of this study is to check the degree of acceptance of this media violence in under-18s. we will also check what cognitive and emotional effects the viewing of different types of violence has. a sample of 203 subjects aged 13 years from madrid, spain, viewed a clip from different films. before and after the film, data were collected about their opinion on violence. three viewing conditions were established according to the degree and type of violence shown and based on berkowitz [(1996): desclee de brouwer]: action without violence, socially justified violence, and socially unjustified violence. several anovas were carried out revealing that violence is better valued and more attractive after watching the film sequences than before the showing.

media_violence	disruptive behavior disorders (dbd) are among the most commonly diagnosed mental disorders in children and adolescents. some important characteristics of dbd vary based on the presence or absence of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd), which may affect the understanding of and treatment decision-making related to the disorders. thus, identifying neurobiological characteristics of dbd with comorbid adhd (dbd + adhd) can provide a basis to establish a better understanding of the condition. this study aimed to assess abnormal white matter microstructural alterations in dbd + adhd as compared to dbd alone and healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging (dti). thirty-three dbd (19 with comorbid adhd) and 46 age-matched healthy adolescents were studied using dti. fractional anisotropy (fa), and mean diffusivity (md), radial diffusivity (rd) and axial diffusivity (ad) were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (tbss). significantly lower fa and higher md. rd and ad in many white matter fibers were found in adolescents with dbd + adhd compared to controls. moreover, lower fa and higher rd were also found in the dbd + adhd versus the dbd alone group. alterations of white matter integrity found in dbd patients were primarily associated with adhd, suggesting that adhd comorbidity in dbd is reflected in greater abnormality of microstructural connections.

media_violence	the coming of we-media era has changed the way of the traditional media information dissemination. the decreased limitation of its terrain and time make it easier for the media violence to come into being and spread. the paper explores its spreading characteristics, strong and weak points and its future development tendency; in the end, it proposes the related measures of protection and strategies to deal with.
media_violence	qualitatively analyzing 35 responses from a letter-writing homework in a media literacy education program, this study examines sixth graders' understandings of producers' responsibility in creating media content. responses suggest their understandings about producers' responsibility are bounded within the context of their media use as consumers, rather than as citizens. findings focus on the importance of introducing contextual factors of media production as well as the challenges that researchers and educators might face.
schizophrenia	background: yoga and physical exercise have been used as adjunctive intervention for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (sz), but controlled comparisons are lacking. aims: a single-blind randomised controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether yoga training or physical exercise training enhance cognitive functions in sz, based on a prior pilot study. methods: consenting, clinically stable, adult outpatients with sz (n=286) completed baseline assessments and were randomised to treatment as usual (tau), supervised yoga training with tau (yt) or supervised physical exercise training with tau (pe). based on the pilot study, the primary outcome measure was speed index for the cognitive domain of attention' in the penn computerised neurocognitive battery. using mixed models and contrasts, cognitive functions at baseline, 21 days (end of training), 3 and 6 months post-training were evaluated with intention-to-treat paradigm. results: speed index of attention domain in the yt group showed greater improvement than pe at 6 months follow-up (p<0.036, effect size 0.51). in the pe group, accuracy index of attention domain showed greater improvement than tau alone at 6-month follow-up (p<0.025, effect size 0.61). for several other cognitive domains, significant improvements were observed with yt or pe compared with tau alone (p<0.05, effect sizes 0.30-1.97). conclusions: both yt and pe improved attention and additional cognitive domains well past the training period, supporting our prior reported beneficial effect of yt on speed index of attention domain. as adjuncts, yt or pe can benefit individuals with sz.
schizophrenia	increasing evidence suggests that altered immune functions are related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. relatively little information is available on toll-like receptors (tlrs), which are implicated in the recognition of molecular patterns associated with pathogens and internal cellular damage signals. by using immunophenotyping and flow cytometry, we investigated tlrs in cd14+ monocytes, cd4+cd25 +foxp3+ regulatory t cells (t-reg), and cd3+cd4+cd25+ activated t cells (t-act) in 35 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia before and after an 8-week period of antipsychotic treatment with risperidone or olanzapine. as compared with 30 healthy control individuals, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia exhibited an increased percentage of tlr4+ and tlr5+ monocytes and tlr5+ t-reg/t-act cells. at the end of the treatment period, we observed normalized tlr4+ monocytes and an up-regulation of tlr2+ monocytes and t-reg/t-act cells. mean fluorescent intensity values, indicating receptor density, were consistent with these findings. in the drug-naive state, but not after treatment, higher percentages of tlr4+ and tlr5+ monocytes were correlated with more severe cognitive deficits. positive, negative, and general clinical symptoms were not associated with tlrs. there were no significant differences between patients receiving olanzapine and risperidone. these results indicate that abnormal expression of tlr5 can be detected in the earliest stage of schizophrenia, which is modulated by antipsychotics. immunological alterations in unmedicated schizophrenia patients may be linked to cognitive deficits.

schizophrenia	this work describes restricted access material (ram) constituted of porous octadecylsilane particles with the outer surface covered with bovine serum albumin (c18-bsa) as a stationary phase to extract drugs from plasma samples by disposable pipette extraction (dpx) for further analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms). the c18-bsa phase simultaneously excluded macromolecules by chemical diffusion barrier (bsa network) and enrichment of the interior phase (c18) with drug traces by sorption. the hydrophilic barrier of the cl 8-bsa allows small molecules (drugs) to permeate through the hydrophobic part (c18), while at the same time it excludes the macromolecules by chemical diffusion barrier (bsa network). optimization of the dpx variables (sorption equilibration time, exclusion of endogenous compounds, and elution step) improved the sensitivity and selectivity of the method, which presented a linear range from the lower limit of quantification (0.5-20.0 ng ml(-1)) to the upper limit of quantification (32.5-10,500 ng ml(-1)), inter- and intra-assay precision with coefficients of variation (cv) lower than 15%, and relative standard error (rse) of the accuracy ranging from -12% to 11%. the developed method was successfully used to determine five antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine) in combination with seven antidepressants (mirtazapine, paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine, and fluoxetine), two anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and lamotrigine), and two anxiolytics (diazepam and clonazepam) in plasma samples from schizophrenic patients for therapeutic drug monitoring.

schizophrenia	the aim of the study is to describe the need profile of outpatients with schizophrenia belonging to an aymara ethnic group in latin-america and to compare that profile to non-aymara patients. a sample of 253 patients were evaluated with the two-way communication checklist (2-com checklist) measuring the needs and satisfaction of the patient; positive and negative syndrome scale for schizophrenia (panss) and attitude to the drugs (dai-10). no significant differences were found between aymara and non-aymara, either in the total number of needs or in the subscales of satisfaction or in the types of needs. after adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical factors, patients with higher severity (panss) had higher number of needs and lower level of satisfaction. higher score on dai-10 is related to a higher total number of needs and better satisfaction with medication. age, sex, ethnicity and employment were also associated with specific needs. the profile of the needs of schizophrenic aymara patients does not differ from that of non-aymara patients, and that in both groups it is necessary that the treatment primarily address symptom management and the subjective aspects of quality of life.
schizophrenia	background: people admitted to psychiatric hospitals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia may display behavioural problems. these may require management approaches such as use of coercive practices, which impact the wellbeing of staff members, visiting families and friends, peers, as well as patients themselves. studies have proposed that not only patients' conditions, but also treatment environment and ward culture may affect patients' behaviour. seclusion and restraint could possibly be prevented with staff education about user-centred, more humane approaches. staff education could also increase collaboration between patients, family members and staff, which may further positively affect treatment culture and lower the need for using coercive treatment methods. methods: this is a single-blind, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial involving 28 psychiatric hospital wards across finland. units will be randomised to receive either a staff educational programme delivered by the team of researchers, or standard care. the primary outcome is the incidence of use of patient seclusion rooms, assessed from the local/national health registers. secondary outcomes include use of other coercive methods (limb restraint, forced injection, and physical restraint), service use, treatment satisfaction, general functioning among patients, and team climate and employee turn-over (nursing staff). discussion: the study, designed in close collaboration with staff members, patients and their relatives, will provide evidence for a co-operative and user-centred educational intervention aiming to decrease the prevalence of coercive methods and service use in the units, increase the functional status of patients and improve team climate in the units. we have identified no similar trials.
schizophrenia	insomnia is a common feature in schizophrenia, and is characterized by an increase of sleep latency (sl), as well as reductions in total sleep time (tst) and sleep efficiency (se). regarding sleep architecture, non rapid -eye-movement (nrem) sleep, slow wave sleep (sws) and rapid-eye-movement (rem) sleep latency are decreased, whereas rem sleep tends to remain unchanged. according to polysomnographic studies, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone administration increased tst and/or se in healthy subjects. additionally, olanzapine and ziprasidone augmented sws, while changes corresponding to rem sleep were inconsistent. furthermore, administration of clozapine, olanzapine and paliperidone to patients with schizophrenia was followed in most instances by a significant reduction of sl and an increase of tst and se. in addition, olanzapine and paliperidone augmented sws and rem sleep. by contrast, quetiapine administration further disrupted sleep as judged by the increase of sl, wake time after sleep onset (waso) and rem sleep latency, and the reduction of sws and rem sleep. no consistent effects on sleep variables were obtained during treatment with risperidone. to date, no polysomnographic studies have been published on the effects of aripiprazole, asenapine, iloperidone and lurasidone on sleep in either healthy subjects or patients with schizophrenia. taken together, this evidence supports the conclusion that second generation antipsychotics (sgas) including clozapine, olanzapine and paliperidone may ameliorate insomnia in patients with schizophrenia.

schizophrenia	background: major depressive disorder (mdd) has a high personal and socio-economic burden and >60% of patients fail to achieve remission with the first antidepressant. the biological mechanisms behind antidepressant response are only partially known but genetic factors play a relevant role. a combined predictor across genetic variants may be useful to investigate this complex trait. methods: polygenic risk scores (prs) were used to estimate multi-allelic contribution to: 1) antidepressant efficacy; 2) its overlap with mdd and schizophrenia. we constructed prs and tested whether these predicted symptom improvement or remission from the gendep study (n = 736) to the star*d study (n = 1409) and vice-versa, including the whole sample or only patients treated with escitalopram or citalopram. using summary statistics from psychiatric genomics consortium for mdd and schizophrenia, we tested whether prs from these disorders predicted symptom improvement in gendep, star*d, and five further studies (n = 3756). results: no significant prediction of antidepressant efficacy was obtained from prs in gendep/star*d but this analysis might have been underpowered. there was no evidence of overlap in the genetics of antidepressant response with either mdd or schizophrenia, either in individual studies or a meta-analysis. stratifying by antidepressant did not alter the results. discussion: we identified no significant predictive effect using prs between pharmacogenetic studies. the genetic liability to mod or schizophrenia did not predict response to antidepressants, suggesting differences between the genetic component of depression and treatment response. larger or more homogeneous studies will be necessary to obtain a polygenic predictor of antidepressant response.(c) 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
schizophrenia	impaired insight into illness (imp-ins) is common among individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (ssd), contributing to medication nonadherence and poor clinical outcomes. caloric vestibular simulation (cvs) is typically used to assess peripheral vestibular system function. left cold cvs is also a transiently effective treatment for imp-ins and hemineglect secondary to right brain hemisphere stroke, and possibly for imp-ins and mood stabilization in patients with ssd. participants with ssd and moderate-to-severe imp-ins participated in an exploratory double blind, crossover, randomized controlled study of the effects of cvs on imp-ins. participants sequentially received all experimental conditions left cold (4 degrees c), right cold, and body temperature/sham cvs-in a random order. repeated measures anova were performed to compare changes in imp-ins, mood and positive symptom severity pre and 30 min post cvs. a significant interaction was found between cvs condition, time, and body temperature nystagmus peak slow phase velocity (pspv) for imp-ins, indicating that single session left cold cvs transiently improved imp-ins while right cold cvs may have worsened imp-ins, particularly in participants with greater vestibular reactivity (i.e. higher pspv) to body temperature cvs. the procedure 's effectiveness is attributed to stimulation of underactive right hemisphere circuits via vestibular nuclei projections to the contralateral hemisphere.
schizophrenia	the experience of childhood trauma (ct) and stressful life events (sles) is associated with subsequent development of a variety of mental health conditions, including psychotic illness. recent research identifying adolescents and young adults at clinical high risk (chr) for psychosis allows for prospective evaluation of the impact of trauma and adverse life events on psychosis onset and other outcomes, addressing etiological questions that cannot be answered in studies of fully psychotic or non-clinical populations. this article provides a comprehensive review of the current emerging literature on trauma and adverse life events in the chr population. up to 80% of chr youth endorse a lifetime history of childhood traumatic events and victimization (e.g., bullying). several studies have shown that the experience of ct predicts psychosis onset among chr individuals, while the literature on the influence of recent sles (e.g., death of a loved one) remains inconclusive. multiple models have been proposed to explain the link between trauma and psychosis, including the stress-vulnerability and stress-sensitivity hypotheses, with emphases on both cognitive processes and neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis). despite the preponderance of chr individuals who endorse either ct or sles, no clinical trials have been conducted evaluating interventions for trauma in chr youth to date. furthermore, the current process of formal identification and assessment of trauma, sles, and their impact on chr youth is inconsistent in research and clinical practice. recommendations for improving trauma assessment, treatment, and future research directions in the chr field are provided.
schizophrenia	the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2ds) is a microdeletion syndrome with high phenotypic variability, including somatic disorders like congenital heart disease and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. clinical observations suggest that many patients with 22q11.2ds suffer from severe fatigue. however, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the potential association between 22q11.2ds and fatigue. twenty-nine patients (mean age 26.8, 18-38 y) with 22q11.2ds completed the multidimensional fatigue inventory (mfi) measuring severity of fatigue. the results of the study group were compared with published population norms. in addition, cross-sectional associations between fatigue, depression (beck depression inventory-bdi), and a quality of life questionnaire (who) in patients with 22q11.2 ds were examined. subscales and total mfi scores were significantly higher in adults with 22q11.2ds. approximately 80% of the study group had a total mfi score above the mean of the norms. a significant correlation between depressive symptoms and fatigue was found. fatigue was also significantly associated with quality of life scores, specifically the general score, psychological health, and environment. this is the first report of high levels of fatigue in adults with the 22q11.2ds. fatigue is a frequent complaint in this age group and should get the necessary attention given its association with quality of life and depression severity. taking into account the multisystem nature of the 22q11.2ds, we recommend a systematic clinical examination to exclude underlying somatic or psychiatric causes of fatigue.
