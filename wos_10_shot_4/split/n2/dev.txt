alzheimer's_disease	we report a 22-year onset age man diagnosed with rapidly progressing early-onset alzheimer 's disease with predominant extrapyramidal symptoms as the initial presenting symptoms and v391g mutation in presenilin 1 gene (psen1) was founded. the unaffected parents of the proband are not carriers of the mutation but have histories of extrapyramidal diseases, suggesting de novo origin of v391g mutation. the val391gly variation widens the number of psen1 mutations responsible for early-onset alzheimer 's disease with extrapyramidal phenotype and would help to establish a functional map of presenilin 1 protein architecture.

alzheimer's_disease	aluminum is one of the most toxic metals causing a variety of neurologic diseases, especially alzheimer 's disease. it is impossible to avoid contact with aluminum because of its existence in food to medications. therefore, removal of aluminum from the blood or wastewater is urgently important. the cost-effective and easy-to-prepare adsorbents are needed to get efficient aluminum removal. for that purpose, the poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate-co-acrylic acid), poly(hema-co-aa), microparticles was synthesized to remove aluminum in a very short interaction time. the achievement of the desired polymeric structure was confirmed via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), scanning electron microscope (sem) and transmission electron microscope (tem), etc. additionally, particle features such as swelling ratio, size, and surface area were determined. the microparticles synthesized in this study have been determined with very good adsorption capacity even in small aluminum concentrations.
alzheimer's_disease	introduction: we examined the association between decreased cerebral blood flow (cbf) and cognitive impairment in alzheimer 's disease (ad), mild cognitive impairment (mci), and subjective cognitive decline (scd). methods: we included 161 ad, 95 mci, and 143 scd patients from the amsterdam dementia cohort. we used 3-t pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling to estimate whole-brain and regional partial volume-corrected cbf. neuropsychological tests covered global cognition and five cognitive domains. associations were investigated using linear regression analyses. results: in the whole sample, reduced overall and regional cbf was associated with impairment in all cognitive domains. we found significant interactions between diagnosis and cbf for language and between diagnosis and parietal cbf for global cognition and executive functioning. stratification showed that decreased cbf was associated with worse performance in ad patients but not in mci or scd. discussion: our results suggest that cbf may have potential as a functional marker of disease severity.

alzheimer's_disease	background: mobility changes are concerning for elderly patients with cognitive decline. given frail older individuals' vulnerability to injury, it is critical to identify contributors to limited mobility. objective: to examine whether structural brain abnormalities, including reduced gray matter volume and white matter hyperintensities, would be associated with limited mobility among individuals with cognitive impairment, and to determine whether cognitive impairment would mediate this relationship. methods: thirty-four elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (mci) and alzheimer 's disease underwent neuropsychological evaluation, mobility assessment, and structural brain neuroimaging. linear regression was conducted with predictors including gray matter volume in six regions of interest (roi) and white matter hyperintensity (wmh) burden, with mobility measures as outcomes. results: lower gray matter volume in caudate nucleus was associated with slower speed on a functional mobility task. higher cerebellar volume was also associated with slower functional mobility. white matter hyperintensity burden was not significantly associated with mobility. conclusion: our findings provide evidence for associations between subcortical gray matter volume and speed on a functional mobility task among cognitively impaired individuals.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease ( ad) is the most common cause of dementia and currently there are no effective disease-modifying treatments available. hallmark symptoms of ad include impaired hippocampus-dependent episodic memory and disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms. the pathways connecting these symptoms are of particular interest because it is well established that sleep and circadian disruption can impair hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. in rodents, these procedures also markedly suppress adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of brain plasticity that is believed to play an important role in pattern separation, and thus episodic memory. a causal role for sleep disruptions in ad pathophysiology is suggested by evidence for sleep-dependent glymphatic clearance of metabolic waste products from the brain. this review explores a complementary hypothesis that sleep and circadian disruptions in ad contribute to cognitive decline by activating neuroendocrine and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways that suppress hippocampal neurogenesis. evidence for this hypothesis underscores the promise of sleep, circadian rhythms, and neurogenesis as therapeutic targets for remediation of memory impairment in ad.

alzheimer's_disease	people with down 's syndrome (ds) are at high risk for developing alzheimer 's disease (ad) at a relatively young age. this increased risk is not observed in people with intellectual disabilities for reasons other than ds and for this reason it is unlikely to be due to non-specific effects of having a neurodevelopmental disorder but, instead, a direct consequence of the genetics of ds (trisomy 21). given the location of the amyloid precursor protein (app) gene on chromosome 21, the amyloid cascade hypothesis is the dominant theory accounting for this risk, with other genetic and environmental factors modifying the age of onset and the course of the disease. several potential therapies targeting the amyloid pathway and aiming to modify the course of ad are currently being investigated, which may also be useful for treating ad in ds. however, given that the neuropathology associated with ad starts many years before dementia manifests, any preventative treatment must start well before the onset of symptoms. to enable trials of such interventions, plasma, csf, brain, and retinal biomarkers are being studied as proxy early diagnostic and outcome measures for ad. in this systematic review, we consider the prospects for the development of potential preventative treatments of ad in the ds population and their evaluation.
alzheimer's_disease	hla-a is a locus of the major histocompatibility complex situated on chromosome 6p21.3. hla-a has been shown to be associated with susceptibility to alzheimer 's disease (ad). in this study, we firstly investigated the association of gene variants in hla-a and brain structures on mri in a large sample from the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative (adni) to explore the effects of hla-a on ad pathogenesis. we selected the hippocampus, parahippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, middle temporal, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala as regions of interest (rois). in hybrid population analysis, our results showed a marginally significant association between rs9260168 and the atrophy of the left parahippocampus (p = 0.007, pc = 0.054), rs3823342 and the atrophy of the left parahippocampus (p = 0.014, pc = 0.054), rs76475517, which only exists in caucasians with hla-a23 or hla-a24 alleles, and the atrophy of the right amygdala (p = 0.010, pc = 0.085) at baseline. in particular, the haplotype (tgacaagg), as a surrogate marker of hla-a2, was founded to be positively associated with the atrophy of the right hippocampus (p = 0.047) at baseline. furthermore, we detected the above four associations in mild cognitive impairment (mci) subpopulation analysis. our study provided preliminary evidences supporting hla-a2 in caucasians contribute to the risk of ad by modulating the alteration of hippocampal volume and hla-a gene variants appear to play a role in altering ad-related brain structures on mri.
alzheimer's_disease	objective and design alzheimer 's disease (ad) is associated with amyloid plaques (a beta) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein tangles in the brain. we investigated the possible neuroprotective role of flavocoxid, a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenases-1/2 (cox-1/2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-lox), in triple-transgenic (3xtg-ad) mice. subjects mice were 3 months at the beginning of the study. treatment animals received once daily for 3-month saline solution or flavocoxid (20 mg/kg/ip). methods morris water maze was used to assess learning and memory. histology was performed to evidence a beta plaques and neuronal loss, while inflammatory proteins were determined by western blot analysis. results saline-treated 3xtg-ad mice showed an impairment in spatial learning and memory (assessed at 6 months of age), and increased expression of inflammatory and apoptotic molecules. treatment of 3xtg-ad mice with flavocoxid reduced: (1) learning and memory loss; (2) the increased eicosanoid production and the phosphorylation level of amyloid precursor protein (app-pthr668), a beta 1-42, p-tau (pthr181), perk, and the activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome; (3) a beta plaques; and (4) neuronal loss, compared to saline-treated animals. conclusions pharmacological blockade of both cox-1/2 and 5-lox was able to counteract the progression of ad by targeting pathophysiological mechanisms up- and downstream of a beta and tau.
alzheimer's_disease	previously, we have described n-bz-l-glu[ nh-2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl) ethyl]-o-nhex (iqm9.21, l-1) as an interesting multifunctional neuroprotective compound for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. here, we describe new derivatives and different synthetic routes, such as chemoenzymatic and solid-phase synthesis, aiming to improve the previously described route in solution. the lipase-catalysed amidation of l-and d-glu diesters with n-benzyl-4-(2-aminoethyl) piperidine has been studied, using candida antarctica and mucor miehei lipases. in all cases, the alpha-amidated compound was obtained as the main product, pointing out that regioselectivity was independent of the reacting glu enantiomer and the nature of the lipase. an efficient solid-phase route has been used to produce new donepezil-based l-and d-glu derivatives, resulting in good yield. at micromolar concentrations, the new compounds inhibited human cholinesterases and protected neurons against toxic insults related to alzheimer 's disease and cerebral ischemia. the cns-permeable compounds n-cbz-l-glu(oet)-[ nh-2-(1benzylpiperidin-4-yl) ethyl] (l-3) and l-1 blocked the voltage-dependent calcium channels and l-3 protected rat hippocampal slices against oxygen-glucose deprivation, becoming promising antialzheimer and anti-stroke lead compounds.

alzheimer's_disease	this study investigates the neuroprotective properties of berberine (a natural isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the rhizoma coptidis) and finds that berberine could promote beta-amyloid (a beta) clearance and inhibit a beta production in the triple-transgenic mouse model of alzheimer 's disease (3 x tg-ad). during the study, berberine was first administrated to treat 3 x tg-ad mice and primary neurons. morris water maze assay, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), immunofluorescence staining and histological analysis, transmission electron microscopic analysis were then used to evaluate the effects of the berberine administration. the result showed that berberine significantly improved 3 x tg-ad mice 's spatial learning capacity and memory retention, promoted autophagy activity identified by the enhancement of brain lo-ii, beclin-1, hvps34, and cathepsin-d levels as well as the reduction of brain p62 and bcl-2 levels in ad mice, facilitated reduction of av, and app levels, reduced a beta plaque deposition in the hippocampus of ad mice, and inhibited b-site app cleavage enzyme 1 (bace1) expression. similar results were also found in 3 x tg-ad primary hippocampal neurons: berbernine treatment decreased the levels of extracellular and intracellular a beta 1-42, increased the protein levels of 10-11, beclin-1, hvps34, and cathepsin-d, and decreased the levels of p62. bcl-2, app and bace1 levels. in summary, berberine shows neuroprotective effects on 3 x tg-ad mice and may be a promising multitarget drug in the preventionand protection against ad.

parkinson's_disease	aimwe investigated preclinical abnormalities as revealed by transcranial sonography (tcs) in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (irbd) compared with those revealed in patients with multiple system atrophy (msa) or parkinson 's disease (pd) and in normal controls. methodstwenty-two patients with irbd, 21 patients with msa, 22 patients with pd, and 21 normal controls were included in this study. all participants underwent one night of video-polysomnography monitoring, and the sleep parameters were analyzed using polysmith software and by visual analysis. tcs was performed following a standardized procedure. the echogenicity of the substantia nigra and basal ganglia were evaluated. resultsa greater proportion of pd patients were found to have substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (86.4%) when compared to irbd patients (31.8%), msa patients (23.8%), and normal controls (4.8%) (p < 0.001). fourteen msa patients (66.7%) and 11 irbd patients (50.0%) had hyperechogenicity in the basal ganglia, whereas hyperechogenicity in the basal ganglia was less frequent in pd patients (18.2%) and normal controls (9.5%) (p < 0.001). poor sleep efficiency, less stage ii sleep time, and more periodic leg movements were found in msa and pd patients, whereas irbd patients had almost normal sleep. conclusionsome irbd patients had basal ganglia hyperechogenicity that was similar to that observed in msa, which may represent another possible convert direction. the present study further confirmed irbd as a prodromal stage of synucleinopathy. tcs could detect subclinical changes and thus might provide useful markers for identifying individuals at increased risk for developing a synucleinopathy.
parkinson's_disease	mutations in the gba and lrrk2 genes account for one-third of the prevalence of parkinson 's disease (pd) in ashkenazi jews. non-manifesting carriers (nmc) of these mutations represent a population at risk for future development of pd. pd patient who carry mutations in the gba gene demonstrates more significant cognitive decline compared to idiopathic pd patients. we assessed cognitive domains using fmri among nmc of both lrrk2 and gba mutations to better understand pre-motor cognitive functions in these populations. twenty-one lrrk2-nmc, 10 gba-nmc, and 22 non-manifesting non-carriers (nmnc) who participated in this study were evaluated using the standard questionnaires and scanned while performing two separate cognitive tasks; a stroop interference task and an n-back working memory task. cerebral activation patterns were assessed using both whole brain and predefined region of interest (roi) analysis. subjects were well matched in all demographic and clinical characteristics. on the stroop task, in spite of similar behavior, gba-nmc demonstrated increased task-related activity in the right medial frontal gyrus and reduced task-related activity in the left lingual gyrus compared to both lrrk2-nmc and nmnc. in addition, gba-nmc had higher activation patterns in the incongruent task compared to nmnc in the left medial frontal gyrus and bilateral precentral gyrus. no whole-brain differences were noted between groups on the n-back task. paired cognitive and task-related performance between gba-nmc, lrrk2-nmc, and nmnc could indicate that the higher activation patterns in the incongruent stroop condition among gba-nmc compared to lrrk2-nmc and nmnc may represent a compensatory mechanism that enables adequate cognitive performance.
parkinson's_disease	background: although the dopamine precursor l-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa) remains the gold standard pharmacological therapy for patients with parkinson 's disease (pd), long-term treatment with this drug has been known to result in several adverse effects, including l-dopa-induced dyskinesia (lid). recently, our group reported that kd5040, a modified herbal remedy, had neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of pd. thus, the present study investigated whether kd5040 would have synergistic effects with l-dopa and antidyskinetic effects caused by l-dopa as well. methods: the effects of kd5040 and l-dopa on motor function, expression levels of substance p (sp) and enkephalin (enk) in the basal ganglia, and glutamate content in the motor cortex were assessed using behavioral assays, immunohistochemistry, western blot analyses, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in a mouse model of pd induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp). in addition, the antidyskinetic effects of kd5040 on pathological movements triggered by l-dopa were investigated by testing abnormal involuntary movements (aims) and measuring the activations of fosb, camp-dependent phosphor protein of 32 kda (darpp-32), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk), and camp response element-binding (creb) protein in the striatum. results: kd5040 synergistically improved the motor function when low-dose l-dopa (ll) was co-administered. in addition, it significantly reversed mptp-induced lowering of sp, improved enk levels in the basal ganglia, and ameliorated abnormal reduction in glutamate content in the motor cortex. furthermore, kd5040 significantly lowered aims and controlled abnormal levels of striatal fosb, pdarpp-32, perk, and pcreb induced by high-dose l-dopa. conclusions: kd5040 lowered the effective dose of l-dopa and alleviated lid. these findings suggest that kd5040 may be used as an adjunct therapy to enhance the efficacy of l-dopa and alleviate its adverse effects in patients with pd.
parkinson's_disease	botulinum neurotoxin type a (bnt-a) intrasalivary gland injections in patients with neurological disorders have been known to effectively treat hypersalivation. however, oral health can be compromised with increasing the dose. the aim of this study was to find out the therapeutic effect of low-dose, ultrasonography-controlled bnt-a injections into the bilateral parotid and submandibular glands on oral health in the treatment of sialorrhea. twenty patients diagnosed with parkinson 's disease (pd), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), and other neurological disorders, including stroke or birth trauma, received bnt-a injections with salivary tests before and 1 month after the injections. drooling was evaluated using subjective scales and objective assessment of salivary flow rate and oral health (salivary composition and cariogenic bacterial counts). a significant decrease was found in salivary flow rate at 1- and 3-month follow-up in the bnt-a treated group. there was no significant change in salivary composition or cariogenic bacterial counts. bnt-a injections according to the current protocol can effectively manage sialorrhea while maintaining oral health. oral health can be considered the mirror of general human health, as the cause of many diseases. saliva plays a crucial role in protecting the oral cavity. the present study is of high clinical relevance because, although earlier research has proved the effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a injections on reduction in saliva flow, data about the risks of the treatment method to the oral condition through affecting saliva composition has so far been missing.
parkinson's_disease	purpose: quality-of-life (qol) consists of health, psychological well-being and communication-related domains. due to the heterogeneous nature of parkinson disease (pd), it is important to examine effects of different domains including motor and cognitive performance or motor and speech performance among the same set of individuals. existing studies indicate mixed findings due to use of different qol measures and lack of general consensus regarding qol components. method: the present study examined self and proxy ratings for 20 individuals with pd on voice handicap index (vhi) and pdq-39 mobility to determine effects on speech and motor-related qol, respectively. result: there was good level of agreement between self and proxy ratings for pdq-39 mobility ratings alone. in addition, no overall group differences were found for self and proxy ratings of vhi and pdq-39 mobility ratings, thus indicating similar perceptions by individuals with pd and their communication partners for speech and motor-related changes associated with pd. further, no significant correlations between speech and motor-related qol were found, thereby suggesting these domains to be independent of each other. conclusion: the present study indicates the need to consider both self and proxy reports to understand the impact of pd on a person 's overall functioning.
parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by age-related death of dopaminergic (da) neurons in the substantia nigra (sn). mitochondrial dna (mtdna) deletions rise exponentially with age in humans and reach their highest levels approaching 60% in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and overlap with dying neurons. parkin deletion causes parkinsonism in humans, presumably through a decrease in mitochondrial quality control, but parkin knockout mice do not have da neurodegeneration. we crossed parkin knockouts to the twinkle-tg mouse in which mtdna deletions are increased specifically in substantia nigra to determine the effect of increased deletion mutagenesis in the absence of mitochondrial quality control. these double-mutant 'twinkpark' mice had 1, the highest mtdna deletion concentration in sn; 2, the lowest mitochondria( function and membrane potential; 3, the most severe neurobehavioral deficits at 19 months; 4, the least dopaminergic neurons in the sn and lowest dopamine levels, i.e. parkinsonism. this mouse model could provide novel insights into the pathomechanism by which a specific increase in mtdna deletions with age contribute to dopaminergic neurodegeneration and parkinson 's disease.

parkinson's_disease	variants in the ric3 gene have recently been suggested as a novel cause of parkinson 's disease (pd). herein, the entire ric3 gene was sequenced in a french-canadian and french sample series of 535 pd patients and 527 unaffected controls. the effect of single variants and the combined effect of variants were calculated. sequence kernel association tests (skat, skat-o) were done on the entire gene level, and on the different domains and exons of ric3. a total of 28 common and rare variants were identified in patients and controls. no significant association was found between any variant and haplotype in ric3 and pd, and there was no over-representation of ric3 variants at the entire gene, domain, or exon levels in patients versus controls. our results do not support a role for ric3 mutations as a common cause of pd in the french-canadian and french populations.

parkinson's_disease	carthamus tinctorius l, or safflower, is an annual herbaceous crop belonging to the family asteraceae, which is cultivated throughout china and used as a traditional chinese medicine. our previous study revealed anti-parkinson 's disease effects of an isolated standardized safflower flavonoid extract (safe). the purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential sub-chronic toxicity of safe. male and female sprague dawley rats received three doses of safe (100, 300, and 500 mg/kg) q.d. by gavage for four weeks. body weights were measured during the experiment, and blood samples were collected once per week for hematological and serum biochemical parameters. major organs were examined after execution and histopathological analyses were performed. body weight gain in the administration groups showed no decline compared to the control group. however, there were changes in values of aspartate transaminase (p < 0.05), alanine transaminase (p < 0.05), and blood glucose (p < 0.05) between treatments. safe influenced parameters related to platelets in rats receiving safe for both sexes under different dosages (p < 0.05). no histopathological changes were observed. safe might have influence on conglomeration of platelets, transaminases, and blood glucose. safe caused no significant toxicity and further studies may be needed to ensure safety of safe.

parkinson's_disease	previous studies have shown that asymmetries in upper limb sensorimotor function are dependent on the source of sensory and motor information, hand preference and differences in hand strength. further, the utilization of sensory and motor information and the mode of control of force may differ between the right hand/ left hemisphere and left hand/ right hemisphere systems. to more clearly understand the unique contribution of hand strength and intrinsic differences to the control of grasp force, we investigated hand/ hemisphere differences when the source of force information was encoded at two different force levels corresponding to a 20 and 70% maximum voluntary contraction or the right and left hand of each participant. eleven, adult males who demonstrated a stronger right than left maximum grasp force were requested to match a right or left hand 20 or 70% maximal voluntary contraction reference force with the opposite hand. during the matching task, visual feedback corresponding to the production of the reference force was available and then removed when the contralateral hand performed the match. the matching relative force error was significantly different between hands for the 70% mvc reference force but not for the 20% mvc reference force. directional asymmetries, quantified as the matching force constant error, showed right hand overshoots and left undershoots were force dependent and primarily due to greater undershoots when matching with the left hand the right hand reference force. findings further suggest that the interaction between internal sources of information, such as efferent copy and proprioception, as well as hand strength differences appear to be hand/ hemisphere system dependent. investigations of force matching tasks under conditions whereby force level is varied and visual feedback of the reference force is available provides critical baseline information for building effective interventions for asymmetric (stroke-related, parkinson 's disease) and symmetric (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) upper limb recovery of neurological conditions where the various sources of sensory -motor information have been significantly altered by the disease process.
parkinson's_disease	opicapone is a novel potent, reversible and purely peripheral catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibitor that has been developed to be used as an adjunct to levodopa/aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor therapy for parkinson 's disease. thus, this study aimed to compare the plasma pharmacokinetics of opicapone and its active metabolite (bia 9-1079) after the administration of single and multiple oral doses to rats. wistar rats (n = 8 per group) were orally treated with single (30, 60 or 90 mg/kg) or multiple (30 mg/kg once-daily for seven consecutive days) oral doses of opicapone. blood samples were collected up to 24 h post-dosing through a cannula introduced in the tail vein of rats. after quantifying opicapone and bia 9-1079 in plasma, a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. opicapone was quickly absorbed (time to reach the maximum plasma concentration 2 h) in both dosage regimens and the extent of systemic exposure to opicapone increased approximately in a dose-proportional manner after single-dosing within the studied dose range (30-90 mg/kg). opicapone and bia 9-1079 showed a relatively short plasma elimination half-life (1.58-4.50 h) and a small systemic accumulation after multiple-dosing. hence, no pharmacokinetic concerns are expected when opicapone is administered with a once-daily dosing regimen.

sprains_and_strains	nonpharmacological treatment strategies for acute musculoskeletal injury revolve around pain reduction and promotion of healing in order to facilitate a return to normal function and activity. heat and cold therapy modalities are often used to facilitate this outcome despite prevalent confusion about which modality (heat vs cold) to use and when to use it. most recommendations for the use of heat and cold therapy are based on empirical experience, with limited evidence to support the efficacy of specific modalities. this literature review provides information for practitioners on the use of heat and cold therapies based on the mechanisms of action, physiological effects, and the medical evidence to support their clinical use. the physiological effects of cold therapy include reductions in pain, blood flow, edema, inflammation, muscle spasm, and metabolic demand. there is limited evidence from randomized clinical trials (rcts) supporting the use of cold therapy following acute musculoskeletal injury and delayed-onset muscle soreness (doms). the physiological effects of heat therapy include pain relief and increases in blood flow, metabolism, and elasticity of connective tissues. there is limited overall evidence to support the use of topical heat in general; however, rcts have shown that heat-wrap therapy provides short-term reductions in pain and disability in patients with acute low back pain and provides significantly greater pain relief of doms than does cold therapy. there remains an ongoing need for more sufficiently powered high-quality rcts on the effects of cold and heat therapy on recovery from acute musculoskeletal injury and doms.
sprains_and_strains	in order to describe accidents at work at a hospital in northern portugal and analyze their main impact in the period from 2008 to 2010, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. the information was obtained from the notification records of accidents at work for 387 workers. the highest prevalence levels of accidents referred to superior health technician (56.1%), female workers (81.9%), in the age group 30-39 years (37.2%), with a secondary education degree (55.8%), working in shifts (72.4%) and in-patient services (35.9%). needle pricks were the main cause (45.7%) and hands were the main injury location (37.5%). wounds (32.6%) were the most frequent type of injury, followed by sprains and strains (23%). in total, 27.4% resulted in absence from work, with sprains and strains as the main reason. preventive strategies should be adopted, aiming to promote these workers' health.
sprains_and_strains	objectives: it has been reported that obtaining an adduction-to-abduction strength ratio of 90-100%, and an adduction strength equal to that of the uninjured side, are suitable clinical milestones for return to sport following groin injury. little is known about hip adduction and abduction strength profiles in australian footballers. this study aimed to compare isometric hip adduction and abduction strength profiles between preferred and non-preferred kicking legs in elite, sub-elite and amateur australian footballers. design: cross sectional study methods: 36 elite, 19 sub-elite and 18 amateur australian footballers, with a mean age of 24, 19 and 23 years respectively, were included. maximal hip isometric adduction and abduction strength were measured using a hand held dynamometer with external belt fixation. results: there were no significant differences in isometric hip adduction (p = 0.262) or abduction (p = 0.934) strength, or the adduction-to-abduction ratio (p = 0.163), between preferred and non preferred kicking legs, regardless of playing level. elite players had significantly greater isometric hip adduction and abduction strength than both sub-elite (mean difference; adduction = 46.01 n, p < 0.001, abduction = 30.79 n, p = 0.003) and amateur players (mean difference; adduction = 78.72 n, p < 0.001, abduction = 59.11 n, p < 0.001). there was no significant difference in the adduction-to-abduction ratio between the playing levels (p = 0.165). conclusions: no significant differences were found between preferred and non-preferred kicking legs across the playing levels for isometric hip adduction, abduction or the adduction-to-abduction ratio. this may have implications for developing groin injury prediction and return to sport criteria in australian footballers.

sprains_and_strains	objective: to investigate the predictive validity of fear avoidance beliefs as assessed by the work subscale (fabq-w) of the fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire in a sample of 117 patients with a work-related musculoskeletal disorder, and identify two fabq-w cut off points that identified participants as high or low risk of non return to work, following an interdisciplinary rehabilitation program. methods: a retrospective analysis of patient data collected in conjunction with the victorian workcover authority ""sprains and strains"" program. sequential logistic regression analysis was used to construct a model of prediction from the baseline variables of age, disability (using the pain disability index), gender and fabq-w scores. receiver operator characteristic (roc) curves were used to identify fabq-w cut off points that best predicted the return to work outcome. results: age and initial fabq-w scores significantly improved the predictive capabilities of the model, but gender and disability did not. the model explained between 13.1% and 18.2% of the variability in the rtw outcome. roc curves showed maximum sensitivity was 100% for a score of39.5 identified as having optimum specificity (81.9%). conclusion: individuals with low fabq-w scores are likely to return to work, however those with high scores will not necessarily have a poor outcome. this study supports the limited utility of the fabq-w score for screening for risk of a poor return to work outcome in patients with a work related musculoskeletal disorder.
sprains_and_strains	purpose: this study describes the influence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) on the incidence rates of selected injuries. methods: a retrospective cohort study design was employed using medical claims data from the deseret mutual benefit administrators (dmba), a health insurance company for employees of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds) and their spouses and dependent children. adhd diagnosis, injury, medication, and demographic data were extracted from claims files during 1998-2005 for all enrollees aged 0-64 years. results: incidence rates of adhd were 1.83 (95% ci 1.68-2.00) times greater in males than females and highest in the age group 5-9 years and income group $80,000 or greater. adhd increased the risk of selected injuries. the most common injuries involved sprains and strains of joints, then open wounds of the head, neck and trunk, and upper/lower limb, and then fractures of the upper/lower limb. medication did not significantly protect against injury in adhd patients. the rate of severe injury (i.e., fracture of skull, neck and trunk; intracranial injury excluding those with skull fracture; and injuries to nerves and spinal cord) was 3.07 (95% ci 2.37-3.98) times more common in adhd enrollees compared with non-adhd enrollees. those with 1, 2, 3, or 4 or more injuries were 1.67 (1.50-1.86), 2.11 (1.75-2.56), 2.63 (1.80-3.84), and 2.94 (1.47-5.87) times more likely to have adhd, respectively. conclusions: adhd is positively associated with injuries. more severe injuries have a significantly stronger associated with adhd than less severe injuries.
sprains_and_strains	objective.-this paper describes field injury, illness, near miss, and evacuation profiles of the national outdoor leadership school (nols). methods.-the nols incident database is used to record injuries, illnesses, near-miss incidents (close calls), evacuations, and nonmedical incidents. the database has been used continually since 1984. results.-during the period september 1, 1998, through august 31, 2002, there were 630 937 program days on which 1940 incidents were reported involving 1679 students and 233 staff. athletic injuries account for 50% of all injuries, and soft-tissue injuries account for 30%. athletic injuries are most often sprains and strains of knees (35%), ankles (30%), and backs (13%). falls and slips around camp or while hiking are the leading contributing factors. the most common illnesses are gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (26.4%) and all flu-like illness, including flu symptoms and respiratory symptoms (16.6%). rock fall was the leading near-miss incident. two hundred fifty-seven (53%) medical evacuees received treatment and were able to rejoin and finish their course. there was one fatality from 1999 to 2002. the fatality rate for this period is 0.002 per 1000 program days. conclusions.-the number of injuries and, specifically, the number of athletic injuries have declined. the number and rate of near-miss incidents increased as a result of better reporting; the rate of nonmedical incidents held steady. motivation continues to be our leading category of nonmedical incident. efforts at collecting incident data provide a useful measurement from which we can gauge our risk-management performance.

cancer	histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor abexinostat is under investigation for the treatment of various cancers. epigenetic changes including aberrant hdac activity are associated with cancers, including myelodysplastic syndromes (mds), acute myeloid leukemia (aml), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all). in this phase 1 dose-escalation study, 17 patients with relapsed/refractory higher-risk mds, aml, or all received oral abexinostat (60, 80 [starting dose], 100, or 120mg) twice daily (bid) on days 1-14 of 21-day cycles. the most common treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (29%) and neutropenia (24%), none of which led to discontinuation. maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. of 12 evaluable patients, best response was stable disease in 1 patient. this study was closed due to limited clinical benefit. future development of oral abexinostat 100mg bid in patients with mds, aml, or all should focus on combination regimens.isrctn registry: 99680465
cancer	to date, the natural alkaloids are mostly used in the field of pharmacological applications and the active substance of palmatine was extensively used in cancer therapy and other biomedical applications. hence, in this study we report a simple preparation of poly-l-lysine (pll) electro-polymerized on the surface of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-mwcnt) for electrochemical detection of palmatine content in human serum and urine samples. the active amino group of pll plays a vital role towards the oxidation palmatine and exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity. under optimum conditions, the prepared f-mwcnt/pll composite shows a wide linear response range over the palmatine concentration ranging from 0.5 mu m to 425 mu m, and a detection limit (lod) of 0.12 mu m based on s/n = 3 (signal to noise ratio). the real time monitoring of palmatine content in serum and urine samples displays an appropriate recoveries and excellent performance for the practical analysis. the advantage of this developed system was simple, higher electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability and low cost. we hope that the prepared composite opens a new way for the fabrication of different biosensors in the field of biomedical application.

cancer	whether long non-coding rna (lncrna) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) affect prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (aml) remains unknown. to search the association between lncrna snps and aml outcomes, thirty tagsnps in five lncrnas were genotyped in 313 aml patients. survival analysis indicated that gas5 rs55829688 (t>c) was significantly associated with prognosis of aml (p=0.018). patients with rs55829688cc genotype showed higher gas5 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) (p=0.025) and harbored a longer platelets recovery (p=0.040) than carriers of rs55829688t allele. in vitro study indicated that gas5 promoter harboring the rs55829688c allele showed marginally increased reporter gene activity (p=0.019), and the promoter activity was increased by tp63 in a dose-dependent manner (p=0.001). moreover, gas5 higher expression predict shorter aml overall survival (os), which validated in geo gse12417 dataset (p=0.011). in conclusion, rs55829688 polymorphism could increase gas5 expression by interacting with tp63, which might aggravate the myelosuppression and in turn lead to poor prognosis in aml. trail registration number: chictr-ppc-14005297.
cancer	surgical resection is the standard treatment for localized colorectal cancer, which is the most common type of gastrointestinal cancer. however, over 40 % cases are diagnosed metastasized and apparently inoperable. systemic chemotherapy provides an alternative to these patients. this study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of liposomal doxorubicin (lipodox) in combination with liposomal vinorelbine (lipovnb) in a ct-26 colon carcinoma-bearing mouse model. the in vitro cytotoxicity of dox and vnb on ct-26 cancer cells was determined by mtt and colony formation assays. mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 2 x 10(5) of ct-26 cells in the right hind flank. when tumor size reached 200 +/- 50 mm(3), mice were assigned to receive different treatment protocols. the pharmacokinetics, micro single-photon emission computed tomography/x-ray computed tomography imaging, biodistribution, and immunohistochemical staining studies were performed to survey the therapeutic efficacy of each regimen. based on the results of pharmacokinetic study, co-administration of lipodox and lipovnb did not affect their individual systemic distribution, while lipodox retained longer in blood than lipovnb did. superior tumor growth retardation was observed in the group received lipodox plus lipovnb administration (1 mg/kg each, namely d1v1) than those injected with lipodox plus vnb (1 mg/kg each, namely d(1)fv(1)). no severe side effects were detected in each group. the tumor-to-muscle ratio (t/m) derived from 3'-dexoy-3'-[f-18]fluorothymidine ([f-18]flt) micro positron emission tomography (pet) images of d1v1- and d(1)fv(1)-treated mice and the controls on day 7 was 6.88 +/- 0.54, 7.50 +/- 0.84, and 9.87 +/- 0.73, respectively, suggesting that d1v1 is a more efficacious regimen against ct-26 xenografts. the results of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) immunohistochemical staining were consistent with those findings obtained from [f-18]flt micropet imaging. this study demonstrated that lipodox in combination with lipovnb was more efficacious than clinically used regimen, lipodox plus vnb, in the treatment of colon carcinoma and [f-18]flt-pet is a promising approach in monitoring the treatment outcome at early stage.
cancer	sampangine is an azaoxoaporphine alkaloid with interesting biological activities. elucidating the mode of action of sampangine is a topic of continuous research. recently reported cell-based data have indicated heme-dysfunction and subsequent reactive oxygen species production as being responsible for the biological activity of the natural product. by using an in vitro biochemical assay the ability of sampangine to produce reactive oxygen species was confirmed. the production of reactive oxygen species occurred upon mild chemical reduction of sampangine in absence of any cellular components. in an additional structure-activity-relationship study, utilizing synthesized analogs of sampangine, we identified the 1,4-iminoquinone scaffold as the key motif for the observed reactive oxygen species production. to assess the ability of sampangine to induce dna damage, the direct binding of sampangine to calf thymus-dna was measured using uv-visible spectroscopy. no dna binding was observed when sampangine was tested against calf thymus -dna up to a ratio of 1:100. this observation rules out the direct involvement of sampangine in dna binding and damage.
cancer	we report on the use of one-dimensional photonic crystals to detect clinically relevant concentrations of erbb2/neu/her2 in cell lysates. erbb2 is a pivotal breast cancer biomarker and targetable oncogenic driver associated with aggressive breast cancer subtypes. to quantitate soluble erbb2, we developed an optical platform that combines label-free and fluorescence detection modes. such platform makes use of a sandwich assay in which the one-dimensional photonic crystals sustaining bloch surface waves are tailored with a monoclonal antibody for highly specific biological recognition (bsw biochip). in a second step, a second antibody to erbb2 quantitatively detects the bound analyte. the strategy of the present approach takes advantage of the combination of label-free and fluorescence techniques, making bio-recognition more robust and sensitive. in the fluorescence operation mode, the platform can attain the limit of detection 0.3 ng/ml (1.5 pm) for erbb2 in cell lysates. such resolution meets the international guidelines and recommendations (15 ng/ml) for diagnostic erbb2 assays that in the future may help to more precisely assign therapies counteracting cancer cell proliferation and metastatic spread.
cancer	statistical properties of light waves reflected from a one-dimensional (1d) disordered optical medium [n(x) = n(0) + dn(x),= 0] have been well studied, however, most of the studies have focused on the situation when the mean refractive index of the optical medium matched with the outside medium, i.e., n(0) = n(out) = 1. further, considering dn(x) as a gaussian color noise refractive index medium with exponential spatial correlation decay length le and k as the incident wave vector, it has been shown that for smaller correlation length limit, i.e., kl(c) < < 1, both the mean reflection coefficientand std of r, sigma(r), have same value, and they follow the relation= sigma(r) proportional tol(c). however, when the refractive index of the sample medium is different from the outside medium, the reflection statistics may have interesting features, which has not been well studied or understood. we studied the reflection statistics of a 1d weakly disordered optical medium with the mean background refractive index no being different from the outside medium n(out) (not equal n(o)), to see the effect of mismatching (i.e., value of n(o) - n(out)) on the reflection statistics. in the mismatched case, the results show that the mean reflection coefficientfollows a form similar to that of the matched refractive-index case, i.e.,proportional tolc, with a linear increased shift, which is due to 1d uniform background reflection from a slab. however, sigma(r) is shown to be sigma(r) proportional to (l(c))(1/2), which is different from the matched case. this change in std of r is attributed to the interference between the mismatched-crerated edge mediated multiple scattering that are coupled with the random scattering. applications to light scattering from random layered media and biological cells are discussed.
cancer	in this paper, we present the novel design features, their technical implementation, and an evaluation of the radio frequency exposure systems developed for the national toxicology program (ntp) of the national institute of environmental health sciences studies on the potential toxicity and carcinogenicity of second and third generation mobile-phone signals. the system requirements for this second-year ntp cancer bioassay study were the tightly controlled lifetime exposure of rodents (1568 rats and 1512 mice) to three power levels plus sham simulating typical daily, and higher, exposures of users of gsm and cdma (is95) signals. reverberation chambers and animal housing were designed to allow extended exposure time per day for free-roaming individually housed animals. the performance of the chamber was characterized in terms of homogeneity, stirred to unstirred energy and efficiency. the achieved homogeneity was 0.59 and 0.48 db at 900 and 1900 mhz, respectively. the temporal variation in the electric field strength was optimized to give similar characteristics to that of the power control of a phone in a real network using the two stirrers. experimental dosimetry was performed to validate the sar sensitivity and determine the sar uniformity throughout the exposure volume; sar uniformities of 0.46 and 0.40 db, respectively, for rats and mice were achieved.
cancer	our purpose as to evaluate the impact of adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy (rai) on prognosis, as assessed by progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os), in patients affected by differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) lymph-node relapse and previously treated with lymphadenectomy. we retrospectively evaluated dtc patients treated with lymph-node dissection for disease relapse. all patients had previously undergone total thyroidectomy and radioiodine remnant ablation (rra). we used clinical and histological data obtained during follow-up to assess response and outcome. by means of univariate and multivariate time-to-event analyses, we assessed the impact of rai on outcome (pfs and os) and the prognostic role of thyroglobulin (tg) levels under suppression with levothyroxine (tg-on) measured 1-3 months after lymphadenectomy and of other risk factors. we evaluated 113 patients (age at diagnosis: median 41 years, interquartile range: 31-59), 64 of whom were treated with rai. over a median follow-up time of 5.7 years, 27 patients showed disease progression and 13 died. kaplan-meier pfs and os curves showed that age on diagnosis, tumor histology, tumor size, dtc aggressive variant, and tg-on were associated with prognosis. patients with tg-on ae1 ng/ml treated with rai showed a better pfs (log-rank pp 0.001) and os (p = 0.005) than untreated patients, while no effect of rai was observed in patients with tg-on < 1 ng/ml. multivariate models showed that age, tg-on (ae1 vs. < 1 ng/ml, hr: 18.2, 95% ci: 5.09-64.8, p = 0.001) and rai (yes vs. no, hr: 0.36,95%ci: 0.15-0. 9, p = 0.02) remained the only independent factors associated with pfs, but only age and tg-on remained significantly associated with os (hr: 8.31, 95%ci:1.56-44.3, p = 0.01). nonetheless, patients treated with rai showed a lower risk of mortality (hr: 0.34, 95%ci: 0.1-1.15 p = 0.08) than untreated patients. rai after lymphadenectomy for dtc relapse is significantly associated with better pfs only in patients with tg-on ae1 ng/ml.
cancer	the cancer stem cell model claims that the initiation, maintenance, and growth of a tumor are driven by a small population of cancer cells termed, cancer stem cells. cancer stem cells possess a variety of phenotypes associated with therapeutic resistance and often cause recurrence of the diseases. several strategies have been investigated to target cancer stem cells in a variety of cancers, such as blocking one or more self-renewal signaling pathways, reducing the expression of drug efflux and atp-binding cassette efflux transporters, modulating epigenetic aberrations, and promoting cancer stem cell differentiation. a number of cell and animal studies strongly support the potential benefits of combining chemotherapeutic drugs with cancer stem cell targeting agents. clinical trials are still underway to address the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of combination treatment. this mini-review provides an updated discussion of these preclinical and clinical studies.

sports_injuries	osteochondral defects, impingement, and instability of the ankle are common injuries in athletes. in this article, we review these diagnoses and their treatment options, with a focus on arthroscopic approaches. the treatment options continue to evolve, supported by innovation and outcome studies. in this article, we describe the advantages and disadvantages of both open and arthroscopic treatments using published evidence.
sports_injuries	medical services at the glasgow 2014 commonwealth games (cwg) were provided though a purpose-built medical polyclinic, which had a fully equipped radiology department along with other services, set up within the main games village. data analysis of radiology services offered at cwg has not been published before. imaging services within the polyclinic, athletes village, glasgow 2014 cwg. the aim of the paper is to analyse data on radiological investigations and assess the demand and distribution of workload on imaging services at cwg 2014. data on radiology investigations at the cwg 2014 was retrieved from the carestream picture archiving and communication system (pacs) and pharmasys (cwg official centralised electronic database system) and analysed. six hundred ninety-seven diagnostic and interventional procedures were performed. of these 37.9 % were magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans, 22 % were diagnostic ultrasound (us) examinations, 33.1 % were radiographs, 4.3 % were computed tomography (ct) scans and 2.7 % were imaging-guided interventional procedures. 88 % of imaging was performed on athletes and the remainder were performed on team officials and workforce. demand on radiology services gradually picked up through the pre-competition period and peaked half way through the cwg. radiology played a vital role in the successful provision of medical services at the glasgow 2014 cwg. high demand on imaging services can be expected at major international sporting events and therefore pre-event planning is vital. having back-up facilities in case of technical failure should be given due importance when planning radiology services at future cwg events.
sports_injuries	objectives: to investigate the association between training-related characteristics and running-related injury using a new conceptual model for running-related injury generation, focusing on the synergy between training load and previous injuries, short-term running experience or body mass index (>or <25 kg m(-2)). design: prospective cohort study with a 9-month follow-up. methods: the data of two previous studies using the same methodology were revisited. recreational runners (n = 517) reported information about running training characteristics (weekly distance, frequency, speed), other sport participation and injuries on a dedicated internet platform. weekly volume (dichotomized into= 2 h) and session frequency (dichotomized into= 2) were the main exposures because they were considered necessary causes for running-related injury. non-training-related characteristics were included in cox regression analyses as effect-measure modifiers. hazard ratio was the measure of association. the size of effect-measure modification was calculated as the relative excess risk due to interaction. results: one hundred sixty-seven runners reported a running-related injury. crude analyses revealed that weekly volume <2 h (hazard ratio =3.29; 95% confidence intervals = 2.27; 4.79) and weekly session frequency <2 (hazard ratio =2.41; 95% confidence intervals =1.71; 3.42) were associated with increased injury rate. previous injury was identified as an effect-measure modifier on weekly volume (relative excess risk due to interaction = 4.69; 95% confidence intervals = 1.42; 7.95; p = 0.005) and session frequency (relative excess risk due to interaction = 2.44; 95% confidence intervals = 0.48; 4.39; p = 0.015). a negative synergy was found between body mass index and weekly volume (relative excess risk due to interaction = -2.88; 95% confidence intervals = -5.10; -0.66; p = 0.018). conclusions: the effect of a runner 's training load on rurining-related injury is influenced by body mass index and previous injury. these results show the importance to distinguish between confounding and effect-measure modification in running-related injury research.

sports_injuries	aim. although physical activity brings a range of lifelong health benefits, it may also lead to injuries that pose a significant threat to health. it is particularly noticeable in people involved in professional sports where sport-related injuries commonly occur and are associated with intense exercise which aims to improve physical fitness. the article attempts to determine incidence of sports injuries reported by plus league volleyball players, as well as to identify their most common types and causes. methods. the research project involved 90 plus league volleyball players aged 18-37 with the average age of 25.11 (sd +/- 5.378). a method of diagnostic survey was applied to collect empirical data by means of questionnaire developed by the authors (researchers). the results were statistically analysed and verified with the analysis of variance (anova) and chi(2) test at the significance level (or critical p-value) of p <= 0.05 results. over 87% of the respondents suffered from at least one sport-related injury. in total, 362 injuries occurred, on average 4.02 injuries per one volleyball player. the most common sports injuries involved ankle or talocrural joint (46 injuries), knee and lower leg muscles (30), interphalangeal articulations of fingers (30) as well as shoulder joint. more than half of the injuries (57%) occurred twice or three times. volleyball players commonly sustain injuries through contact with an opposing player in competition. sport-specific injuries may also occur due to exhaustion, lack of rest and undertreated injuries. conclusion. the most common volleyball-related injuries are primarily talocrural joint, hand and shoulder injuries. common types of injuries that can affect volleyball players include muscles, joints and ligaments injuries, sprains and strains as well as bruises. most of these injuries are caused by exhaustion, contact with an opposing player during competition and fatigue. the incidence of sport-related injuries seems to be influenced by such factors as somatic features, jumping parameters and the length of professional volleyball career.
sports_injuries	background: athletes typically maintain rigorous training and work programs to be able to participate in competitions. an injury that occurs during the competition that causes withdrawal from the competition and a possible departure from sports, can render results athletes' and their support staff 's efforts as meaningless. the early detection of injuries in the competition and developing preventive training programs can help ensure that participating in competitions and the associated preparatory efforts are not wasted. in this study, the sports injuries discussed occurred during training and competition events of the turkish shooting sportive group. body parts of injuries are determined and exercise programs focused on the affected body parts are developed. methods: a total of 729 athletes (285 female, 444 male) who participated in turkish shooting sports championship during the 2010-2011 competition period participated in the study. athletes were given a questionnaire that was developed prior to the event, and the questionnaire was filled in during interviews conducted one-on-one. data was collected from the questionnaire and spss v.16.0 was used to analyze the results. the study was completed in six months. results: the results showed that the most of the injuries that occurred during training were strain and muscle tears whereas most of the injuries occurred during the actual competition were strain, muscle tears, tendinitis, and sprain. the results also indicated that during training, the most frequently-occurring injuries were in shoulder, calf-thigh, hand and wrist; whereas during the competition, it was manifested in the shoulder, foot and ankle. conclusions: muscle strengthening, stretching and proprioception exercises for these body parts should be included as part of the athletic training program.
sports_injuries	aims and objectivesto examine the cost-effectiveness of semi-rigid ankle brace to facilitate return to work following first-time acute ankle sprains. designeconomic evaluation based on cost-utility analysis. backgroundankle sprains are a source of morbidity and absenteeism from work, accounting for 15-20% of all sports injuries. semi-rigid ankle brace and taping are functional treatment interventions used by musculoskeletal physiotherapists and nurses to facilitate return to work following acute ankle sprains. methodsa decision model analysis, based on cost-utility analysis from the perspective of national health service was used. the primary outcomes measure was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, based on quality-adjusted life years. costs and quality of life data were derived from published literature, while model clinical probabilities were sourced from musculoskeletal physiotherapists. resultsthe cost and quality adjusted life years gained using semi-rigid ankle brace was 184 and 0.72 respectively. however, the cost and quality adjusted life years gained following taping was 155 and 0.61 respectively. the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the semi-rigid brace was 263 pound per quality adjusted life year. probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ankle brace provided the highest net-benefit, hence the preferred option. conclusiontaping is a cheaper intervention compared with ankle brace to facilitate return to work following first-time ankle sprains. however, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio observed for ankle brace was less than the national institute for health and care excellence threshold and the intervention had a higher net-benefit, suggesting that it is a cost-effective intervention. decision-makers may be willing to pay 263 pound for an additional gain in quality adjusted life year. relevance to clinical practicethe findings of this economic evaluation provide justification for the use of semi-rigid ankle brace by musculoskeletal physiotherapists and nurses to facilitate return to work in individuals with first-time ankle sprains.
sports_injuries	background: the incidence of lower extremity injuries in female soccer players is high, but the risk factors for injuries are unknown. purpose: to investigate risk factors for lower extremity injuries in elite female soccer players. study design: cohort study; level of evidence, 3. methods: players in the norwegian elite female soccer league (n = 12 teams) participated in baseline screening tests before the 2009 competitive soccer season. the screening included tests assessing maximal lower extremity strength, dynamic balance, knee valgus angles in a drop-jump landing, knee joint laxity, generalized joint laxity, and foot pronation. also included was a questionnaire to collect information on demographic data, elite-level experience, and injury history. time-loss injuries and exposure in training and matches were recorded prospectively in the subsequent soccer season using weekly text messaging. players reporting an injury were contacted to collect data regarding injury circumstances. univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for +/- 1 standard deviation of change. results: in total, 173 players underwent complete screening tests and registration of injuries and exposure throughout the season. a total of 171 injuries in 107 players (62%) were recorded; ligament and muscle injuries were the most frequent. multivariate analyses showed that a greater body mass index (bmi) (or, 1.51; 95% ci, 1.21-1.90; p = .001) was the only factor significantly associated with new lower extremity injuries. a greater bmi was associated with new thigh injuries (or, 1.51; 95% ci, 1.08-2.11; p = .01), a lower knee valgus angle in a drop-jump landing was associated with new ankle injuries (or, 0.64; 95% ci, 0.41-1.00; p = .04), and a previous knee injury was associated with new lower leg and foot injuries (or, 3.57; 95% ci, 1.27-9.99; p = .02), whereas none of the factors investigated influenced the risk of new knee injuries. conclusion: a greater bmi was associated with lower extremity injuries in elite female soccer players. clinical relevance: increased knowledge on risk factors for lower extremity injuries enables more targeted prevention strategies with the aim of reducing injury rates in female soccer players.
sports_injuries	methodological considerations of football injury epidemiology have only scarcely been described. the aim of this study was to evaluate the inter-rater agreement in injury capture rate and injury categorization for data registered in two different prospective injury surveillance audits studying the same two norwegian male professional football clubs for two consecutive seasons, 2008-2009. one audit used team-based exposure (tbe) recording and the other individual-based exposure (ibe). the number of injuries recorded and corresponding injury rates (injuries/1000 h exposure) were compared between audits. cohen 's kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (pabak) coefficients were calculated for injury variables. of 323 injuries included, the ibe audit captured 318 (overall capture rate 98.5%, training 98.9%, match 97.8%) and the tbe audit 303 injuries (overall capture rate 93.8%, training 91.4%, match 97.1%). agreement analysis showed kappa and pabak coefficients regarded as almost perfect (>0.81) for 8 of 9 injury variables, and substantial (k 0.75) for the variable injury severity. in conclusion, the capture rate for training injuries was slightly higher with ibe recording, and interagreement in injury categorization was very high.
sports_injuries	in recent years, physical continuous decline of students, and as the main strategy of school sports work is struggling, facing a ""degradation, desalination, weakening, marginalized"" deformity development, makes the school physical education, made way for a long time, absence, abdicated and status of the state. because at this stage there is no better way to solve the aftermath of a sports injury accident, school physical education to implement the ""moderate"", basic cancelled all kinds of fierce confrontation, have physical contact, may be the cause of sports injuries. sports teaching safety norms can regulate activities of the parties, can reduce accidents effectively.
sports_injuries	the mindfulness construct, defined as ""paying attention on purpose, in the present moment and nonjudgementally to the present experience"" (kabat-zinn, 1982) and considered part of the third generation techniques in cognitive-behavioural therapies, is being applied in several fields with benefits in important variables such as stress or anxiety levels, pain or life quality. it 's been recently used for the first time in sports psychology to increase the performance levels of athletes with very well defined programs (birrer, 2012). the aim of this article is to analyze the mindfulness-based interventions and see the potential benefits and advantages that mindfulness could bring in the prevention and rehabilitation of sports injuries.
senior_health	this study examined whether features of the built environment and residents' perceptions of neighborhood walkability, safety, and social cohesion were associated with self-reported physical activity (pa) and community-based activity among a sample of 190 older adults (mean age 74) residing in 8 denver neighborhoods. neighborhood walking audits were conducted to assess walkability and social capital. in multilevel analyses, a few walkability variables including curb cuts, crosswalks, and density of retail predicted greater frequency of walking for errands (p < .05), but mean frequency of walking for errands for this sample was low (< 1/wk). contrary to expectations, total pa and community-based activity were highest in neighborhoods with fewer walkability variables but higher respondent perceptions of safety and social cohesion (p <.01). for seniors, the importance of characteristics of the built environment in promoting pa and general activity engagement might be secondary to attributes of the social environment that promote safety and social cohesion.
senior_health	minimal research explores the impact of dementia and a dementia diagnosis on families from the unique vantage of senior health professionals. the participants of this study, eight senior aged care professionals, provided unique interpretative insights into family dynamics and sense-making on the journey with dementia, and their own role in that journey. both positive and negative perspectives were sought. data from semi-structured interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (ipa). one superordinate theme, dementia naivete; redefined intimacy, overarched embarrassed shame; maintaining hope; redefining a model of intimacy; and redefined relational intimacy and growth. within these themes, the participants shed light on hurtful embarrassment and shame experienced by families associated with the diagnostic label given to a loved one. this label was perceived to either trigger separation, hurt and immobility through ignorance, or precipitate a frenzy of naive yet hopeful energy for seeking that elusive cure. the participants saw their role as one of enacting a new way of connecting what was with what could be. thus, they modelled advocacy, integral care and relational intimacy. validation came in witnessing a redefining of intimacy in many families who were able to embrace that holistic and empathic approach to the shifting presentation of dementia. psychological well-being was observed to occur when families embraced growthful domains, e.g. acceptance, hope, relational closeness and altruistic concern for other families. implications for future care models are discussed.
senior_health	introduction: telehealth has been widely promoted as a technology to make healthcare more effective and affordable. however, current telehealth systems suffer from vendor lock-in and high cost, and are designed for managing chronic diseases rather than preventing them. methods: we address shortcomings of existing consumer-level health informatics applications in supporting senior health consumers, and provide designers of such systems with a design framework. we assess the feasibility of patient-centred health management systems (hmss) that are designed based on the proposed framework. in contrast to traditional telehealth, hmss are patient centred and aim at enabling health consumers to take control of their own health by providing functionality for health self-management. quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted in evaluating a prototype hms. results: senior healthcare consumers viewed our hms prototype positively, and experienced a positive change in their attitude towards their health. we identified requirements and challenges for hmss. in particular, participants indicated that social networking features must have a clear purpose beyond simple broadcasting of emotions and opinions. discussion: our study indicates that seniors are able and motivated to leverage a web-based patient-centred hms, provided that there are suitable health support applications tailored to their needs. this could be achieved by making it attractive for third party application developers to contribute hms content.
senior_health	background: national working groups identify the need for return on investment research conducted from the purchaser perspective; however, the field has not developed standardized methods for measuring the basic components of return on investment, including costing out the value of work productivity loss due to illness. recent literature is divided on whether the most commonly used method underestimates or overestimates this loss. the goal of this manuscript is to characterize between and within variation in the cost of work productivity loss from illness estimated by the most commonly used method and its two refinements. methods: one senior health benefit specialist from each of 325 companies employing 100+ workers completed a cross-sectional survey describing their company size, industry and policies/practices regarding work loss which allowed the research team to derive the variables needed to estimate work productivity loss from illness using three methods. compensation estimates were derived by multiplying lost work hours from presenteeism and absenteeism by wage/fringe. disruption correction adjusted this estimate to account for co-worker disruption, while friction correction accounted for labor substitution. the analysis compared bootstrapped means and medians between and within these three methods. results: the average company realized an annual $617 (sd = $75) per capita loss from depression by compensation methods and a $649 (sd = $78) loss by disruption correction, compared to a $316 (sd = $58) loss by friction correction (p < .0001). agreement across estimates was 0.92 (95% ci 0.90, 0.93). conclusion: although the methods identify similar companies with high costs from lost productivity, friction correction reduces the size of compensation estimates of productivity loss by one half. in analyzing the potential consequences of method selection for the dissemination of interventions to employers, intervention developers are encouraged to include friction methods in their estimate of the economic value of interventions designed to improve absenteeism and presenteeism. business leaders in industries where labor substitution is common are encouraged to seek friction corrected estimates of return on investment. health policy analysts are encouraged to target the dissemination of productivity enhancing interventions to employers with high losses rather than all employers.
senior_health	introduction: poor adherence to infection control standards among health care professionals is widespread, putting patients at substantial risk. basic infection control skills are typically learned uniprofessionally outside the clinical environment. in real clinical settings, the cognitive load associated with simultaneously managing challenging clinical problems as part of an interprofessional team compounds difficulties in applying infection control standards. this mixed methods study evaluated an interprofessional education infection control module as part of a larger action research project aimed at developing interprofessional health education using simulation. methods: students from medicine, nursing, and physiotherapy (n = 24) participated in a pilot infection control simulation. participants completed a survey regarding confidence performing infection control skills, perceptions of interprofessional communication and collaboration, and satisfaction with the module. qualitative feedback was obtained from facilitators and participants. results: participants reported confidence with all skills except enhanced precautions and found the interprofessional simulation-based training valuable. observers identified instances where infection control practices were not appropriately followed within the clinical context but noted strong teamwork and collaboration amongst team members. several barriers to learning were identified. the majority of participants indicated that the interprofessional infection control module should be mandatory for health sciences students. qualitative analysis revealed recommendations on ways to make this type of session more effective. conclusions: this pilot project demonstrated the feasibility of using high-fidelity patient simulation to reinforce infection control skills and promote interprofessional communication and teamwork. study results support the need for senior health professional students to learn and practice infection control skills in an interprofessional manner and to incorporate complex clinical scenarios in the training.

senior_health	the donald w. reynolds institute on aging at the university of arkansas for medical sciences in little rock is addressing one of the most pressing policy issues facing the united states: how to care for the burgeoning number of older adults. in 2001, the institute created the arkansas aging initiative, which established seven satellite centers on aging across the state using $1.3 to $2 million dollars annually from the state 's portion of the master tobacco settlement. these centers on aging assist the state 's population of older adults, many of whom reside in rural areas, live in poverty, and suffer from pc.or health. the centers provide multiple avenues of education for the community, health care providers, families, and caregivers. the arkansas aging initiative, in partnership with local hospitals, also makes geriatric primary and specialty care more accessible through senior health clinics established across rural arkansas. in 2005, older adults made more than 36,000 visits to these clinics. all sites have attracted at least one physician who holds a certificate of added qualifications in geriatrics and one advanced practice nurse. other team members include geriatric medical social workers, pharmacists, nutritionists, and neuropsychologists. this initiative also addresses other policy issues, including engaging communities in building partnerships and programs crucial to maximizing their limited resources and identifying opportunities to change reimbursement mechanisms for care provided to the growing number of older adults. we believe this type of program has the potential to create a novel paradigm for nationwide implementation.
senior_health	objectives: to assess american newspaper coverage regarding racial and ethnic minority health disparities (mhds). methods: lexisnexis((r)) was queried with specific word combinations to elicit all mhd articles printed in 257 newspapers from 2000-2004. the full texts were read and articles categorized by racial/ethnic group and specific mhd topics mentioned. results: in the five years from 2000-2004, 1,188 mhd articles were published, representing 0.09% of all articles about health. newspapers gave much attention to mhd when discussed in conferences and meetings and speeches by senior health officials and politicians. cancer, cardiovascular disease and hiv/aids were most frequent among disease-specific mentions. articles about african americans comprised 60.4% of all race/ethnicity-mentioning articles. conclusions: despite the release of major organizational reports and the publication of many studies confirming the prevalence of mhd, few newspaper articles have been published explaining mhd to the public. because of the general public 's low rate of health literacy, the health world should collaborate with the media to present a consistent, simple message concerning gaps in care experienced by all racial/ethnic minority groups. in a time of consumer-directed healthcare, if americans understand that mhds exist, they may galvanize to advocate for disparity elimination and quality improvement.
senior_health	background: polypharmacy is an important concern for patient safety and has been associated with increased adverse drug reactions, hospitalization and mortality in the elderly. objective: in light of the above, the present study aimed to assess the major characteristics associated with polypharmacy (>= 4 drugs) in a larger population of apparently healthy older subjects over 60 years. study-design: cross-sectional study. setting: the preventive medical center (cmp) in nancy. participants: 2,545 volunteers (1,175 women, 1,370 men) aged 60 years and older (66 +/- 4.8 years) were included from the senior health examination study. measurements: all subjects underwent clinical, biological examinations. sociodemographic data, practice of regular physical activity and drug intake data were collected. a self-administered questionnaire of health status, psychological status and questions regarding falls were collected. results: the prevalence of polypharmacy in this study was 29.9%. the number of drugs in polymedicated people was 5.67 +/- 1.82 versus 1.32 +/- 1.11 in non polymedicated people; p <= 0.01. multivariate analyses identified 6 independent variables associated with polypharmacy: age over 65 years (or = 1.58 95% ci: [1.05 - 2.38]; p = 0.03), poor self-perceived health status (2.79 [1.80 - 4.31]; p <= 0,01), history of falls (1.66 [1.02 - 2.71]; p = 0.04), lack of a physical activity (1.50 [1.001 - 2.26]; p = 0.049), metabolic syndrome (3.17 [1.95 - 5.15]; p <= 0,01), low or medium education level (2.20 [1.24 - 4.30]; p = 0.02). conclusion: among community-dwelling people aged 60 years and over, in addition to the presence of several diseases and advanced age, the psychological and socio-educative factors may influence drug intake and polypharmacy in the elderly. physicians should be take into account these considerations before issuing any prescriptions and review all medications used at every visit to avoid unnecessary addictions or dangerous drug-drug interactions.
senior_health	objective: to determine (1) the extent of agreement between the cage (acronym for cut down, annoyed by criticism, guilty about drinking, eye-opener drinks) and the short michigan alcoholism screening test-geriatric version (smast-g) in identifying older persons who may have possible alcohol use disorders (auds) and (2) whether persons identified as having possible auds by each of these screening measures differ in their drinking, demographic, or health-related characteristics. design: secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study using data from a self-administered mailed survey sample. setting: three organizations were surveyed: (1) members of the american association of retired persons and, in southern california, (2) managed care enrollees in a large medical group and (3) attendees of a community-based senior health center. participants: one thousand eight hundred eighty-nine persons aged 55 and older completing a health risk appraisal for older persons (health risk appraisal for the elderly (hra-e)). measurements: the hra-e included items on drinking behaviors (including amount of alcohol use, the cage, and the smast-g) and health and demographic characteristics. results: twenty-six percent of all persons screened positive on the cage or the smast-g. fewer than half of all persons screening positive on either the cage or the smast-g, screened positive on both measures. among cur-rent drinkers, persons screening positive on the smast-g alone drank less than person,, screening positive on the cage alone, and these persons drank less than those screening positive on both the smast-g and the cage. more men screened positive oil the cage alone than on the smast-g alone. conclusion: fewer than half of persons screening positive on either the cage or the smast-g screened positive on both measures, suggesting that these instruments may be capturing different aspects of unsafe drinking. a screening strategy employing both brief measures may identify more auds among older persons having differing demographic and health characteristics.
senior_health	background: in japan, the bivalent hpv vaccine was approved in october, 2009 and became available as a non-routine vaccine from december, 2009. while routine vaccinations are free, the cost and responsibility for non-routine vaccinations are left to the individual. in exceptional circumstances regional governments fund non-routine vaccinations. this was the case in shiki city, saitama prefecture, where a high uptake rate for individual (non-school based) hpv vaccination was obtained. materials: on january 20, 2010, the mayor of shiki city announced to the media his decision to vaccinate adolescent girls in shiki city against hpv. a project team for hpv vaccination was set up in the city 's health promotion center. to gain mutual consent for hpv vaccination, senior health professionals, city officials, the head of the board of education, school principals and health-care teachers met several times. the cohort to be vaccinated was 1254 girls aged 12-15 years. individual notifications were mailed to each girl on april 23, 2010, along with information about the hpv vaccine. conclusions: as of april 10th, 2011, the uptake rate for girls aged 15 years old was 90.7% for the 1st dose. the vaccine registry is managed by the health care system of the city. the success of the hpv vaccination program and high uptake rates in shiki city is a good model for the nationwide hpv vaccination program that started in february, 2011.

multiple_sclerosis	background: multiple sclerosis (ms) is the most prevalent autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (cns) in young adults. more than 50 genomic regions have been associated with ms susceptibility. due the important immune-modulating properties of vitamin d, vitamin d receptor (vdr) gene polymorphisms - which interfere with the actions of vitamin d-could be related to increased risk of ms. methods: we studied 120 patients fulfilling the mcdonald criteria for ms (81 females and 39 males) and 180 healthy unrelated controls, nested in a case-control study, and were recruited from the national institute of neurology and neurosurgery, manuel velasco suarez in mexico city. genotyping of vdr gene polymorphisms bsmi (rs1544410) and taqi (rs731236) was performed using taqman snp genotyping assay which consists of a predesigned mix of unlabeled polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers and the taqman minor groove binding group (mgb) probe (fam dye-labeled). results: there was a statistically significant, positive association between ms and the t/t genotype of bsml polymorphism (or = 4.15; 95%ci 1.83-9.39), showing also a significant positive trend across genotypes (p < 0.01). this association was also present evaluating the recessive inheritance model of the polymorphism (or = 3.91; 95%ci 1.77-8.64). when evaluating the association by alleles, the statistically significant positive association seen by genotypes was confirmed in the t allele carriers, showing an or of 1.83 (95%ci 127-2.65) for ms. conclusions: we found a positive association of the genetic vdr polymorphisms taql (rs731236) and bsml (rs1544410), with the risk of ms in a sample of mexican adults.

multiple_sclerosis	nocardia is a gram-positive aerobic pathogen that usually affects immunocompromised patients. we report a case of pulmonary infection caused by a rare nocardia species, nocardia beijingensis, in a 50-year-old woman who had received alemtuzumab for the treatment of her multiple sclerosis. the invasive pulmonary infection was successfully treated with meropenem.
multiple_sclerosis	the eif2 alpha protein plays a critical role in the regulation of translation. the production of double-stranded rna (dsrna) during viral replication can activate protein kinase r (pkr), which phosphorylates eif2 alpha, leading to inhibition of the initial step of translation. many viruses have evolved gene products targeting the pkr-eif2 alpha pathway, indicating its importance in antiviral defense. in the present study, we focused on alternations of pkr-eif2a pathway during human herpesvirus 6a (hhv-6a) infection while monitoring viral gene expression and infectious viral yields. we have found increased phosphorylated pkr as well as phosphorylated eif2 alpha coincident with accumulation of the late gp82-105 viral protein. the level of total pkr was relatively constant, but it decreased by 144 h postinfection. the phosphorylation of eif2a led to a moderate increase in activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) accumulation, indicating moderate inhibition of protein translation during hhv-6a infection. the overexpression of pkr led to decreased viral propagation coincident with increased accumulation of phosphorylated pkr and phosphorylated eif2a. moreover, addition of a dominant negative pkr mutant resulted in a moderate increase in viral replication. hhv-6a exhibits relatively low efficiency of propagation of progeny virus secreted into the culture medium. this study suggests that the replicative strategy of hhv-6a involves a mild infection over a lengthy life cycle in culture, while preventing severe activation of the pkr-eif2 alpha pathway. importance human herpesvirus 6a (hhv-6a) and hhv-6b are common, widely prevalent viruses, causing from mild to severe disease. our study focused on the pkr-eif2 alpha stress pathway, which limits viral replication. the hhv-6 genome carries multiple genes transcribed from the two strands, predicting accumulation of dsrnas which can activate pkr and inhibition of protein synthesis. we report that hhv-6a induced the accumulation of phosphorylated pkr and phosphorylated eif2 alpha and a moderate increase of activating transcription factor 4 (atf4), which is known to transcribe stress genes. overexpression of pkr led to increased eif2 alpha phosphorylation and decreased viral replication, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative pkr mutant resulted in a moderate increase in viral replication. these results suggest that the hhv-6a replication strategy involves restricted activation of the pkr-eif2 alpha pathway, partial translation inhibition, and lower yields of infectious virus. in essence, hhv-6a limits its own replication due to the inability to bypass the eif2 alpha phosphorylation.
multiple_sclerosis	aims: heme derived from hemolysis is pro-oxidative and proinflammatory and promotes vaso-occlusion in murine models of sickle cell disease (scd), suggesting that enhanced detoxification of heme may be beneficial. nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (nrf2) transcription pathway is the principal cellular defense system responding to pro-oxidative and proinflammatory stress. dimethyl fumarate (dmf), a drug approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis, provides neuroprotection by activating nrf2-responsive genes. we hypothesized that induction of nrf2 with dmf would be beneficial in murine scd models. results: dmf (30mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.08% methyl cellulose) was administered for 3-7 days to ny1dd and hbss-townes scd mice. vaso-occlusion, a hallmark of scd, measured in sickle mice with dorsal skinfold chambers, was inhibited by dmf. the inhibitory effect of dmf was abrogated by the heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) inhibitor tin protoporphyrin. dmf increased nuclear nrf2 and cellularmrnaofnrf2-responsive genes in livers and kidneys. dmf increased heme defenses, including ho-1, haptoglobin, hemopexin, and ferritin heavy chain, although plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were unchanged. dmf decreased markers of inflammation, including nuclear factor-kappa b phospho-p65, adhesion molecules, and toll-like receptor 4. dmf administered for 24 weeks to hbss-townesmice decreased hepatic necrosis, inflammatory cytokines, and irregularly shaped erythrocytes and increased hemoglobin f, but did not alter hematocrits, reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase, plasma heme, or spleen weights, indicating that the beneficial effects of dmf were not attributable to decreased hemolysis. innovation: these studies identify nrf2 activation as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of scd. conclusion: dmf activates nrf2, enhances antioxidant defenses, and inhibits inflammation and vaso-occlusion in scd mice.
multiple_sclerosis	decreased information processing speed (ips) is frequently reported in pediatric multiple sclerosis (ms) patients. the computerized version of the symbol digit modalities test (c-sdmt) measures ips over eight consecutive trials per session and additionally captures changes in performance within the session. here, we establish normative c-sdmt performance and test-retest reliability in healthy children (hc) and explore differences in the overall c-sdmt-performance between hc and ms patients. this cross-sectional study included 478 hc (237 female, 49.5%) divided into five age groups (2 years each), and 27 ms patients (22 female, 81.5%) aged 8-18 years. the average time to complete the c-sdmt increased with age (|r| 0.70, 95% ci -0.74, -0.64). test-retest reliability was high (icc = 0.91) in hc. the total time to complete the c-sdmt did not differ between children with ms and sex- and age- matched hc (p = 0.23). however, ms patients were less likely to show faster performance across all the successive eight trials compared to hc (p = 0.0001). healthy children demonstrate faster ips with increasing age, as well as during successive trials of the c-sdmt. the inability of pediatric ms patients to maintain the increase in processing speed over successive trials suggests a reduced capacity for procedural learning, possibly resulting from cognitive fatigue.
multiple_sclerosis	we investigated the effect of the functional insertion/deletion (i/d) polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) gene on the response to interferon- (ifn-) therapy in croatian and slovenian patients with multiple sclerosis (ms). a total of 275 ifn- treated ms patients [162 responders (rs) and 113 nonresponders (nrs)] were genotyped by pcr. the ace i/d genotype distribution and allele frequencies did not differ between female rs and nrs. however, male nrs tended to have a greater prevalence of the dd genotype (p=0.073; odds ratio: 2.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.91-7.60) and a significantly higher frequency of the d allele (p=0.022; odds ratio: 2.43; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-5.20) than male rs. multiple forward stepwise regression analysis indicated that the negative response to ifn- therapy was associated with the ace-dd genotype in men (=0.371; multiple r-2 change: 0.132; p=0.009) and a higher pretreatment relapse rate in both men (=-0.438; multiple r-2 change: 0.135; p=0.015) and women (=-0.208; multiple r-2 change: 0.042; p=0.034). the ace i/d polymorphism and pretreatment relapse rate accounted for approximate to 26.7% of the ifn- response variability among the men in the sample. further studies of a larger number of ms patients from different populations are necessary to evaluate these preliminary findings.
multiple_sclerosis	laquinimod is currently being tested as a therapeutic drug in multiple sclerosis. however, its exact mechanism of action is still under investigation. tracking of fluorescently-tagged encephalitogenic t cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, revealed that laquinimod significantly reduces the invasion of pathogenic effector t cells into the cns tissue. t-cell activation, differentiation and amplification within secondary lymphoid organs after immunization with myelin antigen, their migratory capacity and re-activation within the nervous tissue were either only mildly affected or remained unchanged. instead, laquinimod directly impacted the functionality of the cns vasculature. the expression of tight junction proteins p120 and zo-1 in human brain endothelial cells was up-regulated upon laquinimod treatment, resulting in a significant increase in the transendothelial electrical resistance of confluent monolayers of brain endothelial cells. similarly, expression of the adhesion molecule activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (alcam) and inflammatory chemokines ccl2 and ip-10 was suppressed, leading to a significant reduction in the migration of memory t(h)1 and t(h)17 lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (bbb). our data indicate that laquinimod exerts its therapeutic effects by tightening the bbb and limiting parenchymal invasion of effector t cells, thereby reducing cns damage.

multiple_sclerosis	clinical trial design in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) remains hampered by a lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. the present study evaluated peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (dti) as a surrogate marker of axonal degeneration in als. longitudinal studies were undertaken in 21 als patients studied at 0 and 3 months, and 19 patients at 0, 3 and 6 months, with results compared to 13 age-matched controls. imaging metrics were correlated across a range of functional assessments including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale revised (alsfrs-r), lower limb muscle strength (medical research council sum score, mrcss-ll), compound muscle action potential amplitudes and motor unit number estimation (mune). fractional anisotropy was reduced at baseline in als patients in the tibial (p < 0.05), and peroneal nerve (p < 0.05). fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity declined in the tibial nerve between baselines, 3- and 6-month scans (p < 0.01). from a functional perspective, alsfrs-r correlated with fractional anisotropy values from tibial (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) and peroneal nerves (r = 0.52, p = 0.001). similarly, peroneal nerve mune values correlated with fractional anisotropy values from the tibial (r = 0.48, p = 0.002) and peroneal nerve (r = 0.39, p = 0.01). there were correlations between the change in alsfrs-r and tibial nerve axial diffusivity (r = 0.38, p = 0.02) and the change in mrcss-ll and peroneal nerve fractional anisotropy (r = 0.44, p = 0.009). in conclusion, this study has demonstrated that some peripheral nerve dti metrics are sensitive to axonal degeneration in als. further, that dti metrics correlated with measures of functional disability, strength and neurophysiological measures of lower motor neuron loss.
multiple_sclerosis	background. persons with multiple sclerosis (pwms) are often characterized by increased motor fatigability, which is a performance change on an objectively measured criterion after any type of voluntary muscle contractions. this review summarizes the existing literature to determine which protocols and outcome measures are best to detect or study motor fatigability and the underlying mechanisms in ms. methods. two electronic databases, pubmed and web of science, were searched for relevant articles published until august 2016 with a combination of multiple sclerosis, fatigability, muscle fatigue, and motor fatigue. results. a total of 48 articles were retained for data extraction. a variety of fatigability protocols were reported; protocols showed differences in type (isometric vs concentric), duration (15 to 180 s), and number of contractions (fixed or until exhaustion). also, 12 articles reported motor fatigability during functional movements, predominantly assessed by changes in walking speed; 11 studies evaluated the mechanisms underlying motor fatigability, using additional electrical nerve or transcranial magnetic stimulation. three articles reported psychometrics of the outcomes. conclusions. the disparity of protocols and outcome measures to study different aspects of motor fatigability in pwms impedes direct comparison between data. most protocols use maximal single-joint isometric contractions, with the advantage of high standardization. because there is no head-to-head comparison of the different protocols and only limited information on psychometric properties of outcomes, there is currently no gold standard to assess motor fatigability. the disability level, disease phenotype, and studied limb may influence the assessment of motor fatigability in pwms.
multiple_sclerosis	the present paper aims at providing an objective narrative review of the existing non-pharmacological treatments for spasticity. whereas pharmacologic and conventional physiotherapy approaches result well effective in managing spasticity due to stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy and incomplete spinal cord injury, the real usefulness of the non-pharmacological ones is still debated. we performed a narrative literature review of the contribution of non-pharmacological treatments to spasticity management, focusing on the role of non-invasive neurostimulation protocols (ninm). spasticity therapeutic options available to the physicians include various pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches (including ninm and vibration therapy), aimed at achieving functional goals for patients and their caregivers. a successful treatment of spasticity depends on a clear comprehension of the underlying pathophysiology, the natural history, and the impact on patient 's performances. even though further studies aimed at validating non-pharmacological treatments for spasticity should be fostered, there is growing evidence supporting the usefulness of non-pharmacologic approaches in significantly helping conventional treatments (physiotherapy and drugs) to reduce spasticity and improving patient 's quality of life. hence, non-pharmacological treatments should be considered as a crucial part of an effective management of spasticity.

hepatitis_c	at a population level, little is known regarding the risk of liver- and nonliver-related mortality and hospitalization and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) in hepatitis c virus (hcv)-infected patients with decompensated cirrhosis (dc). this large-scale national record-linkage study estimates these outcomes following first hospital admission for dc. record-linkages between national hcv diagnosis and clinical databases and the national inpatient hospital episode database and mortality register were conducted to follow-up the disease course of all identified hcv-diagnosed and chronically infected persons. the study population consisted of 1169 hcv chronically infected persons who had a first hospital admission for dc within the period 1994-2013. we observed an overall average annual percentage change of 12.6% in new dc patients (from 63 in 1994-1999 to 541 in 2009-2013), with no evidence for any improvement in the relative risks of liver-related or all-cause death over time. between 1 january 1994 and 31 may 2014, 722 and 95 dc patients had died of a liver- and a nonliver-related cause, respectively, and 106 patients had a subsequent first admission for hcc. the 5-year cumulative incidence of liver-related mortality, nonliver-related mortality and first subsequent hcc admission was 61.3%, 8.2% and 8.8%, respectively. the health burden in hcv-infected patients associated with development of decompensated cirrhosis has increased dramatically over the last 20years. our findings establish the baseline mortality and hcc progression rates in dc patients against which the impact of new antiviral therapies can be measured.
hepatitis_c	background: childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) with current cure rates reaching 80% emphasizes the necessity to determine treatment-related long-term effects. the aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hepatic late adverse effects in a cohort of all survivors treated at the hematology and oncology unit, pediatrics department, menoufia university, egypt. methods: in this case-control study, height, weight, and body mass index (bmi) were assessed for 35 pediatric all survivors and 35 healthy children. these parameters were plotted on the growth and who standard deviation charts for both males and females. overweight and obesity were defined by bmi >85th and 95th percentile respectively. laboratory investigations were done in the form of iron profile, liver enzymes, total and direct bilirubin levels, serum urea & creatinine and detection of hepatitis c virus antibodies by elisa. results: the weight and bmi were significantly greater in the survivors than controls (p value = 0.002 and 0.039 respectively). alt, total & direct bilirubin, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were considerably higher in the survivors than the controls (p value = 0.03, 0.036, 0.044, 0.006 and 0.03 respectively). ten (28.6%) of survivors had hepatitis c antibodies with none (0%) of controls (p value = 0.02) conclusions: pediatric all survivors are at increased risk of overweight/ obesity, hepatic dysfunction in the form of elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and c viral hepatitis. screening of those survivors for such complications should be considered.
hepatitis_c	background & aims: neonates born to hepatitis c virus (hcv)-positive mothers are usually not screened for hcv. unscreened children may act as active sources for social hcv transmission, and factors contributing for vertical hcv transmitting still remained controversial and needed optimization. we aimed to investigate the factors contributing for vertical hcv transmission in egypt; the highest hcv prevalence worldwide. methods: we prospectively followed the neonates born to hcv-positive mother in the child-bearing period, to identify mother-to-child transmission (mtct) factors from january 2015 to march 2016. data mining computational analysis was used to quantify the findings. results: among 3000 randomized pregnant women, prevalence of hcv was 46/3000 (1.53%). hcv vertical transmission was identified in eight neonates (17.39%). only high viral load identified at 975.000 iu was the predictor risk for mtct. conclusions: hepatitis c virus in pregnancy has substantial risk for vertical hcv transmission: high viral load in hcv-positive women increases the risk of hcv transmission to neonates. screening pregnant women during early stage of pregnancy and optimizing the hcv viral load in hcv-positive women might prevent vertical hcv transmission to neonates.
hepatitis_c	background & aims: acute rejection is detrimental to most transplanted solid organs, but is considered to be less of a consequence for transplanted livers. we evaluated risk factors for and outcomes after biopsyproven acute rejection (bpar) based on an analysis of a more recent national sample of recipients of liver transplants from living and deceased donors. methods: we analyzed data from the adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation cohort study (a2all) from 2003 through 2014 as the exploratory cohort and the scientific registry of transplant recipients (srtr) from 2005 through 2013 as the validation cohort. we examined factors associated with time to first bpar using multivariable cox regression or discrete-survival analysis. competing risks methods were used to compare causes of death and graft failure between recipients of living and deceased donors. results: at least 1 bpar episode occurred in 239 of 890 recipients in a2all (26.9%) and 7066 of 45,423 recipients in srtr (15.6%). in each database, risk of rejection was significantly lower when livers came from biologically related living donors (a2all hazard ratio [hr], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.43-0.76; and srtr hr, 0.78; 95% ci, 0.66-0.91) and higher in liver transplant recipients with primary biliary cirrhosis, of younger age, or with hepatitis c. in each database, bpar was associated with significantly higher risks of graft failure and death. the risks were highest in the 12 month post-bpar period in patients whose first episode occurred more than 1 year after liver transplantation: hrs for graft failure were 6.79 in a2all (95% ci, 2.64-17.45) and 4.41 in srtr (95% ci, 3.71-5.23); hrs for death were 8.81 in a2all (95% ci, 3.37-23.04) and 3.94 in srtr (95% ci, 3.22-4.83). in analyses of cause-specific mortality, associations were observed for liver-related (graft failure) causes of death but not for other causes. conclusions: contrary to previous data, acute rejection after liver transplant is associated with significantly increased risk of graft failure, all-cause mortality, and graft failure-related death, regardless of primary liver disease etiology. living donor liver transplantation from a biologically related donor is associated with decreased risk of rejection.
hepatitis_c	we studied the relation between the polymorphism of p-glycoprotein (p-gp) and of breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp), encoded by abcb1 and abcg2 genes, respectively, and the pharmacokinetic variability and clinical response during the treatment with sorafenib of hepatocellular carcinoma. at the paul brousse hospital in villejuif, france, 47 consecutive patients with advanced hcc treated with a single agent sorafenib, were enrolled. sorafenib exposure was measured by its plasma concentration 3 h after oral administration of 400 mg (bid) by liquid chromatography. all enrolled patients were genotyped for abcb1 (rs2032582; rs1045642) and abcg2 (rs2231137; rs2231142; rs2622604) by blood genomic dna extraction and mass array genotyping. the clinical response was evaluated after 3months of treatment according to the recist criteria. significant associations between sorafenib exposure and the studied polymorphisms were observed for abcb1 3435c >t, abcg2 34g >a, abcg2 1143c >t and abcg2 421c >a, but not for abcb1 2677g >ta snp. in heterozygous patients for abcb1 3435 c >t, abcg2 34 g >a and abcg2 1143 c >t polymorphisms were significantly associated with the lowest sorafenib plasma levels. those patients presented a tendency to have the best clinical evolution. heterozygous forms of the studied polymorphisms could be associated with a better therapeutic response.
hepatitis_c	objective: to estimate the incidence of hepatitis c virus (hcv) seroconversion and the risk of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis in hcv seroconverters among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. methods: we analysed data on 4059 persons with hiv enrolled in a cohort study in italy. results: incidence rate of seroconversion was 0.6/100 person-years overall, and drug users and menwho-have-sex-with-men were at highest risk. the cumulative risk of progression to severe fibrosis/cirrhosis was 30% by 10 years after seroconversion. conclusions: new hcv infections have a rapidly progressive course in this population. persons with hiv and hcv superinfection should be prioritized for treatment with anti-hcv direct-acting antivirals.

hepatitis_c	backgroundmany patients with cirrhosis follow complex medication and dietary regimens, and those with decompensated cirrhosis suffer debilitating complications. these factors impact activities of daily living and quality of life. aimsto explore the concerns and challenges of people with cirrhosis and their use of support services and to also describe health professionals' (hp) perspectives of patients' concerns. methodsthis is a cross-sectional study at a tertiary liver clinic involving 50 patients and 54 hp. data were collected using structured questionnaires. the study includes patients' report of their challenges/problems now that they have cirrhosis (patient-volunteered concerns') and hp' report of patients' concerns. both also ranked a list of 10 potential concerns. resultspatients were, on average, 58years old (sd=10.2), mostly male (78%), caucasian (86%) and with compensated cirrhosis (60%). the patients' most common volunteered concerns related to managing symptoms, emotional issues and disease. most ranked developing liver cancer' (79%), losing ability to do daily tasks for yourself' (76%), fear of dying' (64%) and fear of the unknown' (64%) as priority concerns. regarding the use of support services, 24% of patients had accessed a dietician, 20% a pharmacist and 18% a psychologist. from the hp' perspective, the patients' most significant challenges related to managing disease (65%) and symptoms (48%), access to healthcare (56%) and information/knowledge (48%). conclusionsour findings demonstrate that cirrhosis (its symptoms, complications and treatment) is associated with significant concerns for patients. the discrepancies between the views of hp and patients suggest that we may not be measuring or addressing patients' needs appropriately.
hepatitis_c	introduction: transfusion transmissible infections (ttis) such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis b virus (hbv), hepatitis c virus (hcv) and syphilis pose a threat to blood safety in a developing country like india. aim: to determine the prevalence of ttis among healthy donors in andaman and nicobar islands, india, and to further help in determination of the population subset to be focused on for enhancing blood donor pool. materials and methods: this retrospective cross- sectional study was conducted on all voluntary and replacement donors in a tertiary health care centre in andaman and nicobar islands for a period of three years. donor blood was screened for hiv, hbv, hcv, syphilis and malarial parasite using rapid kits and elisa. results: out of 12,118 donors, 97.01% were males and 2.99% were females. 9409 (77.64 %) were voluntary donors and 2709 (22.35 %) were replacement donors. majority of the screened donors belonged to 25 to 40 age group. out of 12,118 donors, 265 (2.18 %) were seropositive. among them, 8 (0.066%) were hiv positive, 15 (0.124%) hcv positive, 128 (1.056%) hbsag positive, 30 (0.247%) syphilis positive and 84 (0.693%) were positive for malarial antigen. yearly prevalence of seropositivity was 2.370%, 2.113% and 2.082% for three consecutive years. conclusion: with high prevalence of ttis among healthy donors, safe blood transfusion is still a challenge in developing countries. this continues to place unacceptable burden on health sector. there is a need for encouragement of voluntary blood donation, strict donor selection criteria and sensitive screening tests to minimize ttis in indian setting.
hepatitis_c	the hepatitis c virus (hcv) infects hepatocytes after binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in particular syndecan-1, followed by recognition of the tetraspanin cd81 and other receptors. heparan sulfate proteoglycans are found in a specific microenvironment coating the hepatocyte surface called the glycocalyx and are receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, growth factors, lipoproteins, and infectious agents. we investigated the mutual influence of hcv infection on the glycocalyx and revealed new links between syndecan-1 and cd81. hepatocyte infection by hcv was inhibited after knocking down syndecan-1 or xylosyltransferase 2, a key enzyme of syndecan-1 biosynthesis. simultaneous knockdown of syndecan-1 and cd81 strongly inhibited infection, suggesting their cooperative action. at early infection stages, syndecan-1 and virions colocalized at the plasma membrane and were internalized in endosomes. direct interactions between syndecan-1 and cd81 were revealed in primary and transformed hepatocytes by immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. expression of syndecan-1 and xylosyltransferase 2 was altered within days post-infection, and the remaining syndecan-1 pool colocalized poorly with cd81. the data indicate a profound reshuffling of the hepatocyte glycocalyx during hcv infection, possibly required for establishing optimal conditions of viral propagation.
hepatitis_c	background nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) is known to recur following liver transplantation (lt). metabolic risk factors increase with immunosuppression. however, the rate of fibrosis progression following lt for nash while on immunosuppression is less clear. aim the incidences of steatosis, nash, and fibrosis following lt for nash were quantified and compared with those transplanted for alcoholic liver disease (ald). patients and methods records of all nash patients and 1:2 match with ald transplant recipients between 2001 and 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. patients without liver biopsies beyond 2 months following lt were excluded. results nash patients (n = 77) were older (p = 0.0006) and less likely male (p < 0.001) than ald patients (n = 108). the incidence of steatosis, nash, and fibrosis stage increased at 1, 3, and 5 years in both groups. although steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores were higher, fibrosis was lower in nash compared with ald (0.43 vs. 1.0 stage/year; p = 0.0045). the incremental increase in the rate of fibrosis was faster in the first year compared with 4-5 years (0.8 vs. 0.04 stage/year) following lt. the rate of fibrosis progression during 4-5 years was decreased in nash compared with ald recipients (0.04 vs. 0.33 stage/year; p = 0.015). nash etiology was associated with reduced rate of fibrosis progression (odds ratio = 0.67) on multivariate analysis. conclusion despite having more steatosis and inflammation, progression of fibrosis was slower in nash compared with ald recipients. fibrosis progression slows with time following lt on immunosuppression and approximates the pretransplant progression rate by year 5. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
weight_loss	this study aims to investigate weight regain and the associated variables 10 years after roux-en-y gastric bypass. this retrospective study recruited patients submitted to roux-en-y gastric bypass (n = 166) for a 10-year follow-up. the following variables were investigated: body mass index (bmi), percentage of excess weight loss (%ewl), weight regain (wr), and percentage of weight regain (%wg). the chi-squared test or fisher 's exact test compared proportions, and the mann-whitney test compared numerical measurements between the groups. analysis of variance (anova) compared the measurements over time. the significance level was set at 5 %. the sample had a mean age of 39.59 +/- 11.69 years, and females prevailed (71.7 %). in the long-term follow-up, 41 % of the patients had weight regain. seventy-two months after surgery, excess weight, preoperative bmi, gender, age, nutritional monitoring, and iron deficiency did not explain weight regain. younger patients had regained significantly more weight 96 (p = 0.008) and 120 months (p = 0.004) after surgery than older patients. patients who regained weight had ferritin < 15 mu g/dl 96 months after surgery (p = 0.019). patients submitted to roux-en-y gastric bypass presented weight regain, which increased over time. age, iron deficiency, and time since surgery were associated with weight regain in the long-term follow-up.
weight_loss	aims: to characterize gastrointestinal adverse events (aes) with different glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (glp-1ras). methods: two retrospective intention-to-treat analyses of 6-month patient-level data were conducted. data from three studies comparing exenatide once weekly (n = 617) with exenatide twice daily (n = 606) were pooled, and one (duration-6) comparing exenatide once weekly (n = 461) with liraglutide (n = 450) was analysed separately. patient-reported gastrointestinal aes were classified as upper or lower, ae incidences and timing were determined, subgroups were analysed, and associations of gastrointestinal aes with efficacy were examined. results: nausea was the most common gastrointestinal ae for all treatments. fewer exenatide once-weekly-treated vs exenatide twice-daily-or liraglutide-treated patients reported gastrointestinal aes (34% vs 45% and 25% vs 41%, respectively; both p <.0001). fewer exenatide once-weekly-treated patients reported upper plus lower events than liraglutide-treated patients (p <.001); the difference between exenatide once weekly and twice daily was not significant. within each group, more women than men reported gastrointestinal aes. events occurrred early and were predominantly mild. glycated haemoglobin reductions were similar for patients with or without gastrointestinal aes. weight loss was greater for patients with gastrointestinal aes with exenatide once weekly and exenatide twice daily (p <.05); no difference was observed in duration-6. conclusions: gastrointestinal aes were less frequent with exenatide once weekly vs exenatide twice daily or liraglutide, and combined upper and lower events occurred less often. gastrointestinal aes were typically mild and occurred early. gastrointestinal aes did not affect glycaemic control but may be associated with greater weight loss.
weight_loss	introduction: the cardiovascular risk marker tissue plasminogen activator antigen (t-pa:ag) can be reduced by long-term exercise interventions, but it is unknown, whether this is due to the weight loss induced by physical activity or due to the physical activity per se. materials and methods: this was tested in 60 healthy, younger (20-40 years), overweight (bmi: 25-30 kg/m(2)) men randomly assigned to 12 weeks of intervention in one of four groups: training (t); energy-reduced diet (d); training and increased diet (t-id); sedentary lifestyle and unchanged diet (controls, c). fasting blood samples were obtained before and after 12 weeks of intervention and analyzed for plasma t-pa:ag. results: body weight was reduced in groups t and d. we observed a decrease in t-pa:ag from baseline to 12 weeks in all three exercise and diet intervention groups, and no change in the control group. a between-group difference in t-pa: ag was observed at 12 weeks (p = 0.001), and this was due to lower values in t (p= 0.0005), d (p= 0.005) and t-id (p= 0.009) compared with the control group. total body fat mass was reduced in all three exercise groups, and we observed a positive correlation between changes in t-pa:ag and changes in intra-abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissue volume. conclusions: our results demonstrate that t-pa:ag was reduced in all three intervention groups. this suggests that 12 weeks of endurance training per se, irrespective of concomitant weight loss, beneficially affects cardiovascular risk in healthy, younger, overweight men.

weight_loss	global prevalence of obesity has been increasing dramatically in all ages. although traditional causes for obesity development have been studied widely, it is unclear whether environmental exposure of substances such as trace heavy metals affects obesity development among children and adolescents so far. data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (1999-2011)were retrieved, and 6602 us children were analyzed in this study. urinary level of nine trace heavy metals, including barium, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony, thallium, and tungsten, was analyzed for their association with the prevalence of obesity among children aged 6-19 years. multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the associations adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, gender, urinary creatinine, pir, serum cotinine, and television, video game, and computer usage. a remarkable association was found between barium exposure (or 1.43; 95% ci 1.09-1.88; p < 0.001) and obesity in children aged 6-19 years. negative association was observed between cadmium (or 0.46; 95% ci 0.33-0.64; p < 0.001), cobalt (or 0.56; 95% ci: 0.41-0.76; p < 0.001), and lead (or 0.57; 95% ci 0.41-0.78; p = 0.018), and obesity. all the negative associations were stronger in the 6-12 years group than in the 13-19 years group. the present study demonstrated that barium might increase the occurrence of obesity, but cadmium, cobalt, and lead caused weight loss among children. the results imply that trace heavy metals may represent critical risk factors for the development of obesity, especially in the area that the state of metal contamination is serious.
weight_loss	feline hepatic lipidosis (fhl) is a common and potentially fatal liver disorder. although the pathophysiologic mechanisms of fhl remain elusive, there is an imbalance between the influx of fatty acids from peripheral fat stores into the liver, de novo liposynthesis, and the rate of hepatic oxidation and dispersal of hepatic tag via excretion of very-low density lipoproteins. the diagnosis of fhl is based on anamnestic, clinical, and clinicopathologic findings, associated with diagnostic imaging of the liver, and cytology, or histological examination of liver biopsies. fluid therapy, electrolyte correction and adequate early nutrition are essential components of the therapy for fhl.
weight_loss	background & aims: patients with double temporary enterostomy may suffer from intestinal failure (if). parenteral nutrition (pn) is the gold standard treatment until surgical reestablishment of intestinal continuity. chyme reinfusion (cr) is a technique consisting in an extracorporeal circulation of the chyme. the aims were to determine: i) whether cr could restore intestinal absorption, decrease pn needs, improve nutritional status and plasma liver tests; ii) the feasibility of home cr. methods: from the 232 patients if consecutively referred.for cr from 2000 to 2014, the 212 patients with if, technical feasibility of cr, and effectively treated by cr, were included. were collected prospectively before and during cr: daily stomal and fecal outputs, coefficients of nitrogen (cnda) and fat (cfda) digestive absorption, weight loss, body mass index (bmi), nutritional risk index (nri), plasma albumin, citrulline, and liver tests. results: 183 patients had temporary double enterostomy and 29 exposed enterocutaneous fistulas. cr reduced the intestinal output (2444 +/- 933 vs 370 +/- 457 ml/day, p < 0.001), improved cnda (46 +/- 16 vs 80 +/- 14%, p < 0.001) and cfda (48 +/- 25 vs 86 +/- 11%, p < 0.001), and normalized plasma citrulline concentration (17.6 +/- 8.4 vs 30.3 +/- 11.8 mu mol/1, p < 0.001). pn was stopped in 126/139 (91%) patients within 2 +/- 8 d. nutritional status improved (p < 0.001): weight (+4.6 +/- 8.6%), bmi (+3.8 +/- 7.7%), plasma albumin (+6.2 +/- 6.1 g/l), and nri (+10.9 +/- 9.5). the proportion of patients with plasma liver tests abnormalities decieased (88 vs 51%, p < 0.01). home cr was feasible without any serious complications in selected patients. conclusions: cr corrected the intestinal failure by restoring intestinal absorption, allowing pn weaning in 91% of patients. cr contributes to improve nutritional status and to reduce plasma liver tests abnormalities, and is feasible at home.

weight_loss	context: malnutrition is highly prevalent in cancer patients and an important predictor of morbidity, mortality, treatment response, and toxicity. taste and smell changes (tscs) are common and may contribute to malnutrition. research has previously focused on patients receiving chemotherapy (ct) or head and neck radiotherapy (rt). however, tscs may occur pre-treatment, with other treatment modalities, and in cancer survivors. this review evaluates objective and subjective assessment of taste and smell, discusses the prevalence of tscs in cancer, and reviews the clinical sequelae of tscs in cancer patients. objectives: to critically evaluate objective and subjective assessment of tscs, and the prevalence and clinical sequelae of tscs in cancer. methods: a literature search was conducted using pubmed, cinahl and embase for english-language articles published january 2009-june 2016. search terms included combinations of the following: chemosensory, taste, smell, cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, survivors. reference lists of articles retrieved were also reviewed. results: variation in objective and subjective assessment methodologies has resulted in difficulties interpreting the literature. tsc prevalence varies depending on stage of disease and treatment regimens, from 16% to 70% and 50% to 70% during ct and rt, respectively. tscs in patients who are treatment-naive, receiving hormone or immunotherapy treatment, posttreatment and cancer survivors have not been adequately studied. tscs are associated with impaired nutritional status. the relationship between cancer-associated symptoms and nutritional status is not clearly defined. conclusion: there is no gold standard assessment tool for tscs. heterogeneity in study methods hinders conclusive identification of the most appropriate way to measure tscs. subjective measures may reflect the patient experience and more reliably predict changes in dietary behaviour. evaluation of tscs should form part of all nutritional assessments in cancer patients. the true prevalence and severity of tscs at all stages of cancer could then be established.
weight_loss	this study evaluates unbranched, saturated carboxylic esters with respect to their suitability to be used as storage media for latent heat storage applications. therefore, important thermophysical properties are gathered both by means of literature research as well as by experimental measurements. additionally esters are critically evaluated against other common phase change materials in terms of their environmental impact and their economic potential. the experimental investigations are performed for eleven selected ester samples with a focus on the determination of their melting temperature and their enthalpy of fusion using differential scanning calorimetry. transient hot bridge was used to determine the thermal conductivity of the liquid samples while thermogravimetric analysis was employed for the evaluation of the 5% weight loss temperature as well as of the decomposition temperature of the nonvolatile samples. both experimental results and literature data reveal that the highest potential of esters against other phase change materials lies in low temperature applications where the main alternative is using salt hydrates.

weight_loss	our objective was to examine the respective contributions of changes in visceral adiposity, subcutaneous adiposity, liver fat, and cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) to the improvements in cardiometabolic risk markers in response to a 3-yr healthy eating/physical activity lifestyle intervention. ninety-four out of 144 viscerally obese healthy men completed a 3-yr lifestyle intervention. body weight, body composition, and fat distribution were assessed by anthropometry and dexa/computed tomography. crf, adipokines, lipoprotein/lipid profile, and 75 g of oral glucose tolerance were assessed. crf and visceral and subcutaneous adiposity significantly improved over the 3-yr intervention, with a nadir in year 1 and a partial regain in year 3. liver fat (estimated by insulin hepatic extraction) stabilized from year 1 to year 3, whereas homa-ir, isi-matsuda index, and adiponectin continued to improve. multivariate analysis revealed that both visceral adiposity and estimated liver fat reductions contributed to the improved isi-matsuda index observed over 3 yr (r(2) = 0.28, p < 0.001). three-year changes in fat mass and crf were independently associated with changes in visceral fat (adjusted r(2) = 0.40, p < 0.001), whereas only changes in crf were associated with changes in estimated liver fat (adjusted r(2) = 0.18, p < 0.001). a long-term (3 yr) healthy eating/physical activity intervention in men improves several cardiometabolic risk markers over the long term (3 yr) despite a partial body weight regain observed between year 1 and year 3. the improvement in crf contributes to visceral and estimated liver fat losses over the long term, which in turn explain the benefits of the lifestyle intervention on cardiometabolic risk profile.
low_testosterone	background: an altered balance of gonadal hormones in males with gender identity disorders (gids) may increase multiple sclerosis (ms) risk both inherently and secondary to treatment in undergoing male-to-female conversion. objective: we investigated any association between gids and ms through analysis of record-linked hospital statistics. method: analysis of english hospital episode statistics, 1999-2012. results: the adjusted rate ratio (rr) of ms following gids in males was 6.63 (95% confidence interval (95% ci) = 1.81-17.01, p = 0.0002). the rr of ms following gids in females was 1.44 (95% ci = 0.47-3.37, p = 0.58). conclusion: we report a strong association between gids and ms in male-to-females, supporting a potential role for low testosterone and/or feminising hormones on ms risk in males.
low_testosterone	the present study aimed to test the hypothesis that testosterone deprivation impairs osteoblastic insulin signaling, decreases osteoblast survival, reduces bone density, and that obesity aggravates those deleterious effects in testosterone-deprived rats. twenty four male wistar rats underwent either a bilateral orchiectomy (o, n=12) or a sham operation (s, n=12). then the rats in each group were further divided into two subgroups fed with either a normal diet (nd) or a high-fat diet (hf) for 12 weeks. at the end of the protocol, blood samples were collected to determine metabolic parameters and osteocalcin ratios. the tibiae were collected to determine bone mass using microcomputed tomography and for osteoblast isolation. the results showed that rats fed with hf (sham-operated hf-fed rats (hfs) and orx hf-fed rats (hfo)) developed peripheral insulin resistance and had decreased trabecular bone density. in nd-fed rats, only the orx nd-fed rats (ndo) group had decreased trabecular bone density. in addition, osteoblastic insulin resistance, as indicated by a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and akt, were observed in all groups except the sham-operated nd-fed rats (nds) rats. those groups, again with the exception of the nds rats, also had decreased osteoblastic survival. no differences in the levels of osteoblastic insulin resistance and osteoblastic survival were found among the ndo, hfs, and hfo groups. these findings suggest that either testosterone deprivation or obesity alone can impair osteoblastic insulin signaling and decrease osteoblastic survival leading to the development of osteoporosis. however, obesity does not aggravate those deleterious effects in the bone of testosterone-deprived rats.
low_testosterone	aim: oxytocin regulates food intake, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and urinary sodium excretion. we assessed the association between serum oxytocin levels and presence of metabolic syndrome (mets) in older men. methods: cross-sectional study was performed in 540 volunteer men aged 50-85 yrs from the minos cohort. oxytocin was measured in fasting serum by radioimmunoassay (oxytocin ria, phoenix pharmaceuticals). mets was diagnosed using the harmonized definition. results: serum oxytocin was higher in 166 men with mets vs. controls (p < 0.005). after adjustment for confounders including leptin, higher oxytocin was associated with higher odds of mets (or = 1.38 per sd, 95% ci: 1.10-1.71, p0.74 pg/ml (median) had higher odds of mets vs. men with oxytocin 60.74 pg/ml (or = 2.06, 95% ci: 1.33-3.18, p0.74 pg/ml and total testosterone < 300 ng/dl (< 10.4 nmol/l) had higher odds of mets vs. men without these characteristics (or = 3.95, 95% ci: 1.65-9.46, p < 0.005). men having 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels0.74 pg/ml had higher odds of mets vs. men without these characteristics (or = 2.86, 95% ci: 1.47-5.58, p0.74 pg/ml and osteocalcin levels < 14.6 ng/ml (lowest quartile) had higher odds of mets vs. men without these characteristics (or = 4.12, 95% ci: 2.07-8.20, p < 0.001). conclusion: in older men, higher serum oxytocin levels are associated with higher odds of mets regardless of potential confounders.

low_testosterone	significant advances in health and social wellbeing have led to linear gains in life expectancy and an accompanying increase in the burden imposed by age-related morbidities. complex alterations in hormonal networks which regulate homeostasis and survival may underlie this poor adaptation to later life, as exemplified by an increased fracture risk amongst post-menopausal women. beyond overt under-or overactivity of hormonal axes, changes in the concentrations of regulatory hormones may also impact on health and disease. subclinical hyperthyroidism, a disorder characterised by normal thyroxine levels in the presence of decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone, is, for instance, independently associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation amongst elderly populations. both the menopause and subclinical thyroid disease demonstrate the difficulty in reversing endocrine changes in later life, with minimal impact from thyroxine therapy in subclinical hypothyroidism and multiple reports of harm resulting from hormone replacement therapy in peri-and post-menopausal women. given these findings, strategies to locally regulate hormone bioavailability by altering pre-receptor metabolism may offer greater therapeutic potential in the fight against age-related disease. this review aims to provide an overview of the ageing endocrine system and its potential impact on health and disease in the elderly. it will postulate that strategies to coordinate pre-receptor hormone metabolism and a greater understanding of putative hormonal longevity pathways may offer key new drug targets in the fight against ageing, and will argue against applying the conventional endocrine maxim of 'block and replace' to hormonal changes seen during ageing.

low_testosterone	background: it is not unusual for men over 60 years of age to have serum testosterone levels below the lower limits of younger men, prompting a diagnosis of hypogonadism. this study evaluated safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of oral enclomiphene citrate as an alternative to currently available androgen replacement therapies. methods: fifty-two subjects were randomized to oral enclomiphene citrate (12.5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg), topical testosterone gel (5 g) or oral placebo daily for 14 days. pharmacodynamic profiles of total testosterone (tt) were obtained on day 1 and day 14 after dosing. subjects were assessed in a follow-up visit 7-10 days after the final dose. additional subjects were rescreened and added for a 10-g dose cohort. results: after 14 days, there was a significant, dose-dependent rise in tt across all doses of enclomiphene citrate and topical testosterone, but not placebo. supraphysiologic levels of tt were observed in topical testosterone-treated subjects, whereas tt levels were maintained within a desirable range of 400 to 700 ng/dl in enclomiphene citrate-treated subjects. enclomiphene citrate 25 and 50 mg doses and topical testosterone (10 g) treatment elevated free testosterone levels more at day 14 compared with day 1 than did placebo. topical testosterone (5 g) was associated with disproportionate increase in dihydrotestosterone (dht) relative to tt, while enclomiphene citrate resulted in a modest decrease. enclomiphene citrate was rapidly absorbed and had an elimination half-life of about 10 hours. a non-dose-dependent steady-state level was maximal at the 25 mg dose. the effects of enclomiphene citrate were sustained with daily dosing. conclusions: enclomiphene citrate increased total and free testosterone without increasing dht disproportionately. changes in luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and the dht/tt ratio with enclomiphene citrate suggest it normalizes endogenous testosterone production pathways and restores normal testosterone levels in men with secondary hypogonadism within 14 days.
low_testosterone	testosterone deficiency is highly prevalent in up to 50% of men with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. low testosterone levels in men appear to be an independent cardiovascular risk factor and predictor of subsequent development of the metabolic syndrome. reciprocally, the metabolic syndrome leads to a decrease in testosterone levels. this review provides an account of the pathophysiological mechanisms in the bidirectional relationship between hypogonadism and body composition, inflammation and insulin sensitivity as well as the effects of testosterone replacement on diverse metabolic parameters.
low_testosterone	androgen deficiency occurs frequently in men with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. antiretroviral treatments had reduced the prevalence of male hypogonadism. the pathogenesis of testosterone (t) deficiency in hiv is multifactorial. several mechanisms have been proposed; among them, drugs, fat redistribution, and a poor health status could explain the mechanism leading to gonadotropins inhibition and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. the diagnosis of hypogonadism in hiv-infected men should be made based on clinical symptoms and a specific workup including t measurement. the interpretation of the results of biochemical testing is more difficult in men with hiv due to several confounding factors. t treatment should be offered to hiv-infected men with documented clinical hypogonadism and symptoms, especially if they are losing lean mass.
low_testosterone	epidemiological studies indicate that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) are at increased risk of developing dementia/alzheimer 's disease (ad). this review, which is based on recent studies, presents a molecular framework that links the two diseases and explains how physical training could help counteract neurodegeneration in t2dm patients. inflammatory, oxidative, and metabolic changes in t2dm patients cause cerebrovascular complications and can lead to blood-brain-barrier (bbb) breakdown. peripherally increased pro-inflammatory molecules can then pass the bbb more easily and activate stress-activated pathways, thereby promoting key pathological features of dementia/ad such as brain insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid (a beta) oligomers, leading to synaptic loss, neuronal dysfunction, and cell death. ceramides can also pass the bbb, induce pro-inflammatory reactions, and disturb brain insulin signaling. in a vicious circle, oxidative stress and the pro-inflammatory environment intensify, leading to further cognitive decline. low testosterone levels might be a common risk factor in t2dm and ad. regular physical exercise reinforces antioxidative capacity, reduces oxidative stress, and has anti-inflammatory effects. it improves endothelial function and might increase brain capillarization. physical training can further counteract dyslipidemia and reduce increased ceramide levels. it might also improve a beta clearance by up-regulating a beta transporters and, in some cases, increase basal testosterone levels. in addition, regular physical activity can induce neurogenesis. physical training should therefore be emphasized as a part of prevention programs developed for diabetic patients to minimize the risk of the onset of neurodegenerative diseases among this specific patient group.
low_testosterone	testosterone therapy is recommended for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency and unequivocally low testosterone levels. although the prevalence of hypogonadism seems relatively constant, studies of prescribing patterns in both the united states and the united kingdom show a dramatic increase in testosterone prescription in recent years, possibly due to increased marketing and inappropriate therapy. concurrent with this, there has been growing concern regarding the potential adverse effects of testosterone therapy, particularly its cardiovascular risks. in this review, we present our current understanding of the implications of testosterone deficiency, as well as the conflicting evidence surrounding the cardiovascular effects of testosterone replacement therapy. although there is a lack of adequate data, based on the current evidence, we conclude that testosterone therapy can be safely considered in men with appropriately diagnosed clinical androgen deficiency and increased cardiovascular risk after a thorough discussion of potential risks and with guideline recommended safety monitoring.
low_testosterone	serum testosterone is a potential marker to distinguish between indolent and aggressive prostate cancer (pca). the present study aimed to investigate whether low levels of total serum testosterone at diagnosis were associated with aggressive pca and poor clinical outcomes. in total, 762 non-hispanic caucasian men with previously untreated pca were recruited from the university of texas md anderson cancer center (houston, tx, usa). patients were categorized into three groups based on their total serum testosterone levels according to clinical guidelines [ low (350 ng/dl)]. pca aggressiveness (low-, intermediate-or high-risk, or metastatic) was compared using multinomial logistic regression. rates of disease progression, mortality from any cause and pca-specific mortality were compared using the multivariate cox proportional hazards model. testosterone levels significantly decreased as pca aggressiveness increased (p<0.001). compared with the normal testosterone group, the low testosterone group had 2.9-fold (or, 2.92; 95% ci, 1.74-4.90; p<0.001), 5.6-fold (or, 5.63; 95% ci, 3.14-10.12; p<0.001) and 72.4-fold (or, 72.40; 95% ci, 20.89-250.89; p<0.001) increased risks of having intermediate-risk, high-risk and metastatic pca, respectively. furthermore, low levels of testosterone were significantly associated with a 10.7-fold (hr, 10.68; 95% ci, 1.35-84.44; p=0.03) increased risk of pca-specific mortality. the results of the present study indicate that low levels of total serum testosterone at diagnosis are associated with aggressive pca and predict poor pca-specific survival.
fungal_infection	background: although over the past decade the management of invasive fungal infection has improved, considerable controversy persists regarding antifungal prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients. aims: to identify the key clinical knowledge and make by consensus the high level recommendations required for antifungal prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients. methods: spanish prospective questionnaire, which measures consensus through the delphi technique, was conducted anonymously and by e-mail with 30 national multidisciplinary experts, specialists in invasive fungal infections from six national scientific societies, including intensivists, anesthetists, micro-biologists, pharmacologists and specialists in infectious diseases that responded to 12 questions prepared by the coordination group, after an exhaustive review of the literature in the last few years. the level of agreement achieved among experts in each of the categories should be equal to or greater than 70% in order to make a clinical recommendation. in a second term, after extracting the recommendations of the selected topics, a face-to-face meeting was held with more than 60 specialists who were asked to validate the pre-selected recommendations and derived algorithm. measurements and primary outcomes: echinocandin antifungal prophylaxis should be considered in liver transplant with major risk factors (retransplantation, renal failure requiring dialysis after transplantation, pretransplant liver failure, not early reoperation, or meld>30); heart transplant with hemodialysis, and surgical re-exploration after transplantation; environmental colonization by aspergillus, or cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection; and pancreas and intestinal transplant in case of acute graft rejection, hemodialysis, initial graft dysfunction, post-perfusion pancreatitis with anastomotic problems or need for laparotomy after transplantation. antifungal fluconazole prophylaxis should be considered in liver transplant without major risk factors and meld 20-30, split or living donor, choledochojejunostomy, increased transfusion requirements, renal failure without replacement therapy, early reoperation, or multifocal colonization or infection with candida; intestinal and pancreas transplant with no risk factors for echinocandin treatment. liposomal amphotericin b antifungal prophylaxis should be considered in lung transplant (inhalant form) and liver transplant with major risk factors. antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole should be considered in lung transplant, and heart transplant with hemodialysis, surgical re-exploration after transplantation, environmental colonization by aspergillus, or cmv infection. conclusions: the management of antifungal prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients requires the application of knowledge and skills that are detailed in our recommendations and the algorithm developed therein. these recommendations, based on the delphi methodology, may help to identify potential patients, standardize their management and improve overall prognosis.

fungal_infection	plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), the major active constituent of plumbago indica l., has been shown to be effective against a wide range of infectious microbes. in this study, plumbagin has been evaluated in vitro for its antifungal combinatory effect with amphotericin b against candida albicans (c. albicans) clinical isolates and anti-hepatitis c virus (hcv) activity. antifungal activity was determined by broth microdilution method, and combinatory effect was evaluated by checkerboard assay according to sigma fic indices, while cytotoxicity was determined by mtt assay. anti-hcv activity was determined in infected huh7.5 cells using quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr, and cytotoxicity was evaluated by mtt assay. plumbagin exerted inhibitory effect against all c. albicans strains with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 7.41 to 11.24 mu g/ml. the additive effect of plumbagin when combined with amphotericin b at concentrations of (0.12, 0.13 and 0.19, 1.81 mu g/ml, respectively) was obtained against five of seven strains tested with sigma fic ranging from 0.62 to 0.91. in addition, plumbagin was found to be used safely for topical application when combined with amphotericin b at concentrations corresponding to the additive effect. plumbagin exerted anti-hcv activity compared with that of telaprevir with ic50 values of 0.57 and 0.01 mu m/l, respectively, and selectivity indices si = 53.7 and si = 2127, respectively. our results present plumbagin as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of c. albicans and hcv infections. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
fungal_infection	the purpose of this study was to determine whether intravoxel incoherent motion (ivim) -derived parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) could act as imaging biomarkers for predicting antifungal treatment response. forty-six consecutive patients (mean age, 33.9 +/- 13.0 y) with newly diagnosed invasive fungal infection (ifi) in the lung according to eortc/msg criteria were prospectively enrolled. all patients underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (mr) imaging at 3.0 t using 11 b values (0-1000 sec/mm(2)). adc, pseudodiffusion coffiecient d*, perfusion fraction f, and the diffusion coefficient d were compared between patients with favourable (n=32) and unfavourable response (n=14). f values were significantly lower in the unfavourable response group (12.6%+/- 4.4%) than in the favourable response group (30.2%+/- 8.6%) (z=4.989, p0.05). receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed f to be a significant predictor for differentiation, with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 92.9%. ivim-mri is potentially useful in the prediction of antifungal treatment response to patients with ifi in the lung. our results indicate that a low perfusion fraction f may be a noninvasive imaging biomarker for unfavourable response. aeuro cent recognition of ifi indicating clinical outcome is important for treatment decision-making. aeuro cent ivim can reflect diffusion and perfusion information of ifi lesions separately. aeuro cent perfusion characteristics of ifi lesions could help differentiate treatment response. aeuro cent an initial low f may predict unfavourable response in ifi.
fungal_infection	a female, captive bred, juvenile swell shark (cephaloscyllium ventriosum) was observed swimming in tight circles and rolling. radiographs and computed tomography of this individual revealed extensive cartilage mineralization of the skull and cranial cervical vertebrae compared with diagnostic images of clinically healthy conspecifics. gross necropsy and histopathologic examination revealed ossification and fibrosis of the cartilaginous matrix of the skull and cervical vertebrae with deep invasion by a pigmented hyphal fungus. there was no growth on fungal culture, but fungal polymerase chain reaction identified a dna sequence compatible with exophiala sp. (99%). radiographs and computed tomography were helpful to determine a prognosis and course of action for this individual. this case emphasizes the need to include fungal infections as a differential diagnosis when evaluating elasmobranchs with abnormal swimming behaviors and mineralization of the skeletal structures.
fungal_infection	posaconazole may be useful for salvage treatment (st) for invasive fungal infections (ifis). the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of posaconazole st with either posaconazole oral suspension (sus) or delayed-released tablet (tab) in patients with ifi. a retrospective review of patients who received posaconazole st for ifi at the university of utah health sciences center between december 2007 and march 2014 was conducted. a total of 14 episodes of posaconazole st for proven (9 episodes) and probable (5 episodes) ifi were identified in 14 patients. the median age was 54 years and the majority of patients (64.3%) had underlying haematological diseases. posaconazole sus and tab were used in 11 episodes and 3 episodes respectively. the duration of posaconazole st ranged from 28 to 370 days with a median of 65 days. posaconazole st with tab achieved favourable serum posaconazole trough concentrations (median 1.4 lg ml(-1)) compared to posaconazole sus (median 1.0 lg ml(-1)). the overall clinical success rate with posaconazole st was 71.4% (10 of 14 episodes). one patient died of progression of ifi. adverse events were noted in two patients. posaconazole sus or tab may be used effectively for ifi st.
fungal_infection	cystic fibrosis (cf) is a chronic pulmonary disease that is associated with persistent microbial infection and chronic neutrophil infiltration, and also with elevated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-17a (il-17). in the current study, we examined il-17 and the inducible il-17rc receptor subunit in neutrophils from pseudomonas aeruginosa infected f508del cf patients at the time of pulmonary exacerbation, and again following intravenous antibiotic treatment. neutrophils expressed il17a and il17rc transcripts and protein at the time of pulmonary exacerbation, which were absent following antibiotic treatment. further, cf sputum induced il-23 - dependent il17rc expression in neutrophils from healthy individuals. similarly, il-17 producing neutrophils were detected in f508del and cftr(-/-) mice infected intranasally with p. aeruginosa. in the sputum of cf subjects, the percentage il-17 producing neutrophils correlated with elastase and mmp9 activity; therefore, this population of neutrophils may be an important contributor to the severity of pulmonary disease in cf patients.

fungal_infection	cryptococcosis is a fungal infection, relatively rare in the absence of impaired immunity. lung or brain may be involved. cryptococcal dissemination is rare in absence of impaired immunity, and documentation of alone adrenal involvement without central nervous system involvement is rare. here, we present a case of an immunocompetent patient presented with bilateral adrenal cryptococcosis with adrenal insufficiency, without central nervous system involvement and 18f-fdg pet/ct correctly identified the residual disease.
fungal_infection	backgroundonychomycosis is principally caused by dermatophyte species, but nondermatophyte molds and yeasts have also been involved, causing different clinical manifestations. the aim of this investigation is to determine the clinicomycological and epidemiological profile of the etiologic agents of onychomycosis. methodsthe study population included 9,785 suspected cases of onychomycosis referred to the medical mycology reference laboratory in isfahan, iran, during 2007-2014. nail clipping was collected in sterile petri dishes for direct microscopic examination and culture. clinical isolates were identified by using phenotypic tests and molecular techniques. resultsof total 9,785 cases with clinical suspicion of onychomycosis comprised in the present study, 1,284 patients (13.1%) were positive by direct microscopy. age range of patients was between 1 and 82 years. housewives were the commonest infected population. candida albicans was the most prevalent species isolated from patients in this study (34.9%) followed by trichophyton interdigitale (11.7%) and aspergillus flavus (9.1%). conclusionthe pattern of causative agents and clinical signs of onychomycosis is altering region to region, so repeated epidemiological surveys of onychomycosis seems to be fundamental. the present study provides novel and appropriate epidemiologic data of onychomycosis for the better prevention and treatment of this fungal infection.
fungal_infection	as one popular fresh fruit, banana (musa acuminata) is cultivated in the world 's subtropical and tropical areas. in recent years, pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (foc) has been widely and rapidly spread to banana cultivated areas, causing substantial yield loss. however, the molecular mechanism of banana response to foc remains unclear, and functional identification of disease-related genes is also very limited. in this study, nine 90 kda heat-shock proteins (hsp90s) were genomewide identified. moreover, the expression profile of them in different organs, developmental stages, and in response to abiotic and fungal pathogen foc were systematically analyzed. notably, we found that the transcripts of 9 mahsp90s were commonly regulated by melatonin (n-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) and foc infection. further studies showed that exogenous application of melatonin improved banana resistance to fusarium wilt, but the effect was lost when cotreated with hsp90 inhibitor (geldanamycin, gda). moreover, melatonin and gda had opposite effect on auxin level in response to foc4, while melatonin and gda cotreated plants had no significant effect, suggesting the involvement of mahsp90s in the cross talk of melatonin and auxin in response to fungal infection. taken together, this study demonstrated that mahsp90s are essential for melatonin-mediated plant response to fusarium wilt, which extends our understanding the putative roles of mahsp90s as well as melatonin in the biological control of banana fusarium wilt.
fungal_infection	penicillium marneffei is a rare invasive fungal infection that primarily occurs in the southeastern and eastern regions of asia in hiv-positive individuals. herein we present a rare case of disseminated p. marneffei infection with fungemia and intestinal perforation in an hiv-negative patient in china. extensive diagnostic evaluations did not reveal the cause of the disease; we use the automated microbiology system, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (maldi) time-of-flight (tof) mass spectrometry (ms), polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and the sequencing analysis to detect and identify the pathogen in positive blood culture of patient. the pathogen was initially misdiagnosed as stephanoascus ciferrii by automated microbiology system. however the sequencing analysis revealed the pathogen to be p. marneffei. the patient was treated with amphotericin b, and a significant improvement in his condition was achieved. however, after a month, the patient suffered from an intestinal perforation, which may have been caused by p. marneffei. although p. marneffei has been found in select regions, and appears mostly in patients with a weak immune system, particularly hiv-positive individuals. it is important to note that in addition to patients who are hiv-positive, anyone with a weak immune system can be infected with p. marneffei. dna sequencing is generally considered to be the gold standard for the identification of microorganisms.
diabetes	aging-associated alterations in composition, diversity and functional features of intestinal microbiota are well-described in the modern literature. they are suggested to be caused by an age-related decline in immune system functioning (immunosenescence) and a low-grade chronic inflammation (inflammaging), which accompany many aging-associated pathologies. the microbiota-targeted dietary and probiotic interventions have been shown to favorably affect the host health and aging by an enhancement of antioxidant activity, improving immune homeostasis, suppression of chronic inflammation, regulation of fat deposition and metabolism and prevention of insulin resistance. recently, a high effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic application such as fecal microbiota transplantation in the prevention and treatment of age-related pathological conditions including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes and parkinson 's disease has been demonstrated. in this review, recent research findings are summarized on the role of gut micribiota in aging processes with emphasis on therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions in anti-aging medicine.

diabetes	retrograded starch is known to be resistant to digestion. we used enzyme kinetic experiments to examine how retrogradation of starch affects amylolysis catalysed by porcine pancreatic amylase. parallel studies employing differential scanning calorimetry, infra red spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and nmr spectroscopy were performed to monitor changes in supramolecular structure of gelatinised starch as it becomes retrograded. the total digestible starch and the catalytic efficiency of amylase were both decreased with increasing evidence of retrogradation. a purified sample of retrograded high amylose starch inhibited amylase directly. these new findings demonstrate that amylase binds to retrograded starch. therefore consumption of retrograded starch may not only be beneficial to health through depletion of total digestible starch, and therefore the metabolisable energy, but may also slow the rate of intestinal digestion through direct inhibition of alpha-amylase. such physiological effects have important implications for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

diabetes	recent studies have investigated the potential of type 1 diabetes mellitus-related autoantigens, such as heat shock protein 60, to induce immunological tolerance or to suppress the immune response. a functional 24-residue peptide derived from heat shock protein 60 (p277) has shown anti-type 1 diabetes mellitus potential in experimental animals and in clinical studies, but it also carries a potential atherogenic effect. in this study, we have modified p277 to retain an anti-type 1 diabetes mellitus effect and minimize the atherogenic potential by replacing the p277 b epitope with another diabetes-associated autoantigen, insulinoma antigen-2 (ia-2), to create the fusion peptide ia-2-p2. in streptozotocin-induced diabetic c57bl/6j mice, the ia-2-p2 peptide displayed similar anti-diabetic effects to the control p277 peptide. also, the ia-2-p2 peptide did not show atherogenic activity in a rabbit model. our findings indicate the potential of ia-2-p2 as a promising vaccine against type 1 diabetes mellitus.
diabetes	the human intestinal microbiome has important metabolic and immunological functions for the host and is part of the defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. antibiotics, probiotics, dietary measures, such as prebiotics, and the relatively newly established method of fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt, also known as fecal microbiome transfer) all influence the intestinal microbiome. the fmt procedure comprises the transmission of fecal microorganisms from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a patient. the aim of this intervention is to restore a normal microbiome in patients with diseases associated with dysbiosis. the only indication for fmt is currently multiple recurrence of clostridium difficile infections. approximately 85% of affected patients can be successfully treated by fmt compared to only about 30% treated conventionally with vancomycin. other possible therapeutic applications are chronic inflammatory and functional bowel diseases, insulin resistance and morbid obesity but these have to be evaluated further in clinical trials. knowledge on the optimal donor, the best dosage and the most appropriate route of administration is still limited. a careful donor selection is necessary. the implementation of fmt in germany is subject to the medicines act (arzneimittelgesetz, amg) with a duty of disclosure and personal implementation by the attending physician. by documentation in a central register long-term effects and side effects of fmt have to be evaluated.
diabetes	visfatin is an adipocytokine that plays a role in regulating periodontal inflammation by as yet identified mechanisms. it has been suggested that visfatin mediates inflammation via activation of the nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) signaling pathways which play a role in the inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of visfatin, nf-kappa b (nf-kappa b-1 and nf-kappa b-2), pi3k, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) in the tissue of healthy individuals and patients with periodontitis. tissue biopsy samples were obtained from 21 patients with chronic periodontitis and from the gingiva of 19 healthy individuals undergoing crown lengthening. the mrna expression levels of visfatin, nf-kappa b, pi3k, tnf-alpha, and il-1 beta were evaluated by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). also, visfatin protein expression was measured by immunohistochemistry. both qpcr and immunohistochemistry results revealed that the visfatin expression was higher in the tissues with periodontitis than in healthy tissues (p < 0.01). similarly, the mrna expression levels of nf-kappa b-2, pi3k, and il-1 beta were higher in tissues with periodontitis than in healthy gingival tissues (p < 0.01). visfatin was positively correlated with the levels of nf-kappa b-1 (r = 0.549, p < 0.05), nf-kappa b-2 (r = 0.636, p < 0.05), pi3k (r = 0.682, p < 0.01), tnf-alpha (r = 0.558, p < 0.05), and il-1 beta (r = 0.686, p < 0.01) in the tissues with periodontitis. our results demonstrated that increased visfatin was associated with the expression of nf-kappa b and pi3k which may play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. we suggest that increased visfatin may contribute to the inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis via the nf-kappa b and pi3k signaling pathways. understanding the role of visfatin in periodontitis will enable the development of new treatment methods for inflammation.
diabetes	bullous pemfigoid (bp), an autoimmune disorder, can also be induced by some medications. vildagliptin is a new drug used to treat diabetes mellitus (dm). recently, a few cases of vildagliptin-induced bp have been described in the literature. we report a patient with bp in which vildagliptin was thought to be as a possible causative agent. the awareness of bp development risk during gliptin therapy can prevent unnecessary usage of systemic drugs with serious side effects.
diabetes	consuming a healthy diet forms an important component of diabetes management; however, adhering to a healthy diet is challenging. dietary behaviour is often guided by socio-cultural, environmental and emotional factors, and not necessarily by physical and nutritional needs. this study explored nepalese patients' perceptions of the impact of diet, diet management requirement for diabetes and how nepalese food culture in particular influenced diet management. interviews were conducted with nepalese participants with type 2 diabetes in sydney and kathmandu; and data was thematically analysed. diet was recognized as a cause of, and a key treatment modality, in diabetes. besides doctors, participants in nepal received a large amount of dietary information from the community. dietary changes formed a major component of lifestyle modifications adopted after diagnosis, and mostly consisted of removal of foods with added sugar and foods with high total sugar content from the diet, and a reduction in overall quantity of foods consumed. perceived dietary restriction requirements created social and emotional discomfort to patients. most participants perceived the nepalese food culture as a barrier to effective diet management. meals high in carbohydrates, limited food choices, and food preparation methods were identified as barriers, particularly in nepal. in australia, participants reported greater availability and easier access to appropriate food, and healthier cooking options. the socio-cultural aspects of food behaviour, mainly, food practices during social events were identified as significant barriers. although diet was acknowledged as an important component of diabetes care, and most adopted changes in their diet post-diagnosis, effective and sustained changes were difficult to achieve. future public health campaigns and education strategies should focus on improving diet knowledge, awareness of food options for diabetes, and effective dietary management.

diabetes	backgroundin the parent study of this analysis, patients with type 2 diabetes received lixisenatide before breakfast or the main meal of the day. this substudy was designed to examine the effect of lixisenatide administered before breakfast or the main meal of the day on continuously assessed 24-hour patient glucose profiles. methodsa subset of patients from the parent study underwent 2 14-day periods of continuous glucose monitoring (cgm) at the start and end of the 24-week study. ambulatory glucose profile analysis was used to measure changes over time in detailed aspects of the glucose profiles. the breakfast group consumed a standardized meal during both cgm periods to determine change in 4-hour glycemic response. resultsdata were available for 69 patients in the substudy, 40 from the original breakfast group and 29 from the main meal group. between baseline and end of study, mean (standard deviation) total glucose exposure decreased from 4198.1 (652.3) to 3681.2 (699.6)mg/dl*24h in the breakfast group (p<.0001) and from 4127.9 (876.8) to 3880.9 (1165.0)mg/dl*24h in the main meal group (p=.0224). for patients included in the substudy, hba(1c) decreased by approximately 0.6% in both groups. mean (standard deviation) 4-hour total glucose exposure fell by 168.9 (158.4)mg/dl*4h (p<.0001) from baseline. conclusionsthis analysis demonstrates that lixisenatide has beneficial effects on components of the 24-hour glucose profile, which endure beyond the meal at which it is administered. continuous glucose monitoring analysis detects changes not captured using hba(1c) alone.
diabetes	in this paper, we report a series of eighteen novel pyrimidine-based thiourea compounds with good to excellent yields (61-88%). the chemical structures of these heterocycles consist of a central pyrimidine ring with phenyl-substituted thiourea motifs. the enzyme inhibitory potential of these compounds was investigated against alpha-glucosidase as this enzyme plays a crucial role in treating type ii diabetes mellitus. compounds 4i (ic50 = 22.46 +/- 0.65 a mu m), 4f (ic50 = 25.88 +/- 0.40 a mu m), 4h (ic50 = 27.63 +/- 0.49 a mu m), 4c (ic50 = 29.47 +/- 0.42 a mu m), and 4e (ic50 = 32.01 +/- 0.42 a mu m) delivered better inhibition than the reference compound acarbose (ic50 38.22 +/- 0.12 a mu m). the quantitative structure-activity relationship of the synthesized compounds was also studied.
diabetes	lactation may protect women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) from developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, but the results of existing studies are inconsistent, ranging from null to beneficial. we aimed to conduct a systematic review to gather available evidence. databases medline, cinahl, pubmed, and embase were searched on december 15, 2015, without restriction of language or publication year. a manual search was also conducted. we included observational studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort study) with information on lactation and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence among women with previous gdm. we excluded case studies without control data. data synthesis was conducted by random-effect meta-analysis. fourteen reports of 9 studies were included. overall risk of bias using robans ranged from low to unclear. longer lactation for more than 4 to 12weeks postpartum had risk reduction of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with shorter lactation (or 0.77, 95% ci 0.01-55.86; or 0.56, 95% ci 0.35-0.89; or 0.22, 95% ci 0.13-0.36; type 2 diabetes mellitus evaluation time5y, respectively). exclusive lactation for more than 6 to 9weeks postpartum also had lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with exclusive formula (or 0.42, 95% ci 0.22-0.81). the findings support the evidence that longer and exclusive lactation may be beneficial for type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention in women with previous gdm. however, the evidence relies only on observational studies. therefore, further studies are required to address the true causal effect.
parenting	objective: in an effort to address the lack of evidence-based interventions for adhd in developing south asian countries, we examined the preliminary efficacy of a behavioral parent training program in pakistan. method: a quasi-experimental design was utilized. eighty-five 4- to 12-year-old children with clinically significant adhd symptoms participated: 55 were recruited from hospital clinics (active treatment group) and 30 were recruited from schools (waitlist control group). parent and teacher ratings of adhd, oppositional defiant disorder (odd), and conduct disorder (cd) symptoms and impairment were collected. results: using intent-to-treat analyses, the treatment group showed significant pre-post improvement on parent-reported odd symptoms and adhd-related impairment. teacher ratings showed no improvement. conclusion: this study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of behavioral parenting training for children with adhd in pakistan and represents a critical first step in identifying evidence-based treatments for pakistani children with adhd.
parenting	the purpose of this study is to find patterns in the latent profiles of behavioral problems of children aged 4, 5, and 6, in the child and caregiver variables that affected the composition of the latent profile group, and in the differences in children 's social skills by latent profile groups. the study relies on a sample of 1461 children enrolled in the panel study on korean children. fostering children 's social abilities has been stressed in recent policy documents in korea, including the character education promotion act and the recently introduced nuri curriculum. therefore, the current paper investigates factors influencing children 's behavior problems via a longitudinal analysis. a latent profile analysis was performed and resulted in three profile models. our findings are as follows: first, according to the latent profile of children 's behavior problems, we came up with three group models that best fit the data. group 1, named the non-problem group, had at all ages below standard scores for behavioral problems. group 2, named the normal group, had average or slightly above average scores for behavioral problems, though such problems decreased as the child got older. group 3, named the in-danger group, had average or above standard scores for externalizing behavioral problems, while the scores for internalizing behavioral problems were above the subclinical standard point at age 4 and at the clinical standard point at ages 5 and 6. second, after exploring the influencing factors (at child and parent levels) for children belonging to the in-danger group, the study found that the child was more likely to belong to the in-danger group if female, if the level of activity and sociality was low, if the mother 's parenting stress was high, and if the family income was low. lastly, the study looked into whether there were any group differences in young children 's social skills. the findings show that regarding capacity for cooperation and self-control, the scores of the non-problem group were higher than those for the in-danger group. regarding capacity for exhibiting assertiveness and responsibility, the lowest scores among the three groups belonged to the in-danger group.
parenting	postnatal depression (pnd) is common and negatively affects the mother-infant relationship; oxytocin (ot) has been found to have positive effects on parenting, although psychiatric disorders may reduce these effects. thus, we explored the role of ot in mothers diagnosed with pnd. a within-subject, randomized controlled double-blind design was used to test the effects of nasal administration of ot or placebo on sensitive caregiving. the outcome measures were perceptual and caregiving responses to prerecorded cry sounds, as well as observed maternal sensitivity. we found that in the ot condition mothers with pnd were more likely to rate an infant cry as more urgent and they were more likely to indicate they would chose a harsh caregiving strategy in response. there was no effect of ot on maternal sensitive interaction with their own baby. further research is required prior to consideration of ot administration in depressed mothers of infants.
parenting	youth ageing out of the child welfare system become parents at rates two to three times higher than their non-child welfare system involved peers. substantial literature acknowledges that youth ageing out who are parenting are vulnerable; yet, little is known about their lived experiences. social capital, or the actual or potential resources available from one 's network, can provide essential resources for the wellbeing of parents ageing out. this qualitative study examined social capital of mothers ageing out from the perspectives of both mothers and service providers. we conducted small group interviews with 13 mothers ageing out and 14 service providers. data were analysed using thematic analysis. findings revealed the use of a social capital framework delineates that mothers lacked beneficial social relationships and, consequently, support. a lack of trust coupled with a desire to break intergenerational patterns and norms contributed to understanding why mothers ageing out may not capitalize on resources that providers often considered available. based on findings, we conclude that providing mothers ageing out with additional opportunities to develop trust, positive relationships with mentors and extended services may help to disrupt intergenerational patterns of maltreatment and promote child and family wellbeing.
parenting	children spend a lot of time with their parents who are the first agents that educate them. the parenting style implemented in the family influences other contexts outside home such as the school. there is evidence that a positive parenting style has an influence on school success. however, there are other variables related to school success, for example, temperament. the influence of parenting decreases with age as children develop abilities to self-regulate without parents' external control. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of parenting style and temperament in 9-13 years old children on both academic performance and school adjustment skills. our hypothesis was that not only parenting style is crucial to academic performance and school adjustment, but also temperament plays an important role in them. we used a parenting guide line questionnaire to evaluate parenting style, early adolescence temperament questionnaire-r to evaluate temperament; health resources inventory to assess children 's school adjustment, and academic grades, as indicator of academic performance. we were interested in testing whether or not the effect of parenting style on academic performance and school adjustment was mediated by temperament. we found that emotional and behavioral regulationmediates the relation between parenting and academic performance. these findings inform of the relevance of child 's temperament on school success. implications for education are discussed with emphasis on the importance of understanding students' temperament to promote school adjustment and good academic performance.
parenting	the children 's eating behaviour questionnaire (cebq) was developed to measure eating behaviors related to obesity risk in children. however, this questionnaire has not been validated for use in south east asia, where parenting practices are different from those in western countries and child obesity rates are increasing. the aim of this study was to examine the validity of the cebq administered to mothers of children aged 3 years in singapore. confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) was used to examine if the original 35-item, 8-factor model was supported in our cohort. participants were 636 mother-child dyads (mean (sd) child age = 36.7 (1.6) months), from the growing up in singapore towards healthy outcomes (gusto) birth cohort in which the mothers were characterized in pregnancy and children were followed up to age 3 years. the cfa showed a poor model fit; rmsea = 0.072 (pclose= 0.35): enjoyment of food, food fussiness, emotional overeating, desire to drink, emotional under eating, satiety responsiveness and slowness in eating. cronbach 's alpha estimates ranged from 0.70 to 0.88 for the 7 subscales. convergent validity tests via correlation analysis revealed that emotional under eating (r = -0.14), slowness in eating (r = -0.16) and satiety responsiveness (r = -0.11) were negatively correlated with bmi z-score at 3 years, while enjoyment of food (r = 0.12) was positively correlated, p < 0.05. in conclusion, we found a revised 7-factor structure of the cebq more appropriate for examining eating behavior in 3 year old children in the singapore setting. further replication studies in a separate cohort study are warranted before further use of these factor structures generated.

parenting	parent training (pt) delivered as a guided self-help intervention may be a cost- and time-effective intervention in the treatment of children with externalizing disorders. in face-to-face pt, parenting strategies have repeatedly been identified as mediating mechanisms for the decrease of children 's problem behavior. few studies have examined possible mediating effects in guided self-help interventions for parents. the present study aimed to investigate possible mediating variables of a behaviorally oriented guided self-help program for parents of children with externalizing problems compared to a nondirective intervention in a clinical sample. a sample of 110 parents of children with externalizing disorders (80 % boys) were randomized to either a behaviorally oriented or a nondirective guided self-help program. four putative mediating variables were examined simultaneously in a multiple mediation model using structural equation modelling. the outcomes were child symptoms of adhd and odd as well as child externalizing problems, assessed at posttreatment. analyses showed a significant indirect effect for dysfunctional parental attributions in favor of the group receiving the behavioral program, and significant effects of the behavioral program on positive and negative parenting and parental self-efficacy, compared to the nondirective intervention. our results indicate that a decrease of dysfunctional parental attributions leads to a decrease of child externalizing problems when parents take part in a behaviorally oriented guided self-help program. however, none of the putative mediating variables could explain the decrease in child externalizing behavior problems in the nondirective group. a change in dysfunctional parental attributions should be considered as a possible mediator in the context of pt.
parenting	background: the american academy of pediatrics recommends the consideration of the ability and confidence of a caregiver to take care of a preterm infant before discharge (d/c). objective: to identify how parental self-efficacy as measured by the infant care survey (ics) evolves during their preterm child 's neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) admission, and to identify conditions associated with caregiver confidence. methods: prospective cohort study involving parents of infants <= 32 weeks gestation who were enrolled between 10-20 days of their infant 's life. parent/infant demographic, pregnancy, nicu, and d/c data was collected. parents responded to the ics at enrollment and d/c. enrollment and d/c ics scores were compared to one another using a paired samples t-test to assess the change in scores over time. further, conditions which are thought to affect self-efficacy were compared to enrollment, d/c, and the change in total ics scores to assess for correlations. results: total ics scores showed significant improvement from enrollment to d/c: (188.3 +/- 60.5 vs. 235.9 +/- 20.9). when comparing caregivers who did not have other children in the home to parents who did, caregivers without previous children had significantly lower ics scores at enrollment (149.8 +/- 64.0 vs. 221.7 +/- 31.2); however, d/c ics scores were similar (228.7 +/- 23.1 vs. 242.1 +/- 17.2). this was the result of a more profound improvement in self- efficacy amongst first time parents during their child 's nicu admission (79.0 +/- 68.1 vs. 20.3 +/- 35.2). conclusion: despite the stress and anxiety of having a child in the nicu, parental self- efficacy is likely to significantly improve during their child 's hospitalization. this was most evident amongst first time parents. we suspect that parental participation in their infant 's care and formal educational opportunities contribute to improvement in confidence over time.
parenting	adverse parenting is associated with an increased risk for the development of mood and behavioral disorders. in this study, we assessed the perceived parental bonding of 232 medical students using the parental bonding instrument (pbi) and extracted 22 students who reported their parents' rearing attitudes as affectionless control (low; low care, high overprotection). using the 28-item general health questionnaire, the zung self-rating depression scale (zung-sds), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), and the spielberger state-trait-anxiety-inventory (stai), physical and mental state of the low students were compared with those of 30 students who reported their parental bonding as optimal (opt; high care and low overprotection). these questionnaire measurements demonstrated significantly higher anxiety and depressive mood in the low students versus the opt students. compared with the opt students, the low students also exhibited a significantly reduced salivary cortisol awakening response (car) without changes across the rest of the diurnal salivary cortisol profile. among glucocorticoid-related genes examined (gr, adrb2, ib, il10, il1r2, il1rn, mr, mc2r, tgfb1, tgfb2 and faslg), real-time reverse transcription-pcr showed that the low students significantly increased expression of a dominant negative glucocorticoid receptor (gr) mrna and decreased 2-adrenergic receptor (adrb2) mrna levels in circulating leukocytes. these results suggest that negative perception of parents' child-rearing attitudes may be associated with anxiety and depressive mood and altered glucocorticoid signaling even in healthy young adults.
parenting	background: patients with advanced cancer who have dependent children are an important population with a life-limiting illness and high levels of psychological distress. few studies have addressed the experience of being a parent with advanced cancer and their potential palliative needs. aim: to describe the experience of living with advanced cancer as a parent, including illness experience, parental concerns, and treatment decision making and to explore whether these experiences differ by their functional status. design: we conducted a cross-sectional, qualitative study using in-depth, semi-structured interviews. data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. setting and participants: a total of 42 participants with metastatic cancer and with at least one child under the age of 18 years were recruited from a comprehensive cancer center. 25 participants were rated as having high functional status (the eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status scale = 0-1) and 17 with low functional status (ecog=2-4). results: we identified four themes regarding the experience of being a parent with advanced cancer: (1) parental concerns about the impact of their illness and death on their children, (2) ""missing out"" and losses of parental role and responsibilities, (3) maintaining parental responsibilities despite life-limiting illness, and (4) parental identity influencing decision making about treatment. parental functional status influenced not only physical responsibilities but also intensified parenting psychological concerns. conclusion: parents with metastatic cancer may have unique palliative care needs as they experience parenting concerns while managing the psychological and physical demands of advanced cancer.
birth_control	utilizing variation across u.s. state abortion restrictions on minors and different levels of provider availability, we measure whether women under the age of 25 are less careful in using contraception if abortions are less costly, in terms of both financial and opportunity cost. the effects of abortion restrictions for minors are largest and the most significant for women aged 18 and younger, and the effect of these restrictions decrease in magnitude and significance gradually as women age. as the percent of the state 's women without a provider increases, abortions are more difficult to obtain, and women are more likely to use the pill. when a larger percentage of women have a provider, abortions are more easily obtained, and there is a negative effect on pill usage. these results indicate that young women are forward thinking when making their contraceptive decisions, relative to the direct and indirect restrictions on abortion access.

birth_control	purpose: to examine young men 's awareness of emergency contraception (ec) and its association with their contraceptive decision-making contributions within a relationship. methods: a convenience sample of english-speaking male patients aged 13-24 years were surveyed regarding their childbearing intentions, contraceptive awareness (including ec), perceived contraceptive knowledge, and communication about birth control with providers and within a relationship. results: an ethnically diverse sample of adolescent males was recruited with a mean age of 18.9 years. most had previously been sexually active (75%) and felt it was important to avoid pregnancy (84%) and 61% reported ever having spoken to a health care provider about birth control (other than condoms), but only 42% had heard of ec. participants who had heard of ec were more likely to have spoken to a health care provider about contraception in the past (51.5% vs. 29.8%; p = .050), to feel they should participate in contraceptive decisions in a relationship (97.4% vs. 76.5%; p = .006), and to have discussed contraception with a partner (76.9% vs. 29.2%; p < .001). conclusions: counseling young men about ec, as well as other methods of birth control, may empower them to become actively involved in contraceptive decisions within a relationship if they do not desire fatherhood.

birth_control	background: women having a termination of pregnancy (top) have higher rates of chlamydia trachomatis (ct) than the general population. in this study, we explored ct treatment and prevention in dutch top clinics in comparison to that provided in great britain (gb). methods: a qualitative study including 14 semi-structured interviews with health care professionals (hcps) in top clinics (the netherlands: 9, gb: 5). interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed by thematic content analysis. results: prophylactic treatment with azithromycin is routinely prescribed after surgical top, but not after medical top ('abortion pill'). sexually transmitted infections (sti) tests are offered to clients who are considered at high risk of having sti. uptake varies according to health insurance coverage of sti testing. some dutch clinics are able to provide free testing for women under 25 years of age. sexual health counselling is often limited to discussing birth control. the major difference between the netherlands and gb is that gb top clinics more often offer free sti testing and prophylaxis to their clients. conclusion: hcps in dutch top clinics consider sti testing an important part of their service, but financial barriers prevent testing on location. dutch top clinics should offer sti tests to all women, and collaboration with public health services could improve sti testing and counselling for young people. furthermore, clinics should treat all top clients with prophylactic azithromycin. this could prevent ct and other upper genital tract post-abortion infections.
birth_control	fertility and reproductive behaviour in the nineteenth-century lutheran family from the city of poznan was characterized. use was made of the st. peter parish (peterkirche) registers from 1840s to 1870s, upon which reconstructions of the individual histories of 463 families were based. fertility was assessed on the basis of the length of between-birth intervals according to their order and age of women. next, the age-specific fertility rates of women f(x) and coale index of marital fertility i-g were calculated. from a seasonal rhythm of both marital and illegitimate births, and reconstructed on the basis of these, the annual rhythm of marital and prenuptial conceptions were characterized. in the lutheran parish of st. peter from the city of poznan illegitimate births and prenuptial conceptions accounted for almost 10% and over 5% of all births, respectively. lack of seasonality for marital births was noted here. illegitimate births, by contrast, were characterized by a statistically significant annual rhythm: their maximum was noted in april, which was a result of conceptions during summer. the average woman with completed reproduction cycle gave birth to the first and to the last child at the ages of 29 and 40 years, respectively. she therefore used 32% of her whole reproductive period. late age of birth of the first child was associated with late age of marriage of women (on average 28 years). an average woman with completed reproduction gave birth to 4.8 children. the average length of the protogenesic interval was 18 months. the highest fertility occurred in women aged between 20 to 29 years. the value of the i-g index was 0.67, and proved a lack of birth control rather than conscious birth regulation. generally, lutheran women from poznan were characterized by fairly high reproductive potential.
birth_control	objective: to determine the contraceptive practices of women after surgical repair of obstetric fistula and to assess determinants of uptake and the pregnancy rate in the first year. methods: a prospective cohort study enrolled women who had a successful surgical repair of obstetric fistula at a center in nigeria between 2011 and 2013. patients were followed up for 1 year. data were obtained through record review and completion of a semi-structured questionnaire. results: among 188 participants, 180 (95.7%) were aware of contraception, but only 70 (37.2%) used contraceptive methods after surgery. the most commonly used methods were the male condom (50 [71.4%] of 70) and hormonal injections (14 [20.0%]). the main reasons for non-use were fear of adverse effects (48 [40.7%] of 118 women), future desire for more children (35 [29.7%]), religious prohibition (26 [22.0%]), cultural beliefs (29 [24.6%]), and partner disapproval (42[35.6%]). the risk of unplanned pregnancy in the first year was significantly lower among women who used contraceptives than among those who did not (relative risk 0.14,95% confidence interval 0.02-1.06; p = 0.03). conclusion: contraceptive uptake for birth control after fistula repair surgery was low because of socioeconomic reasons, religious and cultural beliefs, and myths, resulting in unplanned pregnancies.

birth_control	objective(s): interest has increased regarding the issue of contraception in transplant recipients. the purpose of this study was to assess birth control selection and the role of contraceptive counseling sessions in female kidney transplant (kt) and liver transplant (lt) recipients. study design: a cross-sectional single-center survey study of 217 female organ recipients (kt, 137 and lt, 80), aged 18-45 years, met the study criteria. patients were asked 43 questions regarding their pre- and posttransplantation use of contraceptive methods, birth control awareness, contraception counseling and the factors determining the selection of effective contraception (hormonal contraception, intrauterine devices and female sterilization). results: thirty-three percent (5/15) of patients who had undergone the transplantation within 1 year prior to study inclusion were unaware of the necessity to use contraception. both of the groups studied did not differ significantly in terms of the rates of pre- and posttransplantation consultations on effective contraception (kt: 26% vs. 34%; p=0.153 and lt 38% vs. 35%; p=0.729). effective posttransplantation contraception was used by one in three patients, as indicated by posttransplantation consultations (kt: 30% vs. lt: 29%; p=0.910). the following factors affected the posttransplantation use of effective contraception: the presence of posttransplantation counseling on effective contraception [odds ratio (or): 6.67; 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.12-20.1] and infrequent sexual activity prior to transplantation (or: 0.56; 95% ci: 0.35-0.89). conclusion(s): the selection of effective contraception in kt and lt recipients remain suboptimal. despite the low numbers of women who received contraceptive counseling in this study, consultation was nonetheless associated with choosing an effective method of contraception.

birth_control	the international contest has strongly influenced the historiography of demographic policies in romania, bulgaria and the former yugoslavia. before 1989, national regimes justified their severe birth control policies as necessary to the productive system and their healthcare. at the time, most western scholars considered this an expression of an attempt to extend a widespread control over all aspects of society. the peculiarity of the demographic policy of yugoslavia, which was far more liberal than those of romania and bulgaria, was considered proof of the heterodoxy of its regime. the end of cold war and the dramatic events of the nineties in the former yugoslavia fostered the development of a new, domestic historiography, which actively supported the policies of population growth promoted in the region, and particularly in serbia. on the contrary, with the exception of some anthropological and sociological works, interest has declined for what concerns many of the states of the former soviet bloc.
birth_control	progesterone (prog) is a naturally occurring progestagen, which has been used to prevent preterm birth, control persistent anovulatory bleeding, and treat premenstrual syndrome in clinical practices. studies on the metabolism of prog have demonstrated that prog is the precursor of other steroids such as 5 beta-pregnane-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol (pd), testosterone (t), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. pd is the most commonly used endogenous reference compound (erc) in the isotope ratio mass spectrometry (irms) analysis for doping control. it is expected that the prog administration could affect the carbon isotope ratios (c-13/c-12, expressed as delta c-13-value) of pd and t metabolites, and lead to the false-negative or false-positive results in doping test. the influences of oral and intramuscular administration of prog on the urinary steroid profile and carbon isotope ratios of steroids were investigated in this study. it was demonstrated that the urine concentrations and the delta c-13-values of pd were affected obviously. the depleted delta c-13-values of pd could be used to suggest prog administration. using pd as erc may result in the distorted evaluation for suspicious urine sample in irms analysis when prog is ingested. the 5 alpha-androst-16-en-3 alpha-ol and 11 beta-hydroxyandrosterone could be used as the alternative ercs in case of prog administration. the carbon isotope ratios of androsterone (an) and etiocholanolone (etio), two t metabolites, remained unchanged throughout the excretion study, which suggested that the delta values of an and etio could still be used as the urinary markers of t administration even when prog was administrated.
birth_control	objective: reproductive coercion (rc) birth control sabotage and coercion by male partners to become pregnant and to control the outcome of a pregnancy has been associated with a history of both intimate partner physical and sexual violence (tpv) and unintended pregnancy among females utilizing reproductive health services. the temporal nature of associations of rc and unintended pregnancy (distinct from the impact of tv), however, has remained less clear. study design: a survey was administered to females aged 16-29 years seeking care in 24 rural and urban family planning clinics in pennsylvania (n=3539). results: five percent of respondents reported rc in the past 3 months, and 12% reported an unintended pregnancy in the past year. among those who reported recent rc, 21% reported past-year unintended pregnancy. compared to women exposed to neither condition, exposure to recent rc increased the odds of past-year unintended pregnancy, both in the absence of a history of ipv [adjusted odds ratio (aor) 1.79, 1.06-2.03] and in combination with a history of ipv (aor 2.00, 1.15-3.48); history of ipv without recent rc was also associated with unintended pregnancy (aor 1.80, 1.42-2.26). conclusions: findings indicate the temporal proximity of the association of rc and unintended pregnancy, with recent rc related to past-year unintended pregnancy, both independently and in combination with a history of ipv. recent rc is relatively prevalent among young women using family planning clinics and is associated with increased risk for past-year unintended pregnancy even in the absence of ipv. implications: recent rc and a history of ipv are prevalent among female family planning clients, particularly younger women, and these experiences are each associated with unintended pregnancy. pregnancy prevention counseling should include not only assessment for physical and sexual partner violence but also specific inquiry about rc.

birth_control	objective: to examine reproductive coercion and partner violence among college women. design: cross-sectional, descriptive. setting: a large public university in the northeast united states. participants: inclusion criteria were college women age 18 to 25, enrolled either full-or part-time, english speaking, and screened positive for relationship. data from 972 women were analyzed. methods: an e-mail invitation to participate in an electronic survey was sent to undergraduate and graduate female students. a web link to the informed consent and inclusion criteria were provided. students who affirmed they met inclusion criteria could proceed to the survey. completion of the survey implied consent. results: nearly 8% of participants (n = 76) reported reproductive coercion, including pregnancy coercion, birth control sabotage, or both. women reported more pregnancy coercion (6.8%) than birth control sabotage (3.9%). being told not to use any birth control was the most commonly reported act (6.8%, n = 62). of women reporting reproductive coercion (n = 76), 57% also screened for positive relationship violence (95% confidence interval [ci] [2.74, 7.29]). conclusion: pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage occur among college women, and higher rates were reported among women with histories of partner violence. in addition to screening and counseling for partner violence, college health providers should assess for reproductive coercion and tailor contraceptive counseling discussions accordingly.
heart_disease	purpose. worksite health promotion (whp) programs can reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease risk factors. state law can encourage employers and employer-provided insurance companies to offer comprehensive whp programs. this research examines state law authorizing whp programs. design. quantitative content analysis. setting. worksites or workplaces. subjects. united states (and the district of columbia). intervention. state law in effect in 2013 authorizing whp programs. measures. frequency and distribution of states with whp laws. analysis. to determine the content of the laws for analysis and coding, we identified 18 policy elements, 12 from the centers for disease control and prevention 's worksite health scorecard (hsc) and 6 additional supportive whp strategies. we used these strategies as key words to search for laws authorizing whp programs or select whp elements. we calculated the number and type of whp elements for each state with whp laws and selected two case examples from states with comprehensive whp laws. results. twenty-four states authorized onsite whp programs, 29 authorized whp through employer-provided insurance plans, and 18 authorized both. seven states had a comprehensive whp strategy, addressing 8 or more of 12 hsc elements. the most common hsc elements were weight management, tobacco cessation, and physical activity. conclusion. most states had laws encouraging the adoption of whp programs. massachusetts and maine are implementing comprehensive whp laws but studies evaluating their health impact are needed.
heart_disease	backgroundrecent human studies have evaluated the effect of daily apple consumption on plasma cholesterol level, which is recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (cvd). nevertheless, slightly significant effects have been generally registered although consuming more than two apples a day for several weeks. resultsthis study describes the influence of daily consumption of annurca apples on the cholesterol levels of mildly hypercholesterolaemic healthy subjects. a monocentric, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 4-month study was conducted. the subjects (n = 250) were randomly assigned to five treatment groups (each one of 50 subjects: 28 men and 22 women). four groups were administered one apple per day among the following: red delicious, granny smith, fuji, golden delicious. the fifth group was asked to consume two annurca apples per day, since the weight of this cultivar is on average half that of the commercial ones considered in this study. comparing results, annurca led to the most significant outcome, allowing a reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 8.3% and 14.5%, respectively, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 15.2% (all p < 0.001). conclusionour data would reasonably indicate annurca apple as a useful tool to contribute to the prevention of cvd risk through normal diet.

heart_disease	purpose of review thoracic radiation therapy is an effective treatment for several malignancies, such as hodgkin 's lymphoma and breast cancer. over the years, however, the incidence of cardiovascular events has increased in these patients, notably in younger survivors who do not have traditional risk factors. this review summarizes the pathology, incidence, clinical presentation, and management of cardiac events after radiation therapy. recent findings mediastinal radiation therapy accelerates the atherosclerosis process, resulting in early onset coronary artery disease. valvular disease due to radiation therapy typically affects the left-sided valves, with aortic regurgitation being the most common. rarely, it may lead to aortic stenosis requiring surgical interventions. pericardial involvement includes acute and chronic pericardial disease and pericardial effusion. new studies are investigating the prevalence and pathogenesis of autonomic dysfunction in cancer survivors who have undergone mediastinal and neck radiation. summary radiation therapy itself causes vascular endothelial dysfunction, resulting in clinical cardiovascular events, manifesting many years after completion of therapy. there remains little guidance regarding screening and therapies to prevent cardiovascular events in this population.
heart_disease	postoperative blindness (pb) primarily involves reception and conductance parts of the visual pathway due to ischemia following cessation of blood supply, for example, retinal vascular occlusion. although a rare cause of pb, cortical blindness (cb), which results from ischemia/infarction of visual cortex, has a poor outcome due to its mostly nonreversible nature. ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common cause of pb following cardiac surgeries. cb following cardiac surgeries involving cardiopulmonary bypass has been rarely reported. only a few of those articles reported partial or complete reversal of cb. we report an incidence of transient cb in an 11-year-old child who was operated for double chambered right ventricle with ventricular septal defect.
heart_disease	background: hereditary proximal spinal muscular atrophy (sma) is a severe neuromuscular disease of childhood caused by homozygous loss of function of the survival motor neuron (smn) 1 gene. the presence of a second, nearly identical smn gene (smn2) in the human genome ensures production of residual levels of the ubiquitously expressed smn protein. alpha-motor neurons in the ventral horns of the spinal cord are most vulnerable to reduced smn concentrations but the development or function of other tissues may also be affected, and cardiovascular abnormalities have frequently been reported both in patients and sma mouse models. methods: we systematically reviewed reported cardiac pathology in relation to smn deficiency. to investigate the relevance of the possible association in more detail, we used clinical classification systems to characterize structural cardiac defects and arrhythmias. conclusions: seventy-two studies with a total of 264 sma patients with reported cardiac pathology were identified, along with 14 publications on sma mouse models with abnormalities of the heart. structural cardiac pathology, mainly septal defects and abnormalities of the cardiac outflow tract, was reported predominantly in the most severely affected patients (i.e. sma type 1). cardiac rhythm disorders were most frequently reported in patients with milder sma types (e.g. sma type 3). all included studies lacked control groups and a standardized approach for cardiac evaluation. the convergence to specific abnormalities of cardiac structure and function may indicate vulnerability of specific cell types or developmental processes relevant for cardiogenesis. future studies would benefit from a controlled and standardized approach for cardiac evaluation in patients with sma.
heart_disease	capnography or end-tidal carbon dioxide (etco(2)) monitoring has a variety of uses in the pediatric intensive care setting. the ability to continuously measure exhaled carbon dioxide can provide vital information about airway, breathing, and circulation in critically ill pediatric patients. capnography has diagnosis-specific applications for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease, reactive airway disease, neurologic emergencies, and metabolic derangement. this modality allows for noninvasive monitoring and has become the standard of care. this article reviews the basic principles and clinical applications of etco(2) monitoring in the pediatric intensive care unit.
heart_disease	a novel series of vicinal diaryl azole-urea derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their potential to inhibit soat enzyme. among the reported compounds, compound (12d) emerged as the most potent compound with an ic50 value of 2.43 mu m. in polaxamer-407 induced lipoprotein lipase inhibition model, compound (12d) reduced triglyceride turnover in vivo. compound (12d) also showed dose-dependent prevention of serum total cholesterol and prevention of ldl-c elevation at a dose of 30 mg/kg. furthermore, compound (12d) showed potential to stop falling levels of serum hdl-c dose-dependently and improved the atherogenic index. effect of 12d on body weight, plaque formation and development of atherogenic lesions were studied. toxicological study of compound (12d) indicated that at a dose of 2000 mg/kg, 12d was devoid of any signs of toxicity or mortality.

heart_disease	background in patients referred for radiofrequency catheter ablation (rfca) of ventricular tachycardia (vt) in the setting of structural heart disease, early post-procedural mortality (em) has not been previously investigated. objectives the purpose of this study was to evaluate em after catheter ablation of scar-related vt. methods associations between clinical and procedural variables and em (within 31 days of the procedure) were tested in patients with structural heart disease undergoing rfca of vt at 12 international centers. results of 2,061 patients (mean age 62 +/- 13 years; left ventricular ejection fraction [lvef] 34 +/- 13%; 53% ischemic etiology), em occurred in 100 (5%; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4% to 6%). a total of 54 (3%) patients died before hospital discharge (median 9 days after the procedure; 25% for refractory vt), including 12 (0.6%) after a major procedure-related complication. in multivariable analysis, the following factors were found to be significantly associated with em: lvef (odds ratio [or] per percent decrease: 1.12; 95% ci: 1.05 to 1.20; p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (or: 2.73; 95% ci: 1.10 to 6.80; p = 0.030), presentation with vt storm (or: 3.61; 95% ci: 1.37 to 9.48; p = 0.009), and presence of unmappable vts (or: 5.69; 95% ci: 1.37 to 23.69; p = 0.017). recurrent vt was also associated with an increased risk of subsequent death (hazard ratio: 7.19; 95% ci: 5.57 to 9.28; p < 0.001) and em (hazard ratio: 11.45; 95% ci: 7.47 to 17.59; p < 0.001). conclusions in a contemporary cohort of patients with scar-related vt undergoing rfca, em occurred in 5% of cases. clinical and procedural variables indicating poorer clinical status (low lvef, chronic kidney disease, vt storm, and unmappable vts) and post-procedural vt recurrence may predict em. identification of such features may prompt early consideration for hemodynamic support or other care to help mitigate later potential complications.

heart_disease	background: high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays enable myocardial infarction to be ruled out earlier, but the optimal approach is uncertain. we compared the european society of cardiology rule-out pathway with a pathway that incorporates lower cardiac troponin concentrations to risk stratify patients. methods: patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (n=1218) underwent high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i measurement at presentation and 3 and 6 or 12 hours. we compared the european society of cardiology pathway (<99th centile at presentation or at 3 hours if symptoms <6 hours) with a pathway developed in the high-steacs study (high-sensitivity troponin in the evaluation of patients with acute coronary syndrome) population (<5 ng/l at presentation or change <3 ng/l and <99th centile at 3 hours). the primary outcome was a comparison of the negative predictive value of both pathways for index type 1 myocardial infarction or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. we evaluated the primary outcome in prespecified subgroups stratified by age, sex, time of symptom onset, and known ischemic heart disease. results: the primary outcome occurred in 15.7% (191 of 1218) patients. in those less than the 99th centile at presentation, the european society of cardiology pathway ruled out myocardial infarction in 28.1% (342 of 1218) and 78.9% (961 of 1218) at presentation and 3 hours, respectively, missing 18 index and two 30-day events (negative predictive value, 97.9%; 95% confidence interval, 96.9-98.7). the high-steacs pathway ruled out 40.7% (496 of 1218) and 74.2% (904 of 1218) at presentation and 3 hours, missing 2 index and two 30-day events (negative predictive value, 99.5%; 95% confidence interval, 99.0-99.9; p<0.001 for comparison). the negative predictive value of the high-steacs pathway was greater than the european society of cardiology pathway overall (p<0.001) and in all subgroups, including those presenting early or known to have ischemic heart disease. conclusions: use of the high-steacs pathway incorporating low high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations rules out myocardial infarction in more patients at presentation and misses 5-fold fewer index myocardial infarctions than guideline-approved pathways based exclusively on the 99th centile.
heart_disease	this study aimed at characterizing the fatty acid (fa) composition of red blood cell (rbc) phospholipids in children and adolescents with primary hyperlipidemia, and to ascertain potential association with serum lipid profile and dietary factors. at this purpose, 54 probands aged 6-17 years were recruited. subjects showed a low omega-3 index (eicosapentaenoic acid, epa+docosahexaenoic acid, dha < 4%). compared to males, females had a trend toward lower levels of total monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) and mufa/saturated fatty acids (sfas) ratio in rbcs. an inverse relationship between mufa concentration in rbcs and serum cholesterol or hdl-c/triglycerides ratio was found. omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 pufa) were positively associated to serum hdl-c levels, and inversely to dietary cholesterol. fiber intake was positively associated with mufa/sfa ratio. in conclusion, we provide the first experimental data on phospholipid fa composition of rbcs in hyperlipidemic children, showing sex differences and an overall low omega 3-index.
allergies	background: many placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that allergen immunotherapy (ait) is an effective therapy for treating allergies. both commonly used routes, subcutaneous (scit) and sublingual immunotherapy (slit), require high patient adherence to be successful. in the literature, numbers describing adherence vary widely; this investigation compares these two routes of therapy directly. methods: all data were retrieved from the patient data management system of a center for dermatology, specific allergology, and environmental medicine in germany. all 330 patients (aged 13-89 years) included in this study had commenced ait between 2003 and 2011, thus allowing a full 3-year ait cycle to be considered for each investigated patient. results: in this specific center, scit was prescribed to 62.7% and slit to 37.3% of all included patients. the total dropout rate of the whole patient cohort was 34.8%. overall, slit patients showed a higher dropout rate (39.0%) than did scit patients (32.4%); however, the difference between these groups was not significant. also, no significant difference between the overall dropout rates for men and for women was observed. a kaplan-meier curve of the patient collective showed a remarkably high dropout rate for the first year of therapy. conclusion: the analysis presented in this single-center study shows that most patients who discontinue ait do so during the first year of therapy. patients seem likely to finish the 3-year therapy cycle if they manage to adhere to treatment throughout the first year. strategies for preventing nonadherence in ait, therefore, need to be developed and standardized in future investigations.
allergies	background: multiple sclerosis (ms) and allergies are both considered to be related to imbalanced thl and th2 immune responses. previous studies evaluating the relationship between ms and allergies provide conflicting results. objective: to assess allergies and asthma as risk factors for ms and as predictors of ms relapses in a pediatric cohort. methods: the environment and genetic risk factors for pediatric ms study is a national case-control project with 16 participating us sites. an environmental questionnaire is used that includes history of allergies in the first five years of life. case-control data are entered in the pediatric ms network database and cases at 12 of the 16 sites enter relapse data prospectively. annualized relapse rate was calculated for patients with follow-up and adjusted for age at disease onset, gender, race, ethnicity, and use of disease-modifying therapy (dmt). results: we included 271 cases (mean age at disease onset of 15.7 years and 62% female) and 418 controls. relapse data were available for 193 cases. there was no difference in prevalence of allergies or asthma between cases and controls. patients with food allergies had fewer relapses compared to patients without food allergies (0.14 vs 0.48, p = 0.01). conclusions: while allergies and asthma are not associated with pediatric ms, cases with food allergies have fewer relapses compared to those without food allergies.

allergies	little is known about the health effects of school-related indoor dampness and microbial exposures. in this study, we investigated dampness and dampness-related agents in both homes and schools and their association with allergy and respiratory health effects in 330 danish pupils. classroom dampness was identified based on technical inspection and bedroom dampness on parents' self-report. classroom and bedroom dust was analyzed for seven microbial components. skin prick testing determined atopic sensitization. lung function was expressed as z-scores for forced expiratory volume in one-second (zfev(1)), forced vital capacity (zfvc) and the ratio zfev(1)/zfvc using gli-2012 prediction equations. the parents reported children 's allergies, airway symptoms, and doctor-diagnosed asthma. high classroom dampness, but not bedroom dampness, was negatively associated with zfev(1) (-coef. -0.71; 95% ci -1.17 to -0.23) and zfvc (-coef. -0.52; 95% ci -0.98 to -0.06) and positively with wheezing (or 8.09; 95% ci 1.49 to 43.97). no consistent findings were found between any individual microbial components or combination of microbial components and health outcomes. among other indoor risk factors, environmental tobacco smoke (ets) decreased zfev(1) (-coef. -0.22; 95% ci -0.42 to -0.02) and zfev(1)/zfvcratio (-coef. -0.26; 95% ci -0.44 to -0.07) and increased upper airway symptoms (or 1.66; 95% ci 1.03-2.66). in conclusion, dampness in classrooms may have adverse respiratory health effects in pupils, but microbial agents responsible for this effect remain unknown.
allergies	background: helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of more than half of the world 's population. there is increasing evidence h. pylori protects against the development of obesity and childhood asthma/allergies in which the development of these diseases coincide with transient dysbiosis. however, the mechanism underlying the association of h. pylori eradication with human metabolic and immunological disorders is not well-established. in this study, we aimed to investigate the local and systemic effects of h. pylon eradication through untargeted fecal lipidomics and plasma metabolomics approaches by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (lc-ms). results: our study revealed that eradication of h. pylori eradication (i.e.,loss of h. pylori and/or h. pylori eradication therapy) changed many global metabolite/lipid features, with the majority being down-regulated. our findings primarily show that h. pylori eradication affects the host energy and lipid metabolism which may eventually lead to the development of metabolic disorders. conclusion: these predictive metabolic signatures of metabolic and immunological disorders following h. pylori eradication can provide insights into dynamic local and systemic metabolism related to h. pylori eradication in modulating human health.
allergies	the avoidance of allergens and allergen-specific immunotherapy (ait) are the only curative treatments of allergic diseases. this requires identification of the offending allergens based on the clinical history and the results of allergy tests, but also on prior attempts to stabilize the disease with drugs. ait in polysensitized patients with severe allergic diseases which are difficult to control is a major challenge. we report the case of a 16-year-old girl with rhinitis and severe asthma attributed to mites (dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and dennatophagoides farinae), grass pollen and cat dander. the addition of omaluzimab to the pre-established optimal treatment helped to control the disease and allowed us to initiate sublingual immunotherapy (slit). slit was well tolerated during omaluzimab administration and also after the drug was discontinued, and the treatment led to complete control of her allergic disease (symptoms, respiratory function and immunoassays). several studies have shown that omalizumab increases tolerance to and efficacy of ait in patients with respiratory and hymenoptera venom allergies. however, in most studies, omalizumab treatment was maintained during ait. our results in this young polysensitized girl with severe asthma agree with results reported in other studies which showed that pretreatment with omalizumab could lead to better tolerance and efficacy of ait. moreover, it was also reported that ait can act synergistically with omalizumab and involves only the induction mechanisms of immune-regulation.

allergies	every fifth pregnant woman is affected by allergies, especially rhinitis and asthma. allergic symptoms existing before pregnancy may be either attenuated, or equally often promoted through pregnancy. optimal allergy and asthma diagnosis and management during pregnancy is vital to ensure the welfare of mother and baby. for allergy diagnosis in pregnancy, preferentially anamnestic investigation as well as in vitro testing should be applied, whereas skin testing or provocation tests should be postponed until after birth. pregnant women with confirmed allergy should avoid exposure to, or consumption of the offending allergen. allergen immunotherapy should not be initiated during pregnancy. in patients on immunotherapy since before pregnancy, maintenance treatment may be continued, but the allergen dose should not be increased further. applicable medications for asthma, rhinitis or skin symptoms in pregnancy are discussed and listed. in conclusion, i) allergies in pregnancy should preferentially be diagnosed in vitro; ii) ait may be continued, but not started, and symptomatic medications must be carefully selected; iii) management of asthma and allergic diseases is important during pregnancy for welfare of mother and child.
allergies	although the prevalence with which food causes asthma is not well known, food allergy is implicated in a variety of respiratory symptoms. eighty-two asthmatic children aged 6-16 years with doctor-diagnosed sensitization to inhalants and presenting with asthma exacerbation participated in this study of food allergies linked to asthma exacerbations. the diagnosis of food allergy was established using a questionnaire, clinical criteria, serum-specific ige antibody measurements, and an atopy patch test. asthma exacerbation was determined using fractional exhaled nitric oxide management after the children were admitted to the hospital. on the basis of questionnaire data, suspected food allergy was identified in 59.8% children. the positive and negative rates of serum food-specific ige tests were 54.9% and 45.1%, respectively. the results of atopy patch tests in radioallergosorbent-positive participants were 88.9% positive and 12.5% negative. food allergy is a risk factor for asthma exacerbation, and evaluation of food allergy in selected patients with asthma is indicated.
allergies	storage insects may cause occupational allergies in humans. the identification of the prevalence of ige reactions were measured from protein fractions prepared from multiple life stage of granary weevil sitophilus granarius [sg] is reported. sera of 30 patients from a suburban population of upper silesia (south poland) were tested for the presence of ige antibodies to antigens from larvae, pupae and adults of both sexes of the beetle. to identify protein fractions containing potential allergens, proteins collected from four life stages of granary weevil were fractionated by sds-page and probed with anti-human, anti-ige monoclonal antibodies. the proteins were fractionated by sds page and identified by western blot. the patients' antibodies against particular antigens were identified using anti-human anti-ige monoclonal antibody. the conducted immunological analysis showed the existence of many protein fractions for each life stage of sg which give positive reactions with ige antibodies. the largest number of allergenic potential fractions was shown in pupae (60 protein fractions) while the smallest amount was shown in larvae (44 protein fractions). summarizing, the obtained results suggest the existence of many protein fractions with an allergenic potential multiple life stages of sg. this indicates that all developmental stages of sg may be a serious source of antigens and potential risk factors for the exposed persons.

allergies	background: urinary incontinence is defined as a complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine. during pregnancy, the prevalence of urinary incontinence ranges from 32 to 64 %. different factors like demographic factors, obstetric factors, and other external factors affect urinary incontinence. in ethiopia, there is no study conducted so far on the magnitude of urinary incontinence and factors associated among pregnant women. the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence and associated factors among pregnant women following antenatal care at the university of gondar hospital. methods: institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 pregnant women following antenatal care at the university of gondar hospital. data was collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using spss version 20. descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. the results were considered significant at p-value < 0.05. result: the overall prevalence of urinary incontinence among the participants was 11.4 % [ 48]. after adjustment episiotomy, constipation, obese women, chronic cough/sneezing, asthma/allergies/sinusitis was associated with urinary incontinence. conclusions: in this study, a lower prevalence was found than that of previous studies. there was a significant association of urinary incontinence with a previous history of episiotomy, constipation, maternal bmi, and respiratory problems.
menopause	objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate associations between reproductive factors and survival to age 90 years. methods: this was a prospective study of postmenopausal women from the women 's health initiative recruited from 1993 to 1998 and followed until the last outcomes evaluation on august 29, 2014. participants included 16,251 women born on or before august 29, 1924 for whom survival to age 90 during follow-up was ascertained. women were classified as having survived to age 90 (exceptional longevity) or died before age 90. multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations of ages at menarche and menopause (natural or surgical) and reproductive lifespan with longevity, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive characteristics. results: participants were on average aged 74.7 years (range, 69-81 y) at baseline. of 16,251 women, 8,892 (55%) survived to age 90. women aged at least 12 years at menarche had modestly increased odds of longevity (odds ratio [or], 1.09; 95% ci, 1.00-1.19). there was a significant trend toward increased longevity for later age at menopause (natural or surgical; p-trend = 0.01), with ors (95% cis) of 1.19 (1.04-1.36) and 1.18 (1.02-1.36) for 50 to 54 and at least 55 compared with less than 40 years, respectively. later age at natural menopause as a separate exposure was also significantly associated with increased longevity (p-trend = 0.02). longer reproductive lifespan was significantly associated with increased longevity (p-trend = 0.008). the odds of longevity were 13% (or 1.13; 95% ci, 1.03-1.25) higher in women with more than 40 compared with less than 33 reproductive years. conclusions: reproductive characteristics were associated with late-age survival in older women.
menopause	due to its minimal systematic adverse effects, transdermal estrogen is widely used for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. the present meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effects of transdermal estrogen on bone mineral density (bmd) of postmenopausal women. studies were identified by searching electronic databases including cochrane library, medline, embase, and cinahl databases, and also the sciences citation index. systematic review of articles was published between january 1989 to february 2016. reference lists of the included articles were also evaluated and consultations were made with relevant experts. while 132 studies included the desired keywords, only nine clinical trials met the inclusion criteria and were finally reviewed. the pooled percent change in bmd was statistically significant in favor of transdermal estrogen. according to resulting pooled estimate, lumbar spine bmd one and two years after transdermal estrogen therapy was respectively 3.4% (95% ci: 1.7-5.1) and 3.7% (95% ci: 1.7-5.7) higher than the baseline values. the test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant based on the i-2 heterogeneity index. one-two years of transdermal estrogen delivery can effectively increase bmd and protect the bone structure in postmenopausal women.
menopause	age-associated changes in cardiac structure and function, together with estrogen loss, contribute to the progression of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in older women. to investigate the effects of aging and estrogen loss on the development of its precursor, asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, echocardiograms were performed in 10 middle-aged (20 months) and 30 old-aged (30 months) female fischer344xbrown-norway rats, 4 and 8 weeks after ovariectomy (ovx) and sham procedures (gonads left intact). the cardioprotective potential of administering chronic g1, the selective agonist to the new g-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (gper), was further evaluated in old rats (old-ovx+g1) versus age-matched, vehicle-treated ovx and gonadal intact rats. advanced age and estrogen loss led to decreases in myocardial relaxation and elevations in filling pressure, in part, due to reductions in phosphorylated phospholamban and increases in cardiac collagen deposition. eight weeks of g-protein-coupled estrogen receptor activation in old-ovx+g1 rats reversed the adverse effects of age and estrogen loss on myocardial relaxation through increases in sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase expression and reductions in interstitial fibrosis. these findings may explain the preponderance of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in older postmenopausal women and provide a promising, late-life therapeutic target to reverse or halt the progression of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
menopause	with an increase in the survival rate and shift in the age composition of women, menopause is emerging as one of the major health issues in the sociology of health. thanks to demographic transition, a sizeable number of women will now spend one-third to half of their life as post-menopausal. the present paper focuses upon the prevailing discourses on women 's menopausal health in the indian setting. it suggests that though women 's health beliefs, behaviour and coping patterns in the indian context differ from their western counterparts, huge similarities are found in sociocultural and medical discourses on menopause. in most of these discourses women are marginalised and seen as inferior to men. however, the epidemiological studies on women 's menopausal health in india suggest that menopause is a normal life event where menstruation ceases; it is not associated with the bio-psycho-social morbidity paradigm as prevalent in the west.
menopause	background: reduced bone formation is associated with increased bone marrow fat in many bone-loss related diseases including aging, post-menopause, and anorexia nervosa. several lines of evidence suggested the regulation of osteogenesis and adipogenesis of the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (skeletal) stem cells (bmscs) by paracrine mediators. this study aimed to investigate the impact of adipocytes-secreted factors on the cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of bmscs. methods: serum free conditioned medium (cm-adipo) was collected from stromal st2 cells-derived adipocytes. cell viability, quantitative alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity assay, alizarin red staining for matrix mineralization and osteogenic gene array expression were performed to determine the effect of cm-adipo on cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of primary murine bmscs (mbmscs). regulation of bmps and nf-kappa b signaling pathways by cm-adipo were detected by western blot analysis and gene reporter assay. results: cm-adipo showed no effect on cell viability/proliferation of primary mbmscs as compared to cm-control. on the other hand, cm-adipo significantly inhibited the commitment of mbmscs into osteoblastic cell lineage in dose-dependent manner. cm-adipo was found to dramatically inhibit the bmp2-induced osteoblast differentiation and to activate the inflammatory nf-kappa b signaling in mbmscs. interestingly, treatment of mbmscs with the selective inhibitor of nf-kappa b pathway, bay11-770682, showed to retrieve the inhibitory effect of cm-adipo on bmp2-induced osteoblast differentiation in mbmscs. conclusions: our data demonstrated that the marrow adipocytes exert paracrine inhibitory effect on the osteoblast differentiation of mbmscs by blocking bmps signaling in a mechanism mediated by adipokines-induced nf-kappa b pathway activation.
menopause	purpose we sought to evaluate patient adherence and response to simple vaginal and sexual health treatment strategies in female cancer patients receiving treatment at a female sexual medicine and health program and identify improvements of physical symptoms, per patient and clinical evaluation. method evaluability criteria included gynecologic exam at initial visit, at least one follow-up with gynecologic exam within 8 months of initial visit, and all consecutive follow-ups6.5 declined over time (p = 0.03). vas scores improved by last assessment (p < 0.001), as did vuas scores (p = 0.001). sexual function scores significantly improved (p < 0.001), confidence about future sexual activity increased (p = 0.004), and sexual/vaginal health concerns decreased (p = 0.00003). conclusion significant changes were observed in women using treatment strategies, with improvement in vulvovaginal symptoms, a decrease in elevated vaginal ph and pain with exams, enhanced sexual function, and increased intimacy confidence. implication these findings have high clinical relevance for symptom management with improvement of sexual function using simple strategies and clinical tools in the oncology setting.
menopause	background: reproductive and lifestyle factors influence both breast cancer risk and prognosis; this might be through breast cancer subtype. subtypes defined by immunohistochemical hormone receptor markers and gene expression signatures are used to predict prognosis of breast cancer patients based on their tumour biology. we investigated the association between established breast cancer risk factors and the 70-gene prognostication signature in breast cancer patients. patients and methods: standardised questionnaires were used to obtain information on established risk factors of breast cancer from the dutch patients of the mindact trial. clinical-pathological and genomic information were obtained from the trial database. logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between lifestyle risk factors and tumour prognostic subtypes, measured by the 70-gene mammaprint (r) signature (i.e. low-risk or high-risk tumours). results: of the 1555 breast cancer patients included, 910 had low-risk and 645 had high-risk tumours. current body mass index (bmi), age at menarche, age at first birth, age at menopause, hormonal contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapy use were not associated with manunaprint (r). in parous women, higher parity was associated with a lower risk (or: 0.75, [95% confidence interval {ci}: 0.59-0.95] p = 0.018) and longer breastfeeding duration with a higher risk (or: 1.03, [95% ci: 1.01-1.05] p = 0.005) of developing high-risk tumours; risk estimates were similar within oestrogen receptor positive disease. after stratifying by menopausal status, the associations remained present in post-menopausal women. conclusion: using prognostic gene expression profiles, we have indications that specific reproductive factors may be associated with prognostic tumour subtypes beyond hormone receptor status.

menopause	this policy paper intends to provide inputs for community health program development on high blood pressure (hbp) prevention and treatment improvement. the latest two consecutive national health surveys in 2010 and 2013 revealed deviant pattern of hbp among pre menopause females. earlier take-over of hbp prevalence is observed between females on males. exploration on hbp risk by age and sex was performed. the findings showed higher prevalence of hbp risk among females. age, obesity, emotional distress, and contraceptive use contribute to hbp occurrence. result of analysis was inconclusive to identify precise risk of earlier take over of high blood pressure. it could probably due to hormonal contraceptive use and higher prevalence of risk among females. since there was already higher health service utilization, it is recommended that the existing non communicable diseases (ncd) prevention and monitoring program is expanded to provide service for young females. among the service provided are motivation for healthy diet, physical activity, mental health service and family planning.
menopause	vaginal dryness and associated symptoms may occur in women of any age and are a frequent burden after menopause. the north american menopause society recommends long-acting non-hormonal vaginal creams as first-line therapy. a new type of such creams was developed (remifemina (r) feuchtcreme in austria and germany). this hormone-free cream contains hamamelis virginiana distillate and well-established vaginal cream ingredients. we explored its physical function and tolerability in an open interventional clinical trial. 20 postmenopausal women (54 to 76 years, median 60) treated their vaginal dryness using this cream once daily for 7 days and reported about their symptoms before, 4 to 8 h after first and 14 to 22 h after last application. a physician assessed tolerability and local physical function. all patients completed the study. local physical function significantly improved from dryness at baseline (mean 4.0 +/- sd 1.8) to a normal moisture level, on average (6.3 +/- 2.1 after first, 6.7 +/- 2.1 after last application, p = 0.0001). subjective assessment of a feeling vaginal dryness showed a significant improvement at both times (p = 0.0001). onset and duration of feeling moisturized were reported to be 0 to 2 min and 11.3 +/- 6.9 h after application. all women reported vaginal dryness at baseline. 55 and 80% of patients reported no dryness after first application and at the end of the investigation. the cream was seen at the application site for up to 21 h. tolerability assessments did not reveal any relevant change over time. there were four adverse events in 4 patients, all not serious and of mild intensity: urinary urgency (2), diarrhoea (1) and mild spotting after first application (1). the latter was caused by the dry surface of the applicator and was avoided by moisturizing the surface of the applicator at subsequent applications. in conclusion, these study results indicate a well-tolerated and long-acting function of this new vaginal moisturizing cream. further clinical research in more patients will follow.
menopause	objectives: in physiotherapeutic practice, special attention is being given to the reciprocal anatomical, physiological, and biomechanical relationship of the pelvis and the structures connected to it. however, the scientific literature shows mainly the theoretical information about their mutual connections. the lack of information about these relations from a practical aspect coupled with the paucity of scientific papers on the impact of posture changes on the pelvic floor led the authors to conduct this study. the primary aim of this study was to compare the resting and functional bioelectrical activities of pelvic floor muscles (pfms) depending on three different positions of the lower limbs (positions a, b, and c) in the supine position. materials and methods: this was a prospective observational study evaluating resting and functional activities of the pfm depending on the position of the lower limbs. the study was carried out at the department and clinic of urology, university hospital in wroclaw, poland and the target group were women in the menopausal period. bioelectrical activity of pfm was recorded using a surface electromyographic instrument in the supine position. results of the values obtained in a, b, and c positions were compared using a one-way analysis of variance. results: in position a, the average resting surface electromyography (semg) activity of pfm was 6.9 +/- 2.6 mu v; in position b, the result was 6.9 +/- 2.5 mu v and in position c, the resting semg activity was 5.7 +/- 1.8 mu v (p=0.0102). the results of the functional bioelectrical activity of pfm were as follows: position a - 20.3 +/- 11.8 mu v, position b - 19.9 +/- 10.6 mu v, and position c - 25.3 +/- 10.9 mu v (p=0.0104). conclusion: the results showed that in the supine position, the pfm achieved the lowest resting activity and the highest functional activity. therefore, the supine position can be recommended for the diagnosis and therapy of weakened pfm.
emergency_contraception	we present an overview of the current sexual behavior of adolescents in israel, including the related social and moral issues, and compare it to that in western countries. an important factor is the existence of liberal versus conservative views regarding the use of contraception and termination of pregnancy in these young subjects. we describe the current situation where in most cases the medical providers do not provide adequate contraceptive advice to adolescent girls, resulting ultimately in a high rate of unintended pregnancy. in our opinion, it is essential to make effective contraception more accessible to this vulnerable group.
emergency_contraception	interprofessional education (ipe) continues to gain traction worldwide. challenges integrating ipe into health profession programmes include finding convenient times, meeting spaces, and level-appropriate assignments for each profession. this article describes the implementation of a 21-month prospective cohort study pilot programme for the master of science in nursing family nurse practitioner (fnp) and doctor of pharmacy (pharmd) students at a private university in the united states. this ipe experience utilised a blended approach for the learning activities; these students had initial and final sessions where they met face-to-face, with asynchronous online activities between these two sessions. the online assignments, discussions, and quizzes during the pilot programme involved topics such as antimicrobial stewardship, hormone replacement therapy, human papilloma virus vaccination, prenatal counselling, emergency contraception, and effects of the affordable care act on practice. the results suggested that the fnp students held more favourable attitudes about online ipe and that the pharmd students reported having a clearer understanding of their own roles and those of the other participating healthcare students. however, the students also reported wanting more face-to-face interaction during their online ipe experience. implications from this study suggest that effective online ipe can be supported by ensuring educational parity between students regarding the various topics discussed and a consistent approach of the required involvement for all student groups is needed. in addition, given the students desire for more face-to-face interaction, it may be beneficial to offer online ipe activities for a shorter time period. it is anticipated that this study may inform other programmes that are exploring innovative approaches to provide ipe to promote effective collaboration in patient care.
emergency_contraception	background: prostaglandin e2 (pge2) is an essential intrafollicular regulator of ovulation. in contrast with the one-gene, one-protein concept for synthesis of peptide signaling molecules, production and metabolism of bioactive pge2 requires controlled expression of many proteins, correct subcellular localization of enzymes, coordinated pge2 synthesis and metabolism, and prostaglandin transport in and out of cells to facilitate pge2 action and degradation. elevated intrafollicular pge2 is required for successful ovulation, so disruption of pge2 synthesis, metabolism or transport may yield effective contraceptive strategies. methods: this review summarizes case reports and studies on ovulation inhibition in women and macaques treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitors published from 1987 to 2014. these findings are discussed in the context of studies describing levels of mrna, protein, and activity of prostaglandin synthesis and metabolic enzymes as well as prostaglandin transporters in ovarian cells. results: the ovulatory surge of lh regulates the expression of each component of the pge2 synthesis-metabolism-transport pathway within the ovulatory follicle. data from primary ovarian cells and cancer cell lines suggest that enzymes and transporters can cooperate to optimize bioactive pge2 levels. elevated intrafollicular pge2 mediates key ovulatory events including cumulus expansion, follicle rupture and oocyte release. inhibitors of the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (ptgs2) enzyme (also known as cyclooxygenase-2 or cox2) reduce ovulation rates in women. studies in macaques show that ptgs2 inhibitors can reduce the rates of cumulus expansion, oocyte release, follicle rupture, oocyte nuclear maturation and fertilization. a ptgs2 inhibitor reduced pregnancy rates in breeding macaques when administered to simulate emergency contraception. however, ptgs2 inhibition did not prevent pregnancy in monkeys when administered to simulate monthly contraceptive use. conclusion: ptgs2 inhibitors alone may be suitable for use as emergency contraceptives. however, drugs of this class are unlikely to be effective as monthly contraceptives. inhibitors of additional pge2 synthesis enzymes or modulation of pge2 metabolism or transport also hold potential for reducing follicular pge2 and preventing ovulation. approaches which target multiple components of the pge2 synthesis-metabolism-transport pathway may be required to effectively block ovulation and lead to the development of novel contraceptive options for women. therapies which target pge2 may also impact disorders of the uterus and could also have benefits for women 's health in addition to contraception.
emergency_contraception	study objective: using a qualitative method, the purpose of this study was to: (1) obtain information directly from the adolescents on their attitudes and knowledge regarding emergency contraception; and (2) investigate the presence of differences between male and female participants' attitudes and knowledge. design and participants: this study consisted of 24 single-sex focus groups with 160 adolescents (male = 46.3% (74 of 160); female = 53.7% (86 of 160)) aged 15-19 years conducted among high schools in 3 regions of italy. results: data were analyzed through thematic analysis taking into account gender differences and 2 main themes emerged. the first was labeled ""adolescents' attitudes toward emergency contraception"" and it was divided into 3 subthemes: you should be aware; it 's a life line; and everything but a child. the second theme was labeled ""adolescents' knowledge toward emergency contraception"" and it was divided into 3 subthemes: false myths; baseline information; and just take it. conclusion: italian adolescents believed it is important to prevent the risk of unprotected sex by using contraceptive methods and their motivation to use emergency contraception is related to critical attitudes toward the consequences of irresponsible/ineffective contraception. although adolescents have an awareness of emergency contraception, more comprehensive knowledge is needed. these findings can inform specific interventions aimed at educating adolescents in need of emergency contraception.
emergency_contraception	context: emergency contraception (ec) is use of drug or device to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse. unlike other regular methods of contraception which are taken prior to the sexual act, ec is used after the unprotected sex. aim: to assess the knowledge and attitude toward use of emergency contraceptives among medical students. setting and design: a cross-sectional questionnaire based study was conducted among all the medical students in the government medical college in north-west india. subjects and methods: a questionnaire seeking information on knowledge and attitude of undergraduate medical students was administered over a period of 4 weeks in the month of february and march 2014. statistical analysis: the data were entered in ms excel and expressed using percentages. chi-square test was used as a test of statistical significance. results: about 61.6% (247/401) of the participants were aware about the timing of use of ec. audio visual media (76.6%; 307/401) was the most common source of information for of these medical students. conclusions: the lack of appropriate in-depth knowledge of ec among future health care professional should alarm the medical teaching system as ec is the only method that can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive accident.
emergency_contraception	although the absolute risk of pregnancy is lower during the perimenopause due to decreased fertility and decreased coital frequency, unintended pregnancy occurs at ratios similar to those observed in young women, and pregnancies that do occur are at high risk for maternal complications and poor outcomes such as miscarriage or chromosomal abnormalities. therefore all premenopausal women should receive counselling that includes discussion of sexual habits and contraception during routine health care encounters. the majority of us women in this age group use permanent contraception, but other methods can be safe and effective and can have non-contraceptive benefits. no contraceptive method is contraindicated based on age alone. however, estrogen-containing methods should be reserved for women without cardiovascular or thrombotic risk factors. the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (lng-ius, mirena (r)) has particular benefits during perimenopause and is safe for use in nearly all women. the lng-ius is approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, a common concern during the perimenopause. a substantial literature supports the use of the lng-ius for endometrial protection during transition from contraception to hormone therapy, although this is off-label in the united states. reliable contraception should be used until menopause is confirmed either by cessation of menses for 2 years prior to age 50, for 1 year after age 50, or by two elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) values >= 20-30 iu/i while off hormonal methods for at least 2 weeks. sterility cannot be assumed until at least age 60 because spontaneous pregnancies have been reported in women up to age 59.

emergency_contraception	objective: to determine whether a 3-month contraceptive vaginal ring (cvr) delivering ulipristal acetate (upa) can inhibit ovulation in 90% of cycles. study design: this was a randomized dose-finding parallel group clinical trial. fifty-five healthy women with normal ovulation at baseline were randomized to receive a low-dose (1500 mu g/day) or a high-dose (2500 mu g/day) upa-cvr for two consecutive 12-week treatment periods, followed by a recovery cycle. a subgroup of women received levonorgestrel (lng) 1.5 mg orally twice (at the end of both 12-week ring periods) or once (at the end of the 24-week treatment). the primary outcome was ovulation suppression assessed by transvaginal ultrasound and hormone levels. secondary outcomes included endometrial safety and bleeding patterns. results: all subjects showed normal ovulation at baseline and recovery. ovulation suppression was seen in 81.8% (95% ci: 73.3%, 88.5%) and 86.1% (95% ci: 78.1%, 92%) of treatment cycles with low and high-dose, respectively. benign progesterone receptor modulator associated endometrial changes (paec) were seen during treatment; 78.8% at week 24, but resolved at recovery cycle. a few cases of heavy bleeding occurred near the end of the 24-week treatment, but a single dose of lng every 12 weeks reduced the increase in endometrial thickness during the second treatment period and prevented excessive bleeding. conclusion: the 3-month upa-cvr may become an effective long-acting, user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive. the greatest suppression of ovulation was seen with the 2500-mu g/day ring. implications: the 3-month cvr delivering upa 2500 mu g/day can become an effective user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive method. benign paec during treatment returns to normal after discontinuation. the prevention of occasional excessive withdrawal bleeding, either by a progestin or by using higher upa levels to increase follicle suppression may permit prolonged treatment.

emergency_contraception	a pilot study assessed whether clinicians at an urban college health center met the reproductive needs (emergency contraception and contraception) of students. physicians and nurse practitioners completed a 5-item survey about prescribing emergency contraception and contraception. clinician prescribing practices varied, which may have resulted in contraceptive needs (for some students) not being met in a timely manner. clinicians had different understandings of policies about prescribing contraceptives when on-call, when students called in, and for students who had graduated. education and policies about handling ec and contraception requests are necessary so that clinicians meet students' reproductive health needs.
emergency_contraception	background: emergency contraception has been known for several decades, and dedicated products have been on the market for close to 20 years. yet it is unclear whether women, particularly in low-resource countries, have access to this important second-chance method of contraception. objectives: to review relevant policies, regulations, and other factors related to access to emergency contraception worldwide. search strategy: a wide range of gray literature was reviewed, several specific studies were commissioned, and a number of online databases were searched. main results: several positive policies and regulations are in place: emergency contraception products are registered in the majority of countries around the world, listed in many countries' essential medicines lists, included in widely used guidance, and supported by most donors. yet analysis of demographic data shows that the majority of women in low-income countries have never heard of emergency contraception, and surveys find that many providers have negative attitudes toward providing emergency contraception. conclusions: despite more than a decade of concerted international and country-level efforts to ensure that women have access to emergency contraception, accessibility remains limited.

emergency_contraception	this article analyzes the problem of complicity in wrongdoing in the case of healthcare practitioners (and in particular roman catholic ones) who refuse to perform abortions, but who are nonetheless required to facilitate abortions by informing their patients about this option and by referring them to a willing colleague. although this solution is widely supported in the literature and is also widely represented in much legislation, the argument here is that it fails to both (1) safeguard the well-being of the patients, and (2) protect the moral integrity of healthcare practitioners. finally, the article proposes a new solution to this problem that is based on a desirable ratio of conscientious objectors to non-conscientious objectors in a hospital or in a given geographic area.
skin_care	background: exposure of human skin to solar ultraviolet a (uva) irradiation causes severe oxidative stress with damage to various cellular components and concomitant inflammation and carcinogenesis. objective: the aim of this study is to investigate the protective effect of acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid (akba) against uva radiation on human skin keratinocytes. methods: hacat cells were pretreated with akba followed by uva irradiation. radiation effects on cell morphology, cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) levels, and antioxidant enzymes were examined. results: akba reduces uva irradiation-induced cell viability loss, accompanied by a decreased production of uva-induced ros, decreased malondialdehyde, and increased superoxide dismutase expression. in addition, akba increased basal and uva-induced levels of nrf2 (nf-e2-related factor 2), the redox-sensitive factor, and its target genes nqo1 and heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1), whereas expression of the tran-scriptional repressor bach1 (btb and cnc homology 1) was reduced. furthermore, the cytoprotective effects of akba against uva-derived oxidative damage were accompanied by modulating expression of inflammatory mediators (i.e., cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-kappa b) and nox1. conclusions: akba protects skin cells from uva-induced damage by modulating inflammatory mediators and/or ros production. therefore, akba has potential in the development of skin care products.

skin_care	objective: lymphedema is one of the most debilitating outcomes of breast cancer treatment. we aimed to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients with and without lymphedema, to assess risk factors for lymphedema, and to evaluate treatment outcomes in lymphedema patients. materials and methods: demographic and clinical characteristics of 84 women with previous surgery for breast cancer who presented to the outpatient clinic between march 2014 and may 2015 were retrospectively extracted from patient records. results: upper extremity lymphedema was detected in 34 of 84 patients (40.5%). the mean age, body mass index, the number of positive lymph nodes and the number of patients with postoperative radiotherapy were significantly higher among patients with lymphedema than those without (p<0.05). educational level of patients with lymphedema was significantly lower than the other group (p<0.05). the correlation analysis revealed an association between age, educational level, body mass index, tumor stage, number of positive lymph nodes, postoperative radiotherapy and presence of lymphedema. postoperative radiotherapy was detected as the only independent risk factor by logistic regression analysis. fourteen out of 26 lymphedema patients were assigned to education, skin care, exercise and compression bandaging therapy. upper extremity volumes and volume differences were significantly improved after treatment. conclusion: advanced age, low educational level, obesity, tumor size, the number of positive lymph nodes and postoperative radiotherapy correlated with the development of lymphedema. within these factors, postoperative radiotherapy was detected as an independent risk factor for the development of lymphedema. patient education, skin care, exercise and compression bandage therapy are effective treatment options in breast cancer-related lymphedema.
skin_care	herpes zoster (hz) infection is a common condition in the elderly. immunosuppression involving cellular immunity favors its occurrence. the pain is the most frequent complications of hz. it occurs in about 30% of people aged over 70 years. the virological diagnosis of typical hz is not useful, and the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical data. skin care is essential to limit cutaneous damage. antiviral drugs will reduce the risk of postherpetic neuralgia, if they are early prescribed within 72 hours after the rash onset. analgesia is essential and should be conducted in relation evolution. vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the occurrence of hz complications in the elderly, in particular post-herpetic neuralgia.
skin_care	phytoene is a colorless carotenoid with increasing economic potential for skin care but with limited availability. the red yeast xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous which has previously been used as a production platform for carotenoids was engineered as a prototype for the yield of this carotene. phytoene was accumulated by prevention of its metabolization by desaturation in the carotenoid pathway. in a first step, the phytoene desaturase gene crtl was disrupted by insertion of a hygromycin-resistance gene. most of the resulting transformants were heterozygote for intact and inactivated crtl. upon re-cultivation of this orange transformants under selection pressure, white colonies homozygote for disrupted crtl were obtained. in contrast to reddish wild-type, the orange transformants contained colored carotenoids together with phytoene whereas the homozygote transformant synthesized phytoene exclusively. this targeted mutagenesis approach was first tested with the wild type and then applied to a high-yield carotenoid synthesizing x. dendrorhous mutant. in a second step, precursor supply for phytoene synthesis was enhanced by over-expression of the genes hmgr, crte and crtyb which encode limiting enzymes of the pathway. the combination of this engineering approaches resulted in a phytoene producing x dendrorhous strain which accumulated 7.5 mg/g dw in shaking cultures. finally, experimental small scale fermenter studies demonstrated continuous growth of this strain during fermentation and stable phytoene production without selection pressure. this fermenter culture contained the highest phytoene content ever reached by any organism with more than 10 mg/g dw.(c) 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.

(skillman, nj), part of an extensive tiered program to evaluate product safety. in the cit, test formulations were applied to the skin of adults (18-70 years) with no known skin disease or allergies, 3 times per week for 2 weeks using semi-occlusive clinical patches. preservatives were 1 of up to 16 components of test formulas, and included ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, diazolidinyl urea, 1,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2,4-dione, parabens, isothiazolinone, phenoxyethanol, sorbates, or benzoates. skin sites were scored after each patch removal using a 5-point scale, with 0 = no visible reaction and 4 = erythema, marked edema, or substantial vesiculation. scores were reported as percentage of maximal irritation score. data were analyzed from 1363 cit studies (over 45 000 subjects). there were no significant differences in percentage of maximal scores between formulas grouped by preservative types (p >.1). median score across the entire dataset was 0.44, with most formulas showing none or mild irritation. although seasonal variations were observed, no correlation was noted between score and preservative concentration. in conclusion, in a large, normal subject dataset, preservatives at typical in-use concentrations did not appear to contribute to skin irritation.
skin_care	clinical features of atopic dermatitis change with age as skin homeostatic mechanisms develop. in some cases, symptoms persist from childhood to adult. in early childhood, the characteristic features of this disease are eczema or exudative papules accompanied by itching. after childhood, lichenified dermatitis preceded by severe itching is the major skin manifestation. presumably, this difference in clinical symptoms between childhood and adulthood may derive from the age-specific physiological function of skin, such as maintenance of proper stratum corneum, secretion of lipids, and perspiration. the volume and composition of secreted lipids and sweat change with age; these changes affect water retention, skin surface ph, and the microbiome. these physiological activities do not follow a hierarchy, but instead are coordinated to harmonize the maintenance of skin homeostasis. thus, daily skin care based on the characteristic age-specific physiological function of skin should be considered to manage atopic dermatitis. the usage of moisturizers contributes to reduce skin dryness and the incidence of atopic dermatitis, and is recommended immediately after bathing. a water temperature of 38 to 40 degrees during bathing can be beneficial for barrier recovery, and gentle detergents or soap should be chosen if necessary. after exercise, excess sweat on the skin surface should be rinsed off. avoidance of perspiration-inducing activities is not necessary. high temperature and humidity on skin surface may cause the development of miliaria and subsequent anhidrosis. wearing hygroscopic and breathable underwear is recommended.
skin_care	background: rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with four distinct subtypes: erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular. purpose: to review the different kinds of management for all subtypes. methods: we divided rosacea management into three main categories: patient education, skin care, and pharmacological/ procedural interventions. results: flushing is better prevented rather than treated, by avoiding specific triggers, decreasing transepidermal water loss by moisturizers, and blocking ultraviolet light. nonselective beta-blockers and alpha(2)-adrenergic agonists decrease erythema and flushing. the topical a-adrenergic receptor agonist brimonidine tartrate 0.5% reduces persistent facial erythema. intradermal botulinum toxin injection is almost safe and effective for the erythema and flushing. flashlamp-pumped dye, potassium-titanyl-phosphate and pulsed-dye laser, and intense pulsed light are used for telangiectasias. metronidazole 1% and azelaic acid 15% cream reduce the severity of erythema. both systemic and topical remedies treat papulopustules. systemic remedies include metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline, clarithromycin and isotretinoin, while topical remedies are based on metronidazole 0.75%, azelaic acid 15 or 20%, sodium sulfacetamide, ivermectin 1%, permethrin 5%, and retinoid. ocular involvement can be treated with oral or topical antibacterial. rhinophyma can be corrected by dermatosurgical procedures, decortication, and various types of lasers. conclusion: there are many options for rosacea management. patients may have multiple subtypes, and each phase has its own treatment.

skin_care	ganoderma lucidum, a species of the basidiomycetes class, has been attracting international attention owing to its wide variety of biological activities and great potential as an ingredient in skin care cosmetics including ""skin-whitening"" products. however, there is little information available on its inhibitory effect against tyrosinase activity. therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the chemical composition of g. lucidum and its inhibitory effects on melanogenesis. we isolated the active compound from g. lucidum using ethanol extraction and ethyl acetate fractionation. in addition, we assayed its inhibitory effects on tyrosinase activity and melanin biosynthesis in b16f10 melanoma cells. in this study, we identified a bioactive compound, ganodermanondiol, which inhibits the activity and expression of cellular tyrosinase and the expression of tyrosinase-related protein-1 (trp-1), trp-2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (mitf), thereby decreasing melanin production. furthermore, ganodermanondiol also affected the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp)-dependent signaling pathway, which are involved in the melanogenesis of b16f10 melanoma cells. the finding that ganodermanondiol from g. lucidum exerts an inhibitory effect on tyrosinase will contribute to the use of this mushroom in the preparation of skin care products in the future.
skin_care	the popularity of wet wipes application continues to grow, because they are an important part of skin care for millions of people around the world. wet wipes may consist of lots of substances that can cause irritation of skin or allergy and subsequently, their composition is necessary to be identified. the aim of this study was to perform screening organic compounds in wet wipes by solid-phase microextraction (spme) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. screening was carried out by analysis of six samples of wet wipes. alcohols, esters, ketones, aldehydes, acids, aromatic compounds and terpenes were identified in the samples. among identified alcohols, methanol and phenoxyethanol that can cause allergy was identified. propylene glycol that can be referred to a group of preservatives was found out in 2 samples. derivatives of benzene as ethyl benzene, methylethyl benzene and butyl ethyl benzene were also observed almost in all samples. diethyl phthalate that is not prohibited to use in hygiene products was observed in one wet wipe sample. applied parameters of solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry can be used in future for development of quantitative methodology for particular compounds as phthalates, alkoxyalcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons and preservatives.
skin_care	ethnopharmacological relevance: the top flowering aerial parts of the hypericum species are traditionally used to prepare ointments to heal cuts and burns. sometimes even the fruits are used for these purposes. hypericum androsaemum l., commonly known as tutsan or shrubby st. john 's wort, is a mediterranean medicinal plant which has been traditionally used to prepare an ointment for treating cuts and wounds. aim of the study: to evaluate the extracts obtained from h. androsaemum red berries as functional ingredients for skin care formulations. materials and methods: the methanolic extract was obtained by soxhlet extraction while the aqueous extract was prepared by decoction; their composition was determined by hplc analysis. their biological activities were measured in terms of proliferation and migration of human fibroblasts, inhibition of collagenase activity, and immunomodulatory effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). in addition, we evaluated their photostability by uv spectroscopy and their protective effects against apph-induced hemolysis in red blood cells (rbc). results: the polar extracts contained significant amounts of shikimic (108,143.7-115,901.3 mg/kg) and chlorogenic acids (45,781.1-57,002.7 mg/kg). the main components of these extracts made an important contribution to a significant increase in human fibroblast migration. both extracts were also active as collagenase inhibitors, with the aqueous one showing a greater inhibitory capacity (ic50 value of 88.1 mu g/ml), similar to that of chlorogenic acid. the kinetic parameters determined for the enzymatic reaction revealed for both aqueous extract and chlorogenic acid an uncompetitive mechanism of inhibition. the methanolic extract showed important effects on pbmcs by modulating il-6. both extracts proved to be photostable in the uva/b range and protected rbc against peroxidation at low concentrations. conclusions: h. androsaemum red berries were proven to contain phytochemicals that improve skin regeneration, hence potentially employable in skin care formulations.
myelofibrosis	primary myelofibrosis (pmf) is a chronic philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a skewed megakaryopoiesis and an overproduction of proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators that lead to the development of bone marrow (bm) fibrosis. since we recently uncovered the upregulation of mir-34a-5p in pmf cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (hpcs), in order to elucidate its role in pmf pathogenesis here we unravelled the effects of mir-34a-5p overexpression in hpcs. we showed that enforced expression of mir-34a-5p partially constrains proliferation and favours the megakaryocyte and monocyte/macrophage commitment of hpcs. interestingly, we identified lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (lef1) and nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group a, member 2 (nr4a2) transcripts as mir-34a-5p-targets downregulated after mir-34a-5p overexpression in hpcs as well as in pmf cd34+ cells. remarkably, the knockdown of nr4a2 in hpcs mimicked the antiproliferative effects of mir-34a-5p overexpression, while the silencing of lef1 phenocopied the effects of mir-34a-5p overexpression on hpcs lineage choice, by favouring the megakaryocyte and monocyte/macrophage commitment. collectively our data unravel the role of mir-34a-5p in hpcs fate decision and suggest that the increased expression of mir-34a-5p in pmf hpcs could be important for the skewing of megakaryopoiesis and the production of monocytes, that are key players in bm fibrosis in pmf patients.
myelofibrosis	objectives: to standardize diagnostic investigations for myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) to increase homogeneity in patient care and to streamline diagnostic approaches in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. methods: the development of canadian expert consensus recommendations for the diagnosis of mpns began with a review of the following: clinical evidence, daily practice, existing treatment guidelines, and availability of diagnostic tools. each group member was assigned a specific topic, which they discussed with the entire group during several consensus meetings. results: this document provides the canadian mpn group 's recommendations, proposed diagnostic algorithms, and background evidence upon which decisions were made. conclusions: standardization of diagnostic investigations will increase homogeneity in patient care and provide a foundation for future clinical research in this rapidly evolving therapeutic area. streamlining diagnostic approaches in the most efficient and cost-effective manner will also result in significant cost saving for the health care system.
myelofibrosis	congenital rickets is the term given to fetus born with clinical features of rickets, but those born with biochemical evidence of rickets without obvious clinical features still can be considered occult congenital rickets. some of the affected babies with this disease have the intrauterine rachitic environment, but a calcium trans-placental pump prevents the fetus from having clinical features of rickets. they may present with hypocalcemia few days after birth or later with more florid features of rickets. congenital rickets cases born with florid features reported over the last 40 years are few and can be divided into two groups. the first due to severe maternal osteomalacia in which their bones were so decalcified to have enough calcium to be pumped to their fetus. another group in which newborn babies were hypocalcemic due to other maternal diseases as malabsorption, celiac disease, pre-eclampsia, and prematurity. all inherited rickets cases per se, or as part of other syndromes can be considered congenital rickets. most cases seen in our region are due to maternal vitamin d deficiency with symptoms becoming obvious when the infants are breastfed, or may present with hypocalcemic convulsions or craniotabes. this is a review of congenital rickets with the aim of shedding light on this potentially acute disease that needs more attention and awareness in the neonatal period to avoid rare serious complications as cardiomyopathy or myelofibrosis and the complications of hypocalcemic convulsions. congenital rickets cases seen simulate a tip of an ice-burg and its prevention is an important issue, especially with the tremendous urbanization with tall buildings living in sun-deprived flats as the commonest type of residence leading to the increasing incidence of maternal osteomalacia and rickets.
myelofibrosis	chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn) comprise a spectrum of clonal neoplastic disorders characterized by overproduction of terminally differentiated cells of the myeloid lineage. a common genetic basis for the bcr-abl-negative mpn disorders was elucidated in 2005 with the identification of the jak2v617f mutation in the majority of mpn patients. the discovery of jak2v617f had a dramatic impact on the diagnosis and treatment of mpn. testing for jak2 mutations is now included in the world health organization (who) criteria for the diagnosis of mpn, and in 2011 the oral jak2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib became the first food and drug administration (fda)-approved drug for the treatment of myelofibrosis. the drug is now also approved in europe and canada.
myelofibrosis	ruxolitinib is the only therapy with an approved indication for myelofibrosis (mf), a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with progressive bone marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. although the pivotal phase 3 comfort studies included only patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk mf, the us indication includes all patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease. data from recent nonrandomized studies confirm that the benefits of ruxolitinib established in the comfort studies in terms of spleen size reduction and symptom improvement also extend to patients with intermediate-1 risk mf, who tend to have less advanced disease than patients with higher-risk mf. given the disease-modifying potential of ruxolitinib therapy, timely initiation of ruxolitinib therapy may not only improve patients' current clinical status but also lead to better long-term outcomes. the decision of whether or when to initiate ruxolitinib treatment should be based on the expected benefit-risk ratio for each patient, specifically considering potential adverse effects.
myelofibrosis	introduction: myelofibrosis (mf) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with peripheral blood cytopenias, marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly systemic symptoms and evolution to a refractory form of acute myeloid leukemia. treatment with a jak1/2 inhibitor significantly improves the symptom burden and reduces the degree of splenomegaly. jak1/2 therapy, however, results in a modest prolongation of survival, but does not halt disease progression or reduce the risk of leukemic transformation. novel agents with the potential to alter the progressive disease course of mf are urgently needed. areas covered: the pre-clinical rationale for the use of the telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in patients with advanced mf and essential thrombocythemia (et) will be reviewed as well the results of the initial clinical trials with this agent. expert opinion: results from a single institution pilot study of imetelstat therapy have been reported and indicate a signal of activity. this approach appears to have the potential to reverse bone marrow histomorphologic abnormalities, induce molecular responses, and target the malignant hematopoietic stem cell population in mf patients. results from a randomized, multi-center, phase ii trial in mf are ongoing.
myelofibrosis	calreticulin (calr) and jak2-v617f gene mutations, which are major genetic mutations in patients with primary myelofibrosis (pmf) and essential thrombocythemia (et), exert different effects on the clinical features and outcomes of these diseases. we analyzed 88 and 9 patients with et and pmf, respectively, and determined the differences in the clinical characteristics of et patients with jak2-v617f compared with calr mutations. the frequency of the jak2-v617f and calr mutations were 64 and 22 %, respectively. patients with calr mutations were younger, had a lower white blood cell count, and had a lower rate of thrombotic events than patients with the jak2 mutation. the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (nap) score of 16 patients with calr mutations was significantly lower than the normal controls, which was mainly due to the high proportion of nap-negative neutrophils. this is the first report to show an association between calr mutations in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn) and the nap score. although the mechanism is unclear, the nap score could be a useful and reliable biochemical marker to discriminate the mutational status of mpn patients. further investigation is warranted to determine whether these characteristics contribute to the pathogenesis of mpn and the nap score.
myelofibrosis	janus kinases (jaks) and their gain-of-function mutants have been implicated in a range of oncological, inflammatory, and autoimmune conditions, which has sparked great research interest in the discovery and development of small-molecule jak inhibitors. two molecules are currently marketed as jak inhibitors, but due to the displayed side effects (owing to their suboptimal selectivities among the various jak subtypes) new jak inhibitors are still sought after. we present the results of an extensive virtual screening campaign based on a multi-step screening protocol involving ligand docking. the screening yielded five new, experimentally validated inhibitors of jak1 with 8-hydroxyquinoline as a novel hinge-binding scaffold. the compounds did not only display favorable potencies in a jak1(v658f)-driven cell-based assay but were also shown to be non-cytotoxic on rat liver cells.
myelofibrosis	backgroundpatients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis, are faced with oppressive symptom profiles that compromise daily functioning and quality of life. among these symptoms, sexuality-related symptoms have emerged as particularly prominent and largely unaddressed. in the current study, the authors evaluated how sexuality symptoms from mpn relate to other patient characteristics, disease features, treatments, and symptoms. methodsa total of 1971 patients with mpn (827 with essential thrombocythemia, 682 with polycythemia vera, 456 with myelofibrosis, and 6 classified as other) were prospectively evaluated and patient responses to the myeloproliferative neoplasm symptom assessment form (mpn-saf) and the european organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire core 30 (eortc-qlq c30) were collected, along with information regarding individual disease characteristics and laboratory data. sexuality scores were compared with an age-matched, healthy control population. resultsoverall, patients with mpn were found to have greater sexual dysfunction compared with the healthy population (mpn-saf score of 3.6 vs 2.0; p65 years and in those with cytopenias and transfusion requirements, and those receiving certain therapies such as immunomodulators or steroids. conclusionsthe results of the current study identify the topic of sexuality as a prominent issue for the mpn population, and this area would appear to benefit from additional investigation and management. cancer 2016;122:1888-96. (c) 2016 american cancer society. sexuality problems impact all domains of functionality, depression, microvascular symptoms, and overall quality of life among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. these problems correlate with patient age, the presence of cytopenias, transfusion requirements, and common therapies for myeloproliferative neoplasms. see also pages 1804-6.
myelofibrosis	the food and drug administration approval of ruxolitinib for treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera has changed the management of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. yet the impact of this therapy on risk of thrombosis, a major cause of morbidity and mortality among these patients, remains unknown. the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ruxolitinib on the risk of thrombosis among patients with polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. following identification of randomized controlled trials comparing ruxolitinib to standard care or placebo, rates of thrombosis, including venous and arterial thrombosis, were analyzed using fixed effects models. rates of thrombosis were significantly lower among patients treated with ruxolitinib [risk ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.23-0.88]. subgroup analysis of venous and arterial thrombosis demonstrated similar risk ratios, which did not reach statistical significance (risk ratio 0.46, 95% ci 0.14-1.48 and rr 0.42, 95% ci 0.18-1.01, respectively). in conclusion, our analysis suggests that jak2 inhibition with ruxolitinib decreases the risk of arterial and/or venous thrombosis in patients with polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. these findings will require confirmation in a prospective study. copyright (c) 2016 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
hypothyroidism	background: pregnancy strongly influences the thyroid gland and its function. thyroid guidelines recommend a 30 to 50% increase of the preconceptional levothyroxine dose in women with hypothyroidism, when pregnancy is diagnosed.case: a 33 year-old, 8-week pregnant woman with hypothyroidism, presents with a 2-week history of palpitations, sweating, nervousness and fatigue. physical examination shows tachycardia (108 bpm), distal tremors and diffuse goiter. after biochemical confirmation of hyperthyroidism, her levothyroxine dose is reduced and finally interrupted. propylthiouracil is started and maintained until after the delivery of a healthy baby at week 40. two weeks postpartum, hyperthyroidism worsens and propylthiouracil is replaced by methimazole. eighteen months after delivery 7.5mci 131iodine was given. two months later, hypothyroidism developed and levothyroxine was initiated.conclusion: although conversion of hashimoto 's hypothyroidism into graves' disease is exceptional in pregnancy, pregnant women with autoimmune hypothyroidism should ideally have their tsh concentrations measured before empirically increasing their levothyroxine dose.
hypothyroidism	sunitinib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) that targets various receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (vegfrs). sunitinib received approval in 2006 and became a standard treatment option in the first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer (mrcc) after a phase iii trial showed superiority compared with interferon alpha (ifn-alpha). sunitinib has also shown activity in second-line treatment in several trials. most of the combination trials with sunitinib with various agents have led to considerable toxicity without improving efficacy. sunitinib alone causes significant side effects and has a distinct profile with diarrhoea, hypertension, skin effects hypothyroidism, fatigue and nausea of special interest. the recommended dose of sunitinib in mrcc is 50 mg orally daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off treatment (4/2 schedule). an alternative 2 weeks on, 1 week off schedule (2/1 schedule) seems to be of similar efficacy and better tolerability and could be more widely used in the future. an intermittent treatment strategy with a stop in remission and re-induction after progression showed efficacy in smaller trials and is currently being evaluated in a phase iii trial. direct comparison of sunitinib with pazopanib in first-line treatment showed a similar efficacy for both tkis with a distinct toxicity profile. data from two phase ii trials showed that sunitinib has also activity in non-clear cell cancer and is an option due to a lack of better alternatives. currently, after immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown very promising results in the second-line treatment of rcc, they are being tested in a number of phase iii trials in the first-line setting. the future will show the position of sunitinib in the first-line treatment of rcc in the era of the immune checkpoint inhibitors.
hypothyroidism	introductionhypothyroidism is a common disorder, appearing mainly in women although less frequently found in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). the objective was to test the hypothesis that hyperandrogenism might protect against hypothyroidism. material and methodsthe data from three prospective follow-up studies (up to 21years) and one register study were compared: women with pcos (rotterdam criteria), n=25, women with turner syndrome, n=217, a random population sample of women, n=315, and men, n=95 (the who monica study). findings were to be verified or rejected in all females, n=553 716, from the same region. the proportion of hypothyroidism was calculated and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (tpo) in serum were measured. resultshypothyroidism at >50years of age was found in 8% of women with pcos, 4% in men (pcos vs. men; ns), 43% of women with turner syndrome, irrespective of karyotype (p<0.001 vs. pcos), and in 17% of postmenopausal women in the population (p25years (5.5%) than in women without pcos (6.8%) from the same region (p<0.01). conclusionshypothyroidism was less frequently seen in women with pcos and in men compared with women in the general population and among women with turner syndrome. this was not explained by altered autoimmunity or the y-chromosome. androgens seem to protect against hypothyroidism.
hypothyroidism	objectivesthe aim of this study was to identify systemic and local risk indicators associated with peri-implantitis. material and methodsone hundred eighty-three patients treated with 916 osseointegrated titanium implants, in function for at least 1year, were included in the present study. the implants were installed at the foundation for scientific and technological development of dentistry (fundecto) - university of sao paulo (usp) - from 1998 to 2012. factors related to patient 's systemic conditions (heart disorders, hypertension, smoking habits, alcoholism, liver disorders, hepatitis, gastrointestinal disease, diabetes mellitus i and ii, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, menopause, osteoporosis, active periodontal disease, history of periodontal disease and bruxism), implant 's characteristics (location, diameter, length, connection, shape, and antagonist), and clinical parameters (wear facets, periodontal status on the adjacent tooth, plaque accumulation on the adjacent tooth, modified plaque index, sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, bleeding on probing, width of keratinized tissue and marginal recession). resultsan increased risk of 2.2 times for history of periodontal disease (pd), 3.6 times for cemented restorations compared to screw-retained prostheses, 2.4 times when wear facets were displayed on the prosthetic crown and 16.1 times for total rehabilitations when compared to single rehabilitations were found. logistic regression analysis did not show any association between the implant 's characteristics and peri-implantitis. conclusionsa history of periodontal disease, cemented prostheses, presences of wear facets on the prosthetic crown and full mouth rehabilitations were identified as risk indicators for peri-implantitis. implants' characteristics were not related to the presence of peri-implantitis.
hypothyroidism	diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) is the most common type of non-hodgkin lymphoma and comprises approximately 30% of all lymphomas. patients typically present with a nonpainful mass in the neck, groin, or abdomen associated with constitutional symptoms. in this report, however, the authors describe a rare case of a 61-year-old woman with hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly (elevation of insulin-like growth factor-1 [igf-1]) with elevated growth hormone releasing hormone (ghrh) in whom an mri demonstrated diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland. despite medical treatment, the patient had persistent elevation of igf-1. she underwent a transsphenoidal biopsy, which yielded a diagnosis of dlbcl with an activated b-cell immunophenotype with somatotroph hyperplasia. after stereo tactic radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy, she is currently in remission from her lymphoma and has normalized igf-1 levels without medical therapy, 8 months after her histopathological diagnosis. this is the only reported case of its kind and displays the importance of a broad differential diagnosis, multidisciplinary evaluation, and critical intraoperative decision-making when treating atypical sellar lesions.
hypothyroidism	background: programmed cell death protein-1 (pd-1) blockade therapies have demonstrated durable responses and prolonged survival in a variety of malignancies. treatment is generally well tolerated although immune-related adverse events (iraes) can occur. autoimmune thyroid dysfunction is among the most common irae, but an assessment of the clinical, mechanistic, and immunologic features has not been previously described. patient and methods: patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) treated with pembrolizumab at memorial sloan kettering cancer center (n = 51) as part of keynote-001 (nct01295827) were included. thyroid function test and antithyroid antibodies were assessed prospectively at each study visit, beginning before the first treatment. frequency of development of thyroid dysfunction, association with anti-thyroid antibodies, clinical course, and relationship with progression-free survival and overall survival to treatment with pembrolizumab was evaluated. results: of 51 patients treated, 3 were hypothyroid and 48 were not at baseline. ten of 48 [21%, 95% confidence interval (ci) 10% to 35%] patients developed thyroid dysfunction requiring thyroid replacement. anti-thyroid antibodies were present in 8 of 10 patients who developed thyroid dysfunction, compared with 3 of 38 who did not (80% versus 8%, p<0.0001). thyroid dysfunction occurred early (median, 42 days) in the pembrolizumab course, and a majority (6 of 10 patients) experienced brief, transient hyperthyroidism preceding the onset of hypothyroidism; no persistent hyperthyroidism occurred. both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were largely asymptomatic. overall survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in subjects who developed thyroid dysfunction (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% ci 0.09-0.94; p = 0.04). conclusions: thyroid dysfunction during pembrolizumab treatment of nsclc is common and is characterized by early-onset, frequently preceded by transient hyperthyroidism, closely associated with anti-thyroid antibodies, and may be associated with improved outcomes. the presence of antibody-mediated toxicity in t-cell-directed therapy suggests an under-recognized impact of pd-1 biology in modulating humoral immunity.
hypothyroidism	we report the case of a 49-year-old female patient with hypothyroidism who underwent bariatric surgery and developed severe hypothyroidism despite high doses of oral levothyroxine (l-t4) tablets. initially, a high-dose l-t4 tablets absorption test was performed to exclude pseudo-malabsorption. in view of a modest increase in serum t4 levels, l-t4 liquid formulation absorption test was performed, and showed faster and more efficient absorption of thyroid hormones. we discuss the issue of distinguishing malabsorption from pseudo-malabsorption, review the literature concerning the benefits of liquid l-t4 in cases of impaired absorption such as bariatric surgery and consider the socio-economic implications of different liquid formulations.
hypothyroidism	objective: thyroid abnormalities are common in obese children. the aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (sh)and to determine how circulating thyroid hormone concentrations correlate with anthropometrics in danish lean and obese children and adolescents. methods: in this cross-sectional study, we included 3006 children and adolescents, aged 6-18 years, from the registry of the danish childhood obesity biobank. the overweight/obese group (n= 1796) consisted of study participants with a body mass index (bmi) standard deviation score (sds) >= 1.28. the control group (n= 1210) comprised lean children with a bmi sds < 1.28. all participants were characterized by anthropometrics (weight, height, and waist circumference) and fasting serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine (ft(4)) at baseline. results: the prevalence of sh was higher among overweight/obese compared to lean study participants (10.4% vs. 6.4%, p=0.0001). in the overweight/obese group, fasting serum tsh concentrations were associated positively with bmi sds (p<0.0001) and waistheight ratio (whtr) (p0.5 (p= 0.0003). conclusion: the prevalence of sh was higher among overweight/obese study participants. the positive correlations of circulating tsh and ft 4 with whtr suggest that central obesity, independent of the overall degree of obesity, augments the risk of concurrent thyroid abnormalities in children and adolescents with obesity.
hypothyroidism	background metformin decreases serum levels of monomeric prolactin. no previous study has investigated the effect of metformin on macroprolactin content in patients with macroprolactinemia. methods we studied three age-, sex- and weight-matched groups of patients: 15 women with monomeric prolactin, 12 women with macroprolactin, as well as 15 women with normal prolactin levels. because of coexisting 2 diabetes or prediabetes all patients were treated with metformin (1.7-3 g daily). plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers, as well as serum levels of prolactin and macroprolactin were assessed at baseline and after 4 months of metformin treatment. results as expected, metformin reduced plasma glucose and triglycerides, as well as improved insulin sensitivity in all treatment groups. moreover, the drug reduced post-polyethylene glycol prolactin levels and tended to reduce pre-polyethylene glycol prolactin levels in women with monomeric prolactin but not in women with macroprolactinemia and women with normal prolactin levels. conclusion the obtained results indicate that metformin has a negligible effect on macroprolactin levels.
hypothyroidism	background/aims esophageal dysmotility is associated with gastrointestinal dysmotility in various systemic and neuroregulatory disorders. hypothyroidism has been reported to be associated with impaired motor function in esophagus due to accumulation of glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid in its soft tissues, leading to changes in various contraction and relaxation parameters of esophagus, particularly in the lower esophageal sphincter. in this study we evaluated esophageal transit times in patients of primary hypothyroidism using the technique of radionuclide esophageal transit scintigraphy. methods thirty-one patients of primary hypothyroidism and 15 euthyroid healthy controls were evaluated for esophageal transit time using 1520 mbq of technetium-99m sulfur colloid diluted in 10-15 ml of drinking water. time activity curve was generated for each study and esophageal transit time was calculated as time taken for clearance of 90% radioactive bolus from the region of interest encompassing the esophagus. esophageal transit time of more than 10 seconds was considered as prolonged. results patients of primary hypothyroidism had a significantly increased mean esophageal transit time of 19.35 +/- 20.02 seconds in comparison to the mean time of 8.25 +/- 1.71 seconds in healthy controls (p < 0.05). esophageal transit time improved and in some patients even normalized after treatment with thyroxine. a positive correlation (r = 0.39, p < 0.05) albeit weak existed between the serum thyroid stimulating hormone and the observed esophageal transit time. conclusions a significant number of patients with primary hypothyroidism may have subclinical esophageal dysmotility with prolonged esophageal transit time which can be reversible by thyroxine treatment. prolonged esophageal transit time in primary hypothyroidism may correlate with serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels.
headache	purpose of review although chronic migraine (cm) is a common disorder that severely impacts patient functioning and quality of life, it is usually underdiagnosed, and treatment responses often remain poor even after diagnosis. in addition, effective treatment options are limited due to the rarity of randomized controlled trials (rcts) involving patients with cm. in the present review, we discuss updated pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and neurostimulation treatment options for cm. recent findings pharmacological treatments include both acute and preventive measures. while acute treatment options are similar between cm and episodic migraine (em), preventive treatment with topiramate and botulinum toxin a exhibited efficacy in more than two rcts. in addition, several studies have revealed that behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques are associated with significant improvements in symptoms. thus, these treatment options are recommended for patients with cm, especially for refractory cases. neurostimulation procedures, such as occipital stimulation, supraorbital transcutaneous stimulation, non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation, have shown promising results in the treatment of cm. however, current studies on neurostimulation suffer from small sample size, no replication, or negative results. summary although cm is less responsive to treatment compared to em, recent advance in pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and neurostimulation treatments may provide more chance for successful treatment of cm.
headache	calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (cgrp mabs) have shown promise in the preventive treatment of migraine. therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cgrp mabs for preventive treatment of migraine. database including ovid-sp, cochrane library, pubmed and web of science (isi) were systematically searched up to april 2, 2016 for randomized controlled trials(rcts) which were dealing with the efficacy and safety of cgrp mabs for preventive treatment of episodic migraine. cochrane collaboration 's tool for assessing risk of bias was utilized for evaluating the bias and quality of rcts. the data was analyzed by reviewer manager 5.2. totally, 4 literatures matched the inclusion criteria, including 4 independent rcts and 1198 patients. among mentioned above, amg334 is a monoclonal antibody against cgrp receptor, but ald403, ly2951742 and tev-48125 are monoclonal antibody against cgrp. we found that 7 mg and 21 mg amg334 could n't reduce the monthly migraine days from baseline to week 1-4/9-12. but 70 mg amg334 could reduce the monthly migraine days from baseline to week 9-12 (md = -1.1, 95% ci=[-2.1,-0.21; p=0.021) significantly, as compared with placebo. meanwhile, after pooled estimate the efficacy of cgrp mab against cgrp, we found that cgrp mabs improved the decrease of monthly migraine days from baseline to week 1-4, as compared with placebo (wmd =1.62, 95% ci = [1.09,2.14], i-2 = 0%, p<0.00001). and cgrp mabs improved the decrease of monthly migraine days from baseline to week 9-12, no matter in single dose subgroup (wmd = 1.83, 95%ci = [0.06,3.601,i-2= 69%,p=0.04) or in multiple doses subgroup (wmd = 1.77, 95%ci = [0.40,3.141,i-2 = 61%,p=0.01). and there were no difference in incidence of adverse events between cgrp mab group and placebo group. in conclusion, cgrp mabs was a safety and effective preventive treatment for episodic migraine.

headache	cluster headache (ch) is a rare underdiagnosed primary headache disorder with very severe unilateral pain and autonomic symptoms. clinical characteristics of korean patients with ch have not yet been reported. we analyzed the clinical features of ch patients from 11 university hospitals in korea. among a total of 200 patients with ch, only 1 patient had chronic ch. the average age of ch patients was 38.1 +/- 8.9 years (range 19-60 years) and the average age of onset was 30.7 +/- 10.3 years (range 10-57 years). the male-to-female ratio was 7: 1 (2.9: 1 among teen-onset and 11.7: 1 among twenties-onset). pain was very severe at 9.3 +/- 1.0 on the visual analogue scale. the average duration of each attack was 100.6 +/- 55.6 minutes and a bout of ch lasted 6.5 +/- 4.5 weeks. autonomic symptoms were present in 93.5% and restlessness or agitation was present in 43.5% of patients. patients suffered 3.0 +/- 3.5 (range 1-25) bouts over 7.3 +/- 6.7 (range 1-30) years. diurnal periodicity and season propensity were present in 68.5% and 44.0% of patients, respectively. there were no sex differences in associated symptoms or diurnal and seasonal periodicity. korean ch patients had a high male-to-female ratio, relatively short bout duration, and low proportion of chronic ch, unlike ch patients in western countries.
headache	mild traumatic brain injury (mtbi) can produce somatic symptoms such as headache, dizziness, fatigue, sleep disturbances and sensorimotor dysfunction. sensorimotor function can be measured by tests such as the acoustic startle reflex (asr), an evolutionarily conserved defensive response to a brief yet sharp acoustic stimulus. mtbi produces a long-lasting suppression of asr in rodents and humans; however, the mechanism of this suppression is unknown. the present study examined whether inflammatory processes in the brainstem (particularly the caudal pontine reticular nucleus, pnc) could account for the suppression of asr after mtbi, because the pnc is an essential nucleus of the asr circuit. furthermore, while inflammation after mtbi is commonly observed in brain regions proximal to the site of impact (cortex and hippocampus), the effects of mtbi in brainstem structures remains largely understudied. the present study demonstrated a suppression of asr one day after injury and lasting at least three weeks after an mtbi, replicating previous findings. within the pnc, transient elevations of il-1 beta and tnf-alpha mrna were observed at one day after injury, while il-1 alpha mrna exhibited a delayed increase at three weeks after injury. reactive gliosis (via iba-1-ir for microglia and gfap-ir for astrocytes) were also observed in the pnc, at one day and seven days after injury, respectively. finally, the number of giant neurons (the major functional cell population in the pnc) was decreased three weeks after injury. the results indicate that glial activation precedes neuronal loss in the pnc, and correlates with the behavioral suppression of the asr. the results also raise implications for brainstem involvement in the development of post traumatic symptoms.

headache	background: dfn-02 is a novel intranasal spray formulation composed of sumatriptan 10 mg and a permeation-enhancing excipient comprised of 0.2% 1-o-n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltopyranoside (ddm). this composition of dfn-02 allows sumatriptan to be rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation and exhibit pharmacokinetics comparable to subcutaneously administered sumatriptan. rapid rate of absorption is suggested to be important for optimal efficacy. the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dfn-02 (10 mg) in the acute treatment of episodic migraine with and without aura over a 6-month period based on the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and the evaluation of results of clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, and electrocardiograms. methods: this was a multi-center, open-label, repeat-dose safety study in adults with episodic migraine with and without aura. subjects diagnosed with migraine with or without aura according to the criteria set forth in the international classification of headache disorders, 2nd edition, who experienced 2 to 6 attacks per month with fewer than 15 headache days per month and at least 48 headache-free hours between attacks, used dfn-02 to treat their migraine attacks acutely over the course of 6 months. results: a total of 173 subjects was enrolled, 167 (96.5%) subjects used at least 1 dose of study medication and were evaluable for safety, and 134 (77.5%) subjects completed the 6-month study. a total of 2211 migraine attacks was reported, and 3292 doses of dfn-02 were administered; mean per subject monthly use of dfn-02 was 3.6 doses. adverse events were those expected for triptans, as well as for nasally administered compounds. no new safety signals emerged. dysgeusia and application site pain were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events over 6 months (21% and 30.5%, respectively). most of the treatment-emergent adverse events were mild. there were 5 serious adverse events, all considered unrelated to the study medication; the early discontinuation rate was 22.5% over the 6-month treatment period. conclusion: dfn-02 was shown to be well tolerated when used over 6 months to treat episodic migraine acutely.
headache	objective: previous studies have demonstrated the presence of active trigger points (trps) in women with migraine reproducing their headache attacks. no study has investigated whether these trps can alter cervical muscle function in migraine. our objective was to analyze differences in the activation of superficial neck flexor and extensor muscles in women with migraine considering the presence of active trps in the splenius capitis (sc), the upper trapezius (ut), and the sternocleidomastoid (scm) muscles. methods: surface electromyography (emg) was recorded from the superficial flexors (scm and anterior scalene) and the extensor (sc, ut) muscles bilaterally as participants performed a staged task of cranio-cervical flexion (ccf; 5 contractions representing a progressive increase in ccf range of motion) in 70 women with migraine. they were stratified according to the presence or the absence of active trps in the scm, the sc, or the ut musculature. a comparison of emg normalized root mean square (rms) values was conducted with a 2 x 5 analysis of covariance with the task level as the within-subject variable, group stratified by active trps as the between-subjects variable and the presence of neck pain as a covariable. results: all patients exhibited active trps in their cervical muscles, which reproduced their migraine. women with migraine exhibiting active trps in the scm (p<0.01), the ut (p<0.05), or the sc (p<0.05) muscles had lower normalized rms values of their superficial neck flexors than those without active trps in the same muscles. in addition, individuals exhibiting active trps in the sc and the ut (both, p<0.05) muscles had higher normalized rms values in the sc muscle than those without active trps in the same muscles. conclusions: the presence of active trps in the cervical musculature determines an altered activation of superficial neck and extensor muscles during low-load, isometric ccf contractions in women with migraine.
headache	observational studies suggest that closure of a patent foramen ovale for other indications may reduce or even eliminate migraine attacks, particularly migraine with aura. the first randomized clinical trial of patent foramen ovale (pfo) closure for prevention of migraine, the mist trial, showed negative results. the results of the other two completed studies in this area have recently been published in the last year. prima and premium were also both negative for their primary endpoints. the premium trial did show a reduction in headache days in the migraine with aura subgroup but the final results of this subset analysis have not been published. there may be an as yet undetermined subgroup of patients with migraine who would benefit from closure, but slow recruitment has been a barrier to further study. several potentially life-threatening procedure-related adverse events occurred in the clinical trials. at this time, we recommend against offering pfo closure as a preventive treatment for migraine. based on available observational data, patients for whom pfo closure is indicated for other reasons may see some improvement in their migraines.
headache	objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of the emergency department observation unit (edou) for neurologically intact children with closed head injuries (chis) and computed tomography (ct) abnormalities. methods: a retrospective cohort study of children aged 0 to 18 years with acute chi, abnormal head ct, and a glasgow coma scales score of 14 or higher admitted to the edou of a tertiary care children 's hospital from 2007 to 2010. children with multisystem trauma, nonaccidental trauma, and previous neurosurgical or coagulopathic conditions were excluded. medical records were abstracted for demographic, clinical, and radiographic findings. poor outcome was defined as death, intensive care unit admission, or medically/surgically treated increased intracranial pressure. results: two hundred two children were included. median (range) age was 14(4 days-16 years) months; 51% were male. the most common ct findings were nondisplaced (136, 67%) or displaced (46, 23%) as well as skull fractures and subdural hematomas (38, 19%); 54 (27%) had less than 1 ct finding. the most common interventions included repeat ct (42, 21%), antiemetics (26, 13%), and pain medication (29, 14%). eighty-nine percentwere discharged in less than 24 hours. inpatient admission from the edou occurred in 6 (3%); all were discharged in less than 3 days. one patient required additional intervention (corticosteroid therapy). she had a subdural hematoma, persistent vomiting, intractable headache, and a nonevolving ct. conclusions: neurologically intact patients on initial ed evaluation had a very low likelihood of requiring further interventions, irrespective of ct findings. although prospective evidence is necessary, this supports reliance on clinical findings when evaluating a well-appearing child with an acute chi.
headache	background: it has been hypothesized that a constitutionally narrow cavernous sinus might predispose individuals to cluster headache. cavernous sinus dimensions, however, have never been assessed. methods: in this case-control study, we measured the dimensions of the cavernous sinus, skull base, internal carotid and pituitary gland with high-resolution t2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in 25 episodic, 24 chronic and 13 probable cluster headache patients, 8 chronic paroxysmal hemicrania patients and 22 headache-free controls. dimensions were compared between groups, correcting for age, sex and transcranial diameter. results: on qualitative inspection, no relevant pathology or anatomic variants that were previously associated with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicranias were observed in the cavernous sinus or paracavernous structures. the left-to-right transcranial diameter at the temporal fossa level (mean +/- sd) was larger in the headache groups (episodic cluster headache: 147.5 +/- 7.3 mm, p = 0.044; chronic cluster headache: 150.2 +/- 7.3 mm, p< 0.001; probable cluster headache: 146.0 +/- 5.3 mm, p = 0.012; and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania: 145.2 +/- 9.4 mm, p = 0.044) compared with controls (140.2 +/- 8.0 mm). after adjusting for transcranial diameter and correcting for multiple comparisons, there were no differences in the dimensions of the cavernous sinus and surrounding structures between headache patients and controls. conclusion: patients with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicrania had wider skulls than headache-free controls, but the proportional dimensions of the cavernous sinus were similar.
headache	carbon monoxide (co) poisoning affects 50,000 people a year in the united states. the clinical presentation runs a spectrum, ranging from headache and dizziness to coma and death, with a mortality rate ranging from 1 to 3%. a significant number of patients who survive co poisoning suffer from long-term neurological and affective sequelae. the neurologic deficits do not necessarily correlate with blood co levels but likely result from the pleiotropic effects of co on cellular mitochondrial respiration, cellular energy utilization, inflammation, and free radical generation, especially in the brain and heart. long-term neurocognitive deficits occur in 15-40% of patients, whereas approximately one-third of moderate to severely poisoned patients exhibit cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmia, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and myocardial infarction. imaging studies reveal cerebral white matter hyperintensities, with delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy or diffuse brain atrophy. management of these patients requires the identification of accompanying drug ingestions, especially in the setting of intentional poisoning, fire-related toxic gas exposures, and inhalational injuries. conventional therapy is limited to normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen, with no available antidotal therapy. although hyperbaric oxygen significantly reduces the permanent neurological and affective effects of co poisoning, a portion of survivors still have substantial morbidity. there has been some early success in therapies targeting the downstream inflammatory and oxidative effects of co poisoning. new methods to directly target the toxic effect of co, such as co scavenging agents, are currently under development.
overactive_bladder	background: lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) in men are a common clinical problem in urology and have been historically strictly linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph), which may lead to bladder outlet obstruction (boo). new molecules have been approved and have entered the urologists' armamentarium, targeting new signaling pathways and tackling specific aspects of luts. objective of this review is to summarize the evidence regarding the new medical therapies currently available for male non-neurogenic luts, including superselective a1-antagonists, pde-5 inhibitors, anticholinergic drugs and intraprostatic onabotulinum toxin injections. methods: the national library of medicine database was searched for relevant articles published between january 2006 and december 2015, including the combination of ""bph"", ""luts"", ""medical"" and ""new"". each article 's title, abstract and text were reviewed for their appropriateness and their relevance. one hundred forty eight articles were reviewed. results: of the 148 articles reviewed, 92 were excluded. silodosin may be considered a valid alternative to nonselective alpha 1-antagonists, especially in the older patients where blood pressure alterations may determine major clinical problems and ejaculatory alterations may be not truly bothersome. tadalafil 5 mg causes a significant decrease of ipss score with an amelioration of patients' qol, although with no significant increase in q(max). antimuscarinic drugs are effective on storage symptoms but should be used with caution in patients with elevated post-void residual. intraprostatic injections of botulinum toxin are well-tolerated and effective, with a low rate of adverse events; however profound ameliorations were seen also in the sham arms of rcts evaluating intraprostatic injections. conclusion: new drugs have been approved in the last years in the medical treatment of bph-related luts. practicing urologists should be familair with their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.
overactive_bladder	aimsrecent studies have used different neuroimaging techniques and identified various brain regions that are activated during bladder filling. however, there is a lack of consensus regarding which of these brain regions regulate the process of urine storage. the aim of this meta-analysis is to identify brain regions that are commonly activated during bladder filling in healthy adults across different studies. methodspubmed was searched for neuroimaging studies investigating the effects of bladder filling on regional brain activation. studies were excluded if they did not report brain activation differences from whole-brain group analysis by comparing the state of bladder filling with the state of bladder rest. the current version of the activation likelihood estimation (ale) approach was used for meta-analysis. resultswe identified 14 neuroimaging studies examining brain activation in response to experimental bladder filling in 181 healthy subjects, which reported 89 foci for ale analysis. the meta-analysis revealed significant activation in multiple brain regions including thalamus (bilaterally), right insula, cerebellum, and brainstem (bilaterally). conclusionsseveral key brain regions involved in sensory processing are commonly activated during bladder filling in healthy adults across different studies. neurourol. urodynam. 36:960-965, 2017.

overactive_bladder	aim: to prospectively investigate the association of bladder function with the nerve growth factor (ngf) concentration in the urine of individuals with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (nlutd) after spinal cord injury (sci). methods: individuals with chronic sci and nlutd presenting for a routine urologic examination at a tertiary urologic referral center were recruited for the study. patient characteristics, the current bladder evacuation method and urodynamic parameters were collected. as controls, individuals with normal bladder function were recruited from the staff of a sci rehabilitation center. the urinary ngf concentration was measured in triplicates by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with a minimal sensitivity of 10pg/ml. results: the data of 10 and 37 individuals with normal bladder function and nlutd, respectively, were analyzed. the urinary ngf concentration was below 10pg/ml in all investigated samples. conclusions: the urinary ngf concentration did not differentiate between individuals with normal bladder function and those with nlutd. at least in patients with sci, the urinary ngf concentration does not seem to be a clinically relevant biomarker for nlutd. neurourol. urodynam. 36:659-662, 2017.

overactive_bladder	purpose: suburethral tapes are a standard surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence. the aim of the study was to evaluate subjective and objective cure rates 10 years after a tension-free vaginal tape-obturator procedure. materials and methods: all 124 patients who underwent the tension-free vaginal tape-obturator procedure at a total of 2 centers in 2004 and 2005 were invited for followup. objective cure was defined as a negative cough stress test at 300 ml. subjects completed khq (king 's health questionnaire), ioq (incontinence outcome questionnaire), fsfi (female sexual function index questionnaire) and pgi-i (patient global impression of improvement). results: overall, 55 of 112 women (49%) who were alive were available for clinical examination and 71 (63%) completed the questionnaires. the objective cure rate in the 55 women examined clinically was 69%, 22% were not cured and 9% (5) had undergone reoperation for recurrent or persistent stress urinary incontinence. treatment was counted as having failed in these 5 women for study purposes. subjective cure was reported by 45 of 71 women (64%). three patients (5%) had vaginal tape extrusion at the time of clinical examination. extrusion in all of them was small and asymptomatic, and did not require treatment for a cumulative extrusion rate of 7%. six women (9%) had undergone reoperation for tension-free vaginal tape-obturator associated complications and 18 (26%) experienced de novo overactive bladder. conclusions: subjective and objective cure rates 10 years after the tension-free vaginal tape-obturator procedure were 69% and 64%, respectively. the vaginal extrusion rate in this study was slightly higher than in other series but major long-term complications appeared to be rare.
overactive_bladder	objective: overactive bladder is a syndrome of urinary frequency and urgency, with or without urge incontinence, in the absence of local pathological factors. since multiple causes are responsible for oab, it requires proper diagnosis and comprehensive management. for decades, flavoxate is a globally used and accepted molecule by the urologists and the general physicians for the symptomatic treatment of oab. in spite of its extensive use in oab, a meta-analysis of the available publications for efficacy, safety and tolerability of flavoxate has not been conducted. this paper evaluates the strength of evidence of clinical effectiveness of safety and tolerability of flavoxate in the symptomatic treatment of oab. methods: review articles, original studies and case reports on medline, the cochrane library, google scholar, scirus, internal repository, etc. were searched using the keyword ""flavoxate"". for the primary outcome, the comparative data of flavoxate versus comparator was extracted for following parameters-overall efficacy and its side effect profile. similarly as for secondary outcome, data were extracted for flavoxate per se for overall efficacy, frequency, urinary incontinence, mixed incontinence, nocturia, unpleasant urination, stranguria and its side effect profile and were analyzed using comprehensive meta-analysis (cma) software version 2.0. results: in the current meta-analysis, 43 relevant published studies were considered which clearly demonstrated that flavoxate had improved clinical efficacy than placebo, emepronium, propantheline, and phenazopyridine. conclusions: amongst all the interventions studied, flavoxate was effective and well-tolerated, with almost negligible side effects, making it worthy of consideration for the treatment of oab.
overactive_bladder	to describe leading hypotheses surrounding the pathophysiology of overactive bladder (oab), as well as describe the mechanisms of action of current treatment options for oab. there are two main underlying mechanisms of oab: mechanisms with increased sensory (afferent) activity and mechanisms with abnormal management of afferent signals. in the former category, increased afferent activity is thought to be related either to abnormalities in the urothelium receptor function and neurotransmitter release (urothelium-based hypothesis) or to abnormalities in myocyte excitability (myogenic hypothesis). in the latter category, oab is thought to be related to the dysregulation of the handling of afferent signals (neurogenic hypothesis). oab is complex and multifactorial in its etiology. further research should be undertaken to better characterize the pathophysiology of the disorder, so that more targeted treatments can be developed.
overactive_bladder	the electrochemical behavior of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-hmt), the active metabolite of antimuscarinic drugs tolterodine and fesoterodine used to treat urge incontinence and overactive bladder, was investigated using cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry at glassy carbon electrode. electrooxidation of 5-hmt proceeds as a complex ph-dependent process. controlled potential electrolysis of 5-hmt solutions was performed at platinum gauze electrode in aqueous-methanolic media. electrolyzed solutions were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. two main oxidation centers of the studied molecule were located: the p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol group and the tertiary amino group. oxidation of the first center proceeds in several steps leading to the formation of 5-formyl tolterodine, p-benzoquinone derivative and several dimeric, hydroxylated and methoxylated products depending on ph of the solution and electrode potential. the second center is oxidized preferentially in alkaline media at higher potentials under the hydrolytic cleavage of diisopropylamine and formation of corresponding aldehydes. mechanism of the electrochemical oxidation of 5-hmt has been proposed.

overactive_bladder	background diseases often carry cultural meanings and metaphors, and these meanings can influence illness experiences and behavioral responses. objectives this research investigated how old cultural stereotypes and new social understandings of overactive bladder (oab) intertwined to influence sick role adaptation and behavioral responses among those with oab. methods a qualitative approach using in-depth individual, semistructured interviews was adopted. thirty patients having oab were purposively sampled from a patient self-help group for people with oab. results the cultural stereotypes about oabas an old people disease, as a hopeless disease without cure, as a sexually related disease, and as a disease of substance usehad significant impact on the social and illness experiences of participants, leading to difficulty in adapting to their sick role, indicated by behavioral responses of denial, concealment, resignation, and self-seclusion. discussion cultural stereotypes of oab significantly influenced sick role adaptation, which affected illness experiences of persons with oab. these cultural stereotypes were associated with behavioral responses that led to difficulties in coping with oab.
overactive_bladder	purpose: the objective of this multicenter cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship of nocturnal polyuria in patients with common lifestyle related diseases and overactive bladder, with special attention to hypertension. materials and methods: after baseline assessment, patients recorded 24-hour urinary frequency/ volume, blood pressure and heart rate for 3 days. they were stratified into 4 groups based on mean blood pressure, including no hypertension, and controllable, untreated and uncontrolled hypertension, respectively. results: the 2,353 eligible patients, who had urinary urgency once or more per week and 1 or more nocturnal toilet visits, were enrolled from 543 sites in japan. of these patients complete data, including the 24-hour frequency volume chart, were collected from 1,271. multivariable analyses showed a statistically significant association of nocturnal polyuria with increasing age (or 1.04, 95% ci 1.02-1.05, p < 0.001) and gender (women vs men or 0.75, 95% ci 0.59-0.96, p = 0.02), and for controllable (or 1.10, 95% ci 0.83-1.460), untreated (or 2.62, 95% ci 1.55-4.45) and uncontrolled (or 1.15, 95% ci 0.81-1.62) hypertension vs no hypertension (p = 0.005). however, when assessed separately in men and women, hypertension and heart rate were significantly associated with nocturnal polyuria in women alone (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia were significantly associated with nocturnal polyuria in men alone (p < 0.001). conclusions: the current study demonstrates that nocturnal polyuria was significantly associated with age, male gender, and untreated hypertension in patients with lifestyle related diseases and overactive bladder. the association between hypertension and nocturnal polyuria was significant in women alone.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: it has been suggested that probiotics may improve gastrointestinal discomfort. not all probiotics exhibit the same effects and consequently meta-analyses on probiotics should be confined to well-defined strains or strain combinations. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a probiotic fermented milk (pfm) that includes bifidobacterium lactis (b. lactis) cncm i-2494 and lactic acid bacteria on gastrointestinal discomfort in the general adult population. methods: double-blind randomized controlled trials in the general adult population comparing pfm with a control dairy product for at least 4 weeks were searched from multiple literature databases (up to february 2015). meta-analyses using random-effects models, with individual participant data were undertaken to calculate an odds ratio (or) or standard mean difference (smd), with a 95% confidence interval (ci). results: the search strategy identified 12,439 documents. overall, three trials with a total of 598 adults (female = 96.5%) met the inclusion criteria. consumption of the pfm product was associated with a significant improvement in overall gastrointestinal discomfort compared with the control product (or = 1.48; 95% ci 1.07-2.05), with a number needed to treat (nnt) of 10.24 (95% ci 5.64-55.93). pfm was also superior to the control in reducing digestive symptoms, as measured using a composite score (smd = -0.21; 95% ci -0.37 to -0.05). sensitivity analyses produced similar results, and the heterogeneity between studies was minimal. conclusions: this meta-analysis shows that the consumption of pfm with b. lactis cncm i-2494 and lactic acid bacteria is associated with a modest but consistent and significant improvement of outcomes related to gastrointestinal discomfort in healthy adults.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	cannabis sativa, a subspecies of the cannabis plant, contains aromatic hydrocarbon compounds called cannabinoids. delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol is the most abundant cannabinoid and is the main psychotropic constituent. cannabinoids activate two types of g-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors: cannabinoid type 1 receptor and cannabinoid type 2 receptor. there has been ongoing interest and development in research to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabis. delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol exerts biological functions on the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. cannabis has been used for the treatment of gi disorders such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. the endocannabinoid system (i.e. endogenous circulating cannabinoids) performs protective activities in the gi tract and presents a promising therapeutic target against various gi conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (especially crohn 's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, and secretion and motility-related disorders. the present review sheds light on the role of cannabis in the gut, liver, and pancreas and also on other gi symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, anorexia, weight loss, and chronic abdominal pain. although the current literature supports the use of marijuana for the treatment of digestive disorders, the clinical efficacy of cannabis and its constituents for various gi disorders remains unclear. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	dietary restriction of certain fermentable carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (fodmap) diet) is effective for managing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). however, there are potential consequences of this diet that relate to its impact on nutritional, microbiological, and health-related quality of life outcomes. evidence suggests that the low fodmap diet leads to some alterations in nutrient intake. for example, carbohydrate intake is reduced, and there is a decrease in the proportion of patients meeting the recommended intake for calcium. intake of other macro and micro-nutrients appears to be adequate in the short term. as well as the impact on nutrient intake, extensive dietary modification can have a pronounced impact on the gastrointestinal microbiota. indeed, recent data suggests the diet markedly reduces luminal bifidobacteria concentration, and there is limited evidence that it reduces total bacteria abundance and concentration of other bacterial groups, for example, faecalibacterium prausnitzii. finally, despite the evidence for its clinical effectiveness in patients with ibs, the restrictive nature of the diet could pose a significant burden on patients, thereby limiting improvements, or indeed worsening health-related quality of life. in conclusion, while robust evidence supports the clinical effectiveness of the low fodmap diet, it is important, considering the likelihood of its continued widespread use in ibs and other functional bowel disorders, that we extend our understanding of the impact of the diet on endpoints that may have potential consequences for long term health.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: limited data are available regarding the reproducibility of lactulose and fructose breath testing for clinical application in functional bowel disorders. objectives: the purpose of this study was to investigate the reproducibility of lactulose and fructose breath hydrogen testing and assess symptom response to fructose testing. methods: results were analysed from 21 patients with functional bowel disorder with lactulose breath tests and 30 with fructose breath tests who completed another test >2 weeks later. oro-caecal transit time, hydrogen responses, both qualitatively (positive/negative) and quantitatively (area under the curve (auc) for hydrogen), were compared between tests. in another 36 patients, data scores for overall abdominal symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, wind, nausea and fatigue were collected during the fructose test and compared to hydrogen responses. results: no correlations were found for lactulose auc (linear regression, p=0.58) or transit time (spearman 's p=0.54) between tests. a significant proportion (30%) lost the presence of fructose malabsorption (p0.05). conclusions: routine use of lactulose and fructose breath tests in functional bowel disorder patients is not supported due to its poor reproducibility and low predictive value for symptom responses.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background/aims abnormal immune regulation and increased intestinal permeability augmenting the passage of bacterial molecules that can activate immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, have been reported in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). the aim was to compare the maturation phenotype of monocytes/macrophages (cd14+) from ibs patients and controls in the presence or absence of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (lps), in vitro. methods mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of 20 rome ii-ibs patients and 19 controls and cultured with or without lps for 72 hours. the maturation phenotype was examined by flow cytometry as follows: m1-early (cd11c(+)cd206(-)), m2-advanced (cd11c(-)cd206(+)cx3cr1(+)); expression of membrane markers was reported as mean fluorescence intensity (mfi). the mann-whitney test was used and significance was set at p < 0.05. results in cd14+ cells, cd11c expression decreased with vs without lps both in ibs (mfi: 8766.0 +/- 730.2 vs 12 920.0 +/- 949.2, p < 0.001) and controls (8233.0 +/- 613.9 vs 13 750.0 +/- 743.3, p < 0.001). m1-early cells without lps, showed lower cd11c expression in ibs than controls (mfi: 11 540.0 +/- 537.5 vs 13 860.0 +/- 893.7, p = 0.040), while both groups showed less cd11c in response to lps (p < 0.01). furthermore, the percentage of ""intermediate"" (cd11c(+)cd206(+)cx3cr1(+)) cells without lps, was higher in ibs than controls (ibs = 9.5 +/- 1.5% vs c = 4.9 +/- 1.4%, p < 0.001). finally, fractalkine receptor (cx3cr1) expression on m2-advanced cells was increased when treated with lps in controls but not in ibs (p < 0.001). conclusions the initial phase of monocyte/macrophage maturation appears to be more advanced in ibs compared to controls. however, the decreased cx3cr1 in patients with ibs, compared to controls, when stimulated with lps suggests a state of immune activation in ibs.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: gastrointestinal dysfunction and vein thrombosis are well-known acute complications after spinal cord injuries (scis). objective: to determine the frequency and risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) in patients with sci. methods: a total of 377 consecutive eligible sci patients tested for sibo with the glucose hydrogen/methane breath test from january 2011 to december 2015 and who had also undergone venous ultrasound study for suspected dvt were evaluated within 3 months after admission. results: seventy-six of the 377 sci patients were dvt-positive (20.2%; 95% confidence interval [ci] 16.1-24.2%), and 145 were sibopositive (38.5%; 95% ci 29.9-59.0%). among the 76 dvt-positive patients, 60 were sibo-positive and 16 were sibo-negative. the difference was statistically significant (41.4% versus 6.9%; odds ratio [or] 5.99; 95% ci 3.15-9.33). among the 145 sibo-positive patients, 60 were dvt-positive and 85 were dvt-negative. the difference was statistically significant (78.9% versus 28.2%; or 2.88; 95% ci 2.12-4.47). in the stepwise multivariate logistic regression, a family history of venous thrombosis (or 2.32; 95% ci 1.60-3.79), chronic kidney disease (or 2.99; 95% ci 1.73-5.08) and the presence of sibo (or 3.72; 95% ci 1.97-6.62) remained associated with dvt. conclusions: these data support an association between sibo and dvt in sci patients. further studies should be carried out with respect to the relationship between sibo and dvt.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	introduction: this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating irritable bowel syndrome patients with a proper dose of moxibustion. methods and analysis: this study will be a 4-week-long, randomised controlled pilot clinical trial. twentyfour patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: a 3 moxibustion treatment intervention group and a 1 moxibustion treatment control group. both groups will receive two moxibustion sessions a week for 4 weeks (8 sessions in total). the primary outcome will be measured using the bowel symptom severity scale. the inclusion criteria are as follows. the patients will be between 18 and 30 years old and of either gender. the patients will have experienced repeated abdominal pain or discomfort (i.e., an uncomfortable sensation not described as pain) at least 3 times per month in association with two or more of the following over the previous 3 months: (a) improvement with defecation; (b) onset associated with a change in the frequency of defecation; (c) onset associated with a change in the form (appearance) of stool. all included patients will have provided written consent to the clinical ethics committee and have agreed with both the clinical trial plan and follow-up observations. ethics and dissemination: this research protocol has been reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the trial centre (semyung korean medicine hospital, irb no. 2016-06-01). the results will be published in a journal and will be disseminated both electronically and in print.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	in this clinical practice guide, an analysis is made of the diagnosis and treatment of adult patients with constipation and abdominal discomfort, under the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation. these have an important personal, health and social impact, affecting the quality of life of these patients. in irritable bowel syndrome with a predominance of constipation, this is the predominant change in bowel movements, with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating and frequent abdominal distension. constipation is characterised by infrequent or difficulty in bowel movements, associated with excessive straining during bowel movement or sensation of incomplete evacuation. there is often no underling cause, with an intestinal functional disorder being considered. they have many clinical and pathophysiological similarities, with a similar response of the constipation to common drugs. the fundamental difference is the presence or absence of pain, but not in a way evaluable way; ""all or nothing"". the severity depends on the intensity of bowel symptoms and other factors, a combination of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms, level of involvement, forms of perception, and behaviour. the rome criteria diagnose functional bowel disorders. this guide is adapted to the rome criteria iv (may 2016) and in this first part an analysis is made of the alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and the criteria for referral between primary care and digestive disease specialists. in the second part, a review will be made of the therapeutic alternatives available (exercise, diet, drug therapies, neurostimulation of sacral roots, or surgery), making practical recommendations for each one of them.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	background we estimated the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and its impact on patient-reported health-related quality of life (hr-qol) in a university-based population aged between 18 and 30 years in bogota, colombia. methods the study had a cross-sectional design. students, faculty, and staff aged 18-30 years of the pontificia universidad javeriana, bogota, colombia were randomly selected and invited to complete an electronic survey containing the rome iii ibs diagnostic questionnaire and an ibs-specific hr-qol instrument (ibs-qol). results a total of 1082 individuals participated in this study. the prevalence of ibs was 24.0% (95% ci 21.3-26.6%). ibs-constipation was the most common subtype (41.9%; 95% ci 35.5-48.4%). the overall ibs-qol score indicated hr-qol impairment (72.1/100). ibs-unsubtyped patients had the highest overall hr-qol (constipation: 70.6; diarrhea: 67.2; mixed: 67.0; unsubtyped: 77.8; p=0.003). ibs non-consulters had higher ibs-qol ""food avoidance"" scores than ibs consulters (60.3 vs. 45.5; p=0.002). conclusion ibs is a prevalent disorder in a university-based population aged 18-30 years and has a significant impact on hr-qol. ibs-unsubtyped subjects had the highest hr-qol compared to other subtypes. food avoidance appears to be a key factor in seeking consultation.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	introduction: gastrointestinal (gi) motility disorders are common in clinical settings, including esophageal motility disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, post-operative ileus, irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea and constipation. while a number of drugs have been developed for treating gi motility disorders, few are currently available. emerging electrical stimulation methods may provide new treatment options for these gi motility disorders.areas covered: this review gives an overview of electrical therapies that have been, and are being developed for gi motility disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, intestinal motility disorders and constipation. various methods of gastrointestinal electrical stimulation are introduced. a few methods of nerve stimulation have also been described, including spinal cord stimulation and sacral nerve stimulation. potentials of electrical therapies for obesity are also discussed. pubmed was searched using keywords and their combinations: electrical stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, sacral nerve stimulation, gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal diseases.expert commentary: electrical stimulation is an area of great interest and has potential for treating gi motility disorders. however, further development in technologies (devices suitable for gi stimulation) and extensive clinical research are needed to advance the field and bring electrical therapies to bedside.
polycythemia_vera	acute coronary syndrome (acs) could be a precious opportunity for patients to reveal concealed diseases other than conventional risk factors for acs, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, etc. in the setting of acs, the intracoronary and systemic prothrombotic environment has led to an increase in the risk of stent thrombosis of which mortality was higher among patients with acs, especially with the highest mortality in patients with st elevation myocardial infarction. the some specific conditions which were concealed beyond the cardiovascular pathophysiology except well-known risk factors for acs and stent thrombosis might involve the onset of acs. we describe a case of a 64-year-old man who was admitted to intensive care unit for chest pain. this case found the possibility that polycythemia vera with janus kinase 2 (jak2) v617f mutation might be a underlying disease of acs with stent thrombosis, and highlighted the importance of recognizing polycythemia vera with jak2 v617f mutation as concealed disease for cardiologists. we would like to report and review the relationship between acs and polycythemia vera with jak2 v617f mutation.
polycythemia_vera	the jak2 v617f mutation can be detected with a high frequency in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn). mpn treatment efficiency can be assessed by jak2 v617f quantification. real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) is widely used for jak2 v617f quantification. emerging alternative technologies like digital droplet pcr (ddpcr) have been described to overcome inherent qpcr limitations. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of ddpcr for jak2 v617f quantification in patient samples with mpn. sensitivity and specificity were established by using dna artificial mixtures. in addition, 101 samples from 59 patients were evaluated for jak2 v617f mutation. limit of detection was 0.01 % for both qpcr and ddpcr. the jak2 v617f mutation was detected in 43 out of 59 patients by both pcr platforms. however, in 14 % of the samples, jak2 v617f mutation was detected only with ddpcr. this 14 % of discrepant samples were from patients shortly after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. percentage of jak2 v617f mutation measured by qpcr and ddpcr in clinical samples showed a high degree of correlation (spearman r: 0.9637 p < 0.001) and an excellent agreement assessed by bland-altman analysis. in conclusion, ddpcr is a suitable, precise, and sensitive method for quantification of the jak 2 v617f mutation.
polycythemia_vera	the mechanisms by which jak2 is activated by the prevalent pseudokinase (jh2) v617f mutation in blood cancers remain elusive. via structure-guided mutagenesis and transcriptional and functional assays, we identify a community of residues from the jh2 helix alpha c, sh2-jh2 linker and jh1 kinase domain that mediate v617f-induced activation. this circuit is broken by altering the charge of residues along the solvent-exposed face of the jh2 ac, which is predicted to interact with the sh2-jh2 linker and jh1. mutations that remove negative charges or add positive charges, such as e596a/r, do not alter the jh2 v617f fold, as shown by the crystal structure of jh2 v617f e596a. instead, they prevent kinase domain activation via modulation of the c-terminal residues of the sh2-jh2 linker. these results suggest strategies for selective v617f jak2 inhibition, with preservation of wild-type function.
polycythemia_vera	introduction: hematological disorders account for about 1.3% of all causes of acute stroke. this systematized review presents updated information on the implications of this category of heterogeneous diseases as a cause of stroke. areas covered: the most relevant aspects of the relationship between stroke and hematological disorders are reported. a high index of suspicion is needed in young stroke patients, patients with recurrent stroke of undetermined cause, and in patients with prior history of venous thrombosis to identify a potential hematological disorder as the definitive etiology of stroke expert commentary: stroke can be the presenting manifestation of a specific hematological disease or may appear as a complication in the course of hematological disorders. it is important to make a correct diagnosis of the underlying hematological disorder in order to treat stroke patients promptly and appropriately as well as to establish the optimal secondary prevention strategy for recurrent vascular cerebral disease.
polycythemia_vera	introduction: enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn) has led to the rapid introduction of novel therapeutic agents into clinical practice. knowledge of the genetic landscape (eg. jak2, mpl and calr as commonly mutated genes) is increasing and has been used to model novel, effective therapies. histone deacetylases (hdac) are heavily involved in epigenetic modulation; their aberrant expression has been demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, in various mpn. a number of hdac inhibitors (hdaci) have since been developed with the aim to reverse this epigenetic dysregulation. areas covered: the role of hdaci in mpn is reviewed in detail in addition to an update on the currently available clinical trial information. it is of pivotal importance to understand how these agents fit into the current therapeutic strategy for management of mpn. expert opinion: hdaci certainly have a role in the management of mpn but clarification on the dosing and scheduling is required. moreover, whether these agents should be used sequentially to agents such as jak inhibitors or in combination is an area of active investigation.
polycythemia_vera	the presence of retinal vasculopathy in the absence of typical predisposing factors should suggest a possible underlying hematologic abnormality. in such cases, a systemic investigation may reveal a potentially fatal hypercoagulability or hyperviscosity syndrome. retinal vein occlusion is the most commonly encountered ophthalmic finding in such syndromes; however, abnormalities of the arterial system, the choroid, and the macula are also possible. visual symptoms may be the only manifestation of the underlying process, making timely diagnosis by the ophthalmologist critical for both treatment and thrombotic prophylaxis. moreover, as newer ophthalmic diagnostic technologies arise, there is an increasingly important role for eye physicians in the management of such syndromes.

polycythemia_vera	pegylated interferon alpha-2a (peg-ifn) has been shown to induce hematologic and molecular responses in patients with the philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns), including polycythemia vera (pv) and essential thrombocythemia (et). we describe a series of patients with long-standing mpns among whom peg-ifn was initiated when they developed anemia and increased bone marrow reticulin fibrosis suggestive of early transformation to post-et (pet) or post-pv (ppv) myelofibrosis (mf). six patients were treated with peg-ifn for a mean duration of 33.8 months (range 2-63 months). five patients had long-standing et (three were calreticulin (calr)-positive, one janus kinase 2 (jak2)-positive, and one jak2-negative and calr-negative), and one had long-standing jak2-positive pv prior to starting peg-ifn. this is the first study to report that, concurrent with the improvement in anemia, serial laboratory studies demonstrate an increase in serum ldh and left-shifted myeloid cells in the peripheral circulation over approximately 6 months, followed by a gradual normalization of these findings. splenomegaly also increased and then resolved among responding patients. serial bone marrow biopsies were available, which showed little change except for improvement in the grade of reticulin fibrosis in two patients. among patients with early transformation to pet or ppv mf, our data support the efficacy of peg-ifn in improving hemoglobin levels and reducing splenomegaly. these peripheral blood findings should not, therefore, be considered evidence of treatment failure within the first year of peg-ifn therapy.
polycythemia_vera	primary myelofibrosis (pmf)-associated pruritus is often severe and requires treatment. fifty-one patients with bone marrow-proven pmf with associated pruritus were identified from a primary cohort of patients with pmf (n = 566) seen at our institution. we conducted a retrospective review of the clinical characteristics, severity of pruritus, type of treatment, and response of these patients. thirty-two out of 51 patients (63 %) reported severe pmf-associated pruritus and required a total of 108 treatment episodes, with complete response (cr), partial response (pr) and no response (nr) observed in 22, 23, and 55 % of episodes, respectively. the most common treatment categories included jak inhibitors (n = 19), anti-depressants (n = 18), and antihistamines (n = 17). highest cr rates were observed in patients treated with a jak inhibitor (53 %) and immunomodulatory drugs (imids (50 %)). emerging targeted therapies may result in better symptom control and higher response rates in patients suffering from severe pmf-associated pruritus.
polycythemia_vera	a 59-year-old italian woman came to our center for revaluation of a previous diagnosis of polycythemia vera. the patient presented with a lifelong history of polycythemia, no increase in white blood cells (wbcs) and platelets, and a negative bone marrow biopsy. analysis of hemoglobin (hb) fractions showed an abnormal fast moving hb component. we aimed to determine if this variant was the cause of polycythemia in this patient. a complete blood count (cbc) was performed by an automated cell counter and hb fractions were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). standard stability tests and oxygen affinity evaluation were also performed. genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the phenol chloroform method and the entire -globin gene was analyzed by direct sequencing. at the hematological level, no anemia or hemolysis was observed but an abnormal hb fraction was detected using cation exchange hplc. molecular analysis of the -globin gene showed heterozygosity for an aag>acg substitution at codon 144, resulting in a lysthr amino acid replacement. we demonstrated that this is a new hb variant with increased oxygen affinity. its altered physiology is caused by the reduction of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-dpg) effects, due to an amino acid substitution in the central pocket near the c-terminal of the chain. we called this new variant hb san cataldo for the native city of proband.
polycythemia_vera	unfavorable patient survival coincides with lineage plasticity observed in human acute leukemias. these cases are assumed to arise from hematopoietic stem cells, which have stable multipotent differentiation potential. however, here we report that plasticity in leukemia can result from instable lineage identity states inherited from differentiating progenitor cells. using mice with enhanced c-myc expression, we show, at the single-cell level, that t-lymphoid progenitors retain broad malignant lineage potential with a high capacity to differentiate into myeloid leukemia. these t-cell-derived myeloid blasts retain expression of a defined set of t-cell transcription factors, creating a lymphoid epigenetic memory that confers growth and propagates myeloid/t-lymphoid plasticity. based on these characteristics, we identified a correlating human leukemia cohort and revealed targeting of jak2/stat3 signaling as a therapeutic possibility. collectively, our study suggests the thymus as a source for myeloid leukemia and proposes leukemic plasticity as a driving mechanism. moreover, our results reveal a pathway-directed therapy option against thymus-derived myeloid leukemogenesis and propose a model in which dynamic progenitor differentiation states shape unique neoplastic identities and therapy responses.
atrial_fibrillation	background: amiodarone (amio) is for many years effectively used to control ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (af) and to convert it into sinus rhythm. however, due to its delayed onset of action, ranolazine (ran), a new antianginal agent with atrial-selective electrophysiologic properties, has recently been attempted as add-on therapy with amio to facilitate af conversion. methods: to establish the role of this combination therapy, we enrolled 173 consecutive patients (68 +/- 10 years, 54% male) with recent-onset (< 48-hour duration) af who were eligible for pharmacologic cardioversion. patients were randomized to intravenous amio (loading dose 5 mg/kg in 1 hour followed by 50 mg/h; n = 81), or amio plus a single oral dose of ran 1 g (n = 92). results: mean left atrial diameter did not significantly differ between groups, amio and amio + ran (4.2 +/- 0.5 cm vs 4.1 +/- 0.4 cm, p = 0.18). the amio + ran group compared with the amio-only group showed significantly shorter time to conversion (8.6 +/- 2.8 hours vs 19.4 +/- 4.4 hours, p < 0.0001) and higher conversion rate at 24 hours (98% vs 58%, p < 0.001). left ventricular ejection fraction did not markedly vary between the two groups and ranged within moderately reduced values. no serious clinically evident adverse effects were observed in any of the patients receiving either amio or the combination treatment. conclusions: our data demonstrate faster sinus rhythm restoration and enhanced conversion rate of af after amio plus ran in patients with preserved ejection fraction and left atrial size, implicating a synergistic effect of the two agents.
atrial_fibrillation	in this study, the left atrial appendage (laa) structure and morphology were assessed using real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (rt3d-tee) and enhanced cardiac computed tomography (ct) scanning, and the two measurements obtained using these different techniques were compared. two hundred nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (nvaf) patients who were prepared to undergo radiofrequency ablation were enrolled, and 62 controls were enrolled prospectively. rt3d-tee and ct were performed, and the following parameters were measured: laa orifice diameter, area, depth, maximum volume, and emptying velocity. the differences between the nvaf patients and controls were compared, and the differences and correlations in the laa parameters between the two imaging techniques were assessed. the nvaf patients had significantly bigger orifice sizes, orifice areas, and maximum volumes, and lower emptying rates. the af cohort had roughly equal proportions of the four morphological types, whereas the controls predominantly had the windsock type. a bland-altman analysis demonstrated that the laa measurements obtained using rt3d-tee were lower than those obtained with the ct. however, linear regression analysis showed the good correlations between the rt3d-tee and ct measurements of the laa orifice area, depth and volume (r = 0.86, 0.63, and 0.75, respectively). the use of rt3d-tee for the visualization and quantitative analysis of laa parameters is feasible, and the obtained measurements correlate well with those obtained with cardiac ct. this technique may be an ideal tool for guiding laa occlusion procedures, and combining these two methods may enhance the accuracy of laa measurements.
atrial_fibrillation	objectives fecal occult blood testing (fobt) is performed routinely before starting therapeutic anticoagulation in patients despite it never being validated to predict gastrointestinal bleeding (gib) risk. our objective was to determine the utility in checking the guaiac fobt test (gfobt) before initiating therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with a new diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (vte). methods this was a retrospective chart review that examined patients with a diagnosis of vte admitted during a 2-year period in one mid-sized tertiary care center. the gfobt was performed before initiating anticoagulation, excluding patients with overt gib, and analysis was performed to determine gib outcomes. in addition, demographics, laboratory data, and comorbidities were recorded at the time of admission, and an admission hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke history, gib history or predisposition, labile international normalization ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly (has-bled) score was recorded to determine other factors that were predictive of new-onset gib when starting anticoagulation. results initially, 718 patients with a new diagnosis of vte were screened for 2 years. ultimately, 375 patients were prescribed anticoagulation therapy and 244 had documented gfobt. of these 375, 14 (3.73%) had a gib episode. a positive gfobt was present on admission in 85.7% of those who bled (p2 at admission significantly predicted gib during admission as well (median 2.4 for those with gib and 1.6 for those without gib, p = 0.02). conclusions despite its beneficial negative predictive value, gfobt before initiating therapeutic anticoagulation is unlikely to change the management of patients without evidence of overt gib.
atrial_fibrillation	patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (icm) are prone to scar-related ventricular tachycardia (vt). the success of vt ablation depends on accurate arrhythmogenic substrate localization, followed by optimal delivery of energy provided by constant electrode-tissue contact. current manual and remote magnetic navigation (rmn)-guided ablation strategies aim to identify a reentry circuit and to target a critical isthmus through activation and entrainment mapping during ongoing tachycardia. the magnetic vt trial will assess if vt ablation using the niobe (tm) es magnetic navigation system results in superior outcomes compared to a manual approach in subjects with ischemic scar vt and low ejection fraction. this is a randomized, single-blind, prospective, multicenter post-market study. a total of 386 subjects (193 per group) will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 between treatment with the niobe es system and treatment via a manual procedure at up to 20 sites. the study population will consist of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) of ae35% and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) who have sustained monomorphic vt. the primary study endpoint is freedom from any recurrence of vt through 12 months. the secondary endpoints are acute success; freedom from any vt at 1 year in a large-scar subpopulation; procedure-related major adverse events; and mortality rate through 12-month follow-up. follow-up will consist of visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, all of which will include icd interrogation. the magnetic vt trial will help determine whether substrate-based ablation of vt with rmn has clinical advantages over manual catheter manipulation.
atrial_fibrillation	leao 's spreading depression of cortical activity is a propagating silencing of neuronal activity resulting from spreading depolarization (sd). we evaluated the contributions of action potential (ap) failure and adenosine a(1) receptor (a(1)r) activation to the depression of evoked and spontaneous electrocorticographic (ecog) activity after sd in vivo, in anesthetized mice. we compared depression with sd-induced effects on ap-dependent transmission, and synaptic potentials in the transcallosal and thalamocortical pathways. after sd, aps recovered rapidly, within 1-2 min, as demonstrated by evoked activity in distant projection targets. evoked corticocortical postsynaptic potentials recovered next, within similar to 5 min. spontaneous ecog and evoked thalamocortical postsynaptic potentials recovered together, after similar to 10-15 min. the duration of ecog depression was shortened 20% by systemic (10 mg/kg) or focal (30 mu m) administration of a(1)r competitive antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (dpcpx). ecog depression was also shortened by focal application of exogenous adenosine deaminase (ada; 100 u/ml), and conversely, was prolonged 50% by the non-competitive ada inhibitor deoxycoformycin (dcf; 100 mu m). we concluded that while initial depolarization block is brief, adenosine a(1)r activation, in part, contributes to the persistent secondary phase of leao 's cortical spreading depression.
atrial_fibrillation	we herein present a case (72 years, male) with total absence of pulmonary veins (pvs) potentials at the beginning of the first procedure for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (af), demonstrating dormant conduction between the left atrium and all pvs revealed by adenosine triphosphate provocation with relation to the incidence of af. he was free from atrial arrhythmias during 1 year follow-up after complete pv isolation with the elimination of multiple transient dormant conductions by circular mapping catheter guide ablation.
atrial_fibrillation	background and purpose-obesity is a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular death but, despite this, an inverse relationship between overweight or obesity and a better cardiovascular prognosis in long-term follow-up studies has been observed; this phenomenon, described as obesity paradox, has also been found evident in atrial fibrillation cohorts. methods-we performed a systematic review on the relationship between body mass index and major adverse outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients. moreover, we provided a meta-analysis of non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants (noacs) trials. results-an obesity paradox was found for cardiovascular death and all-cause death in the subgroup analyses of randomized trial cohorts; however, observational studies fail to show this relationship. from the meta-analysis of noac trials, a significant obesity paradox was found, with both overweight and obese patients reporting a lower risk for stroke/systemic embolic event (odds ratio [or], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.66-0.84 and or, 0.62; 95% ci, 0.54-0.70, respectively). for major bleeding, only obese patients were at lower risk compared with normal weight patients (or, 0.84; 95% ci, 0.72-0.98). a significant treatment effect of noacs was found in normal weight patients, both for stroke/systemic embolic event (or, 0.66; 95% ci, 0.56-0.78) and for major bleeding (or, 0.72; 95% ci, 0.54-0.95). major bleeding risk was lower in overweight patients treated with noacs (or, 0.84; 95% ci, 0.71-1.00). conclusions-there may be an obesity paradox in atrial fibrillation patients, particularly for all-cause and cardiovascular death outcomes. an obesity paradox was also evident for stroke/systemic embolic event outcome in noac trials, with a treatment effect favoring noacs over warfarin for both efficacy and safety that was significant only for normal weight patients.
atrial_fibrillation	aims: correct sizing of a left atrial appendage (laa) closure system is important to avoid redeployment of the device and peri-device leaks. the aims of this study were to assess the significance of two-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography (2d-tee), real-time 3d transoesophageal echocardiography (rt 3d-tee) and angiography for measuring the size of the laa landing zone and to determine the impact on sizing an laa closure device. furthermore, we investigated the relevance of volume loading on laa size. methods and results: in a prospective study, 46 patients underwent 2d-tee and rt 3d-tee 24 hours prior to laa closure, at the beginning of the procedure and just before the procedure after volume loading with an average of 1,035 +/- 246 ml. angiography was performed immediately before the implantation. maximal diameter (2.2 +/- 0.4 versus 2.3 +/- 0.4 cm; p<0.01), perimeter (6.5 +/- 1.0 versus 6.8 +/- 1.0 cm, p<0.01) and area (3.2 +/- 1.0 versus 3.5 +/- 1.1 cm(2), p<0.01) of the laa increased significantly after volume loading. the highest correlation (r) between measurements and laa device size was found for rt 3d-tee-derived perimeter (r=0.97) and area (r=0.96), whereas the maximal diameter (r=0.78) measured by 2d-tee and angiography (r=0.76) correlated less closely. sizing based on an rt 3d-tee-measured perimeter resulted only in 4% of undersizing the implanted device. peri-device leaks occurred in seven cases (15%) and were associated with a lower compression of laa devices (7 +/- 1.3% versus 14 +/- 3.2% for patients without leaks, p<0.001). conclusions: volume loading before laa closure increases laa dimensions significantly. rt 3d-tee measurements show a closer correlation to laa closure device size than 2d-tee or angiographic measurements.
atrial_fibrillation	spreading depolarizations are implicated in a diverse set of neurologic diseases. they are unusual forms of nervous system activity in that they propagate very slowly and approximately concentrically, apparently not respecting the anatomic, synaptic, functional, or vascular architecture of the brain. however, there is evidence that spreading depolarizations are not truly concentric, isotropic, or homogeneous, either in space or in time. here we present evidence from kcl-induced spreading depolarizations, in mouse and rat, invivo and invitro, showing the great variability that these depolarizations can exhibit. this variability can help inform the mechanistic understanding of spreading depolarizations, and it has implications for their phenomenology in neurologic disease.
atrial_fibrillation	many patient with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease have sleep disordered breathing (sdb), which can be either obstructive (with intermittent collapse of the upper airway) or central (episodic loss of respiratory drive). sdb is associated with sleep disturbance, hypoxemia, hemodynamic changes, and sympathetic activation. such patients have a worse prognosis than those without sdb. mask based therapies of positive airway pressure targeted at sdb can improve measures of sleep quality and partially normalize the sleep and respiratory physiology, but recent randomized trials of cardiovascular outcomes in sdb have either been neutral (obstructive sleep apnea) or suggested the possibility of harm, likely from increased sudden death, in central sleep apnea. alternative methods for the treatment of sdb are being explored, including implantable technologies, but these have not been studied in adequately powered randomized controlled studies. international guidelines recommend screening for sdb, which can be done easily in clinical practice, as there may be a role for the treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness, or resistant hypertension, or atrial fibrillation. further randomised outcome studies are required to determine whether mask-based treatment for sdb is appropriate for patients with chronic systolic heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea; for those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; and for those with decompensated heart failure. the case is made that no longer can the surrogate endpoints of improvement in respiratory and sleep metrics be taken as adequate therapeutic outcome measures in patients with sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.
smoking_cessation	aims to (1) identify distinct classes of smokers based on quit day withdrawal symptoms and (2) explore the relations between withdrawal classes and demographics, tobacco dependence, treatment and smoking outcomes. design secondary data analysis of participants (n = 1504) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multi-site smoking cessation trial who provided ecological momentary assessments of withdrawal symptoms on their quit day. participants received smoking cessation counseling and were randomized to receive placebo or one of five active pharmacotherapies. setting research offices in madison and milwaukee, wisconsin, usa. participants adult smokers (n = 1236; 58% female, 86% white), recruited from the community via advertisements, who abstained on their quit day. measurements demographics and tobacco dependence were assessed at baseline and participants carried palmtop computers to record withdrawal symptoms (craving, negative affect, difficulty concentrating, hunger and anhedonia) on their quit day. point-prevalence abstinence and latency to relapse were assessed at 8 weeks and 6 months post-quit. findings latent class analysis identified four withdrawal classes [akaike information criterion (aic) = 70.09]: moderate withdrawal (64% of sample), high craving-anhedonia (8% of sample), affective withdrawal (13% of sample) and hunger (15% of sample). the high craving-anhedonia class reported significantly higher dependence (p < 0.01), were less likely to have received combination nicotine replacement, reported lower week 8 abstinence rates and relapsed sooner than those in the moderate withdrawal class (p < 0.05). the affective withdrawal class reported higher levels of baseline negative affect and life-time psychopathology (p < 0.05) and relapsed more quickly than the moderate withdrawal class (p < 0.01). conclusions while the majority of smokers report typical levels of withdrawal symptoms on their quit day, more than one-third report extreme craving or extreme negative affective or extreme hunger responses to initial abstinence. these distinct quit-day withdrawal symptom patterns are related to baseline characteristics, treatment and cessation success.
smoking_cessation	adolescence is a key developmental period for preventing substance use initiation, however prevention programs solely providing educational information about the dangers of substance use rarely change adolescent substance use behaviors. recent research suggests that mind-body practices such as yoga may have beneficial effects on several substance use risk factors, and that these practices may serve as promising interventions for preventing adolescent substance use. the primary aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of yoga for reducing substance use risk factors during early adolescence. seventh-grade students in a public school were randomly assigned by classroom to receive either a 32-session yoga intervention (n = 117) in place of their regular physical education classes or to continue with physical-education-as-usual (n = 94). participants (63.2 % female; 53.6 % white) completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessing emotional self-regulation, perceived stress, mood impairment, impulsivity, substance use willingness, and actual substance use. participants also completed questionnaires at 6-months and 1-year post-intervention. results revealed that participants in the control condition were significantly more willing to try smoking cigarettes immediately post-intervention than participants in the yoga condition. immediate pre- to post-intervention differences did not emerge for the remaining outcomes. however, long-term follow-up analyses revealed a pattern of delayed effects in which females in the yoga condition, and males in the control condition, demonstrated improvements in emotional self-control. the findings suggest that school-based yoga may have beneficial effects with regard to preventing males' and females' willingness to smoke cigarettes, as well as improving emotional self-control in females. however additional research is required, particularly with regard to the potential long-term effects of mind-body interventions in school settings. the present study contributes to the literature on adolescence by examining school-based yoga as a novel prevention program for substance use risk factors.
smoking_cessation	rationale the lowest threshold content (or ""dose"") of nicotine discriminated in cigarettes may differ due to menthol preference. objectives menthol and non-menthol spectrum research cigarettes differing in nicotine content were used to determine discrimination thresholds. methods dependent smokers preferring menthol (n = 40) or non-menthol (n = 21) brands were tested on ability to discriminate cigarettes (matched for their menthol preference) with nicotine contents of 16-17, 11-12, 5, 2, and 1 mg/g, one per session, from an ""ultra-low"" cigarette with 0.4 mg/g. controlled exposure to each cigarette was four puffs/trial, and the number of sessions was determined by the lowest nicotine content they could discriminate on >80% of trials (i.e., = 5 of 6). we also assessed subjective perceptions and behavioral choice between cigarettes to relate them to discrimination responses. results controlling for fagerstrom test of nicotine dependence score, discrimination thresholds were more likely to be at higher nicotine content cigarettes for menthol vs. nonmenthol smokers (p <.005), with medians of 16 vs. 11 mg/g, respectively. compared to the ultra-low, threshold and subthreshold (next lowest) cigarettes differed on most perceptions and puff choice, but menthol preference did not alter these associations. notably, threshold cigarettes did, but subthreshold did not, increase choice over the ultra-low. conclusions threshold for discriminating nicotine via smoking may be generally higher for menthol vs. nonmenthol smokers. more research is needed to identify why menthol smoking is related to higher nicotine thresholds and to verify that cigarettes unable to be discriminated do not support reinforcement.
smoking_cessation	background: individuals in the criminal justice system demonstrate high rates of cigarette use (70-80%) and low adherence to smoking cessation medication. educational approaches have not been shown to promote adherence or cessation, though medication sampling has boosted both use and cessation. the objective of the present study was to determine whether in vivo nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) sampling approach increases nrt adherence among criminal justice smokers during a subsequent quit attempt. methods: we conducted a pilot study with 43 community corrections smokers randomized to a 4-session (one 30-min session per week) precessation intervention of either in vivo nrt sampling (session 1: patch; session 2: gum; session 3: combination nrt (cnrt); session 4: review) vs. 4 time-matched sessions of standard smoking cessation with cnrt started after session 1. both groups received an additional 8 weeks of cnrt following the four intervention sessions. results: during the in vivo administration of nrt, total withdrawal and craving severity significantly decreased from pre- to post-session compared to control participants. in vivo participants evinced greater patch use at session 4 and greater gum use through week 8 relative to controls. discussion: in vivo nrt sampling may increase nrt adherence relative to standard counseling sessions among criminal justice smokers. a larger trial of this novel intervention appears to be warranted.

smoking_cessation	background: varenicline is an efficacious medicine for smoking cessation (sc) but little is known about the characteristics of varenicline users. this study examined the characteristics of first-time (naive) varenicline users in finland and compared those who had previously used sc pharmacotherapy to those who were trying sc pharmacotherapy for the first time. methods: a cross-sectional survey was conducted in finnish community pharmacies between february 2014 and january 2015. pharmacy customers purchasing a varenicline starter package for the first time ever were asked to complete a questionnaire or to participate in a structured interview conducted by the pharmacist (identical questions). the questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, smoking habits, previous cessation attempts and factors associated with varenicline use. results: altogether 98 people completed the survey. the majority were daily smokers (96%, n = 94), with a history of over 10 years of regular smoking (94%, n = 92), and a strong/very strong nicotine dependence (67%, n = 66). half of the participants (54%, n = 53) were trying a sc pharmacotherapy for the first time. demographic characteristics and smoking habits were similar between first-time and previous users of sc medications (p >0.05). health centers (42%, n = 41) and occupational health care clinics (37%, n = 36) were the most common sources of varenicline prescriptions. the majority of participants received the prescription for varenicline after mentioning their desire for quitting to a physician (70%, n = 69). conclusions: considering the relatively large proportion of sc naive medicine users among new users of varenicline, smokers who have previously been reluctant to quit smoking, to use other pharmacological sc interventions, or perhaps unaware of these options may be interested in attempting cessation with varenicline. most participants made the initiative to discuss their smoking with the physician, which led to varenicline prescribing. this suggests that physicians may not satisfactorily recognize their patients' nicotine dependence and desire to quit, and they should more actively support patients' smoking cessation.
smoking_cessation	introduction: the mechanisms underlying the effects of cigarette smoke and smoking cessation on respiratory secretion, especially in the larynx, remain unclear. objectives: the aims of this study were to determine the effects of cigarette smoke and smoking cessation on laryngeal mucus secretion and inflammation, and to investigate the effects of glucocorticoid administration. methods: we administered cigarette smoke solution (css) to eight-week-old male sprague dawley rats for four weeks, then examined laryngeal mucus secretion and inflammatory cytokine expression on days 1, 28 and 90 after smoking cessation. we also investigated the effects of the glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide when administered on day 1 after smoking cessation. results: exposure to css resulted in an increase in laryngeal mucus secretion that was further excacerbated following smoking cessation. this change coincided with an increase in the expression of mrna for the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, as well as mrna for muc5ac, which is involved in mucin production. triamcinolone suppressed css-induced laryngeal mucus hypersecretion and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. conclusion: cigarette smoke-associated inflammation may contribute to the exacerbated laryngeal mucus hypersecretion that occurs following smoking cessation. the inflammatory response represents a promising target for the treatment of cigarette smoke-associated mucus hypersecretion.

smoking_cessation	objective: to ascertain the perceptions of women from deprived communities on national tobacco control measures in england. methods: a qualitative study of 11 women, smokers and ex-smokers, from disadvantaged areas, who had used the national health service (nhs) stop smoking service. data were collected through a focus group and semi-structured interviews, and subjected to thematic analysis. results: the ban on smoking in confined public places was perceived as an effective measure for tobacco control. methods to restrict accessibility - including removing point-of-sale displays, raising the price, and preventing sales in certain places - were perceived as effective techniques to deter smoking initiation and prevent triggering temptation to smoke for someone motivated to quit, but not helpful to change attitudes or behaviors among current smokers. women felt desensitized to health warnings used on tobacco products. public health campaigns with gain framed messages were more likely to engage smokers to want to quit. of the loss-framed messages, participants felt that focusing on personal appearance and children was effective. conclusions: strategies that are tailored to attitudes and beliefs among women smokers should consider gain-framed messages and messages that focused on the effects to appearance and children to promote cessation and prevent relapse.
smoking_cessation	background and objective: tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for a wide range of respiratory and circulatory diseases in active and passive smokers. well-designed campaigns are raising awareness to the problem and an increasing number of smokers seeks medical assistance to quit their habit. in this context, there is the need to develop mhealth apps that assist and manage large smoke quitting programs in efficient and economic ways. objectives: our main objective is to develop an efficient and free mhealth app that facilitates the management of, and assistance to, people who want to quit smoking. as secondary objectives, our research also aims at estimating the economic effect of deploying that app in the public health system. methods: using java and xml we develop and deploy a new free mhealth app for android, called tcontrol (tobacco-quitting control). we deploy the app at the tobacco unit of the santa maria hospital in lleida and determine its stability by following the crashes of the app. we also use a survey to test usability of the app and differences in aptitude for using the app in a sample of 31 patients. finally, we use mathematical models to estimate the economic effect of deploying tcontrol in the catalan public health system. results: tcontrol keeps track of the smoke-quitting users, tracking their status, interpreting it, and offering advice and psychological support messages. the app also provides a bidirectional communication channel between patients and clinicians via mobile text messages. additionally, registered patients have the option to interchange experiences with each other by chat. the app was found to be stable and to have high performances during startup and message sending. our results suggest that age and gender have no statistically significant effect on patient aptitude for using tcontrol. finally, we estimate that tcontrol could reduce costs for the catalan public health system (cphs) by up to is an element of 400m in 10 years. conclusions: tcontrol is a stable and well behaved app, typically operating near optimal performance. it can be used independent of age and gender, and its wide implementation could decrease costs for the public health system.

smoking_cessation	background: despite advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment have significantly improved survival rates, patients post-treatment-related health needs are often not adequately addressed by current health services. the aim of the women 's wellness after cancer program (wwacp), which is a digitised multimodal lifestyle intervention, is to enhance health-related quality of life in women previously treated for blood, breast and gynaecological cancers. methods: a single-blinded, multi-centre randomized controlled trial recruited a total of 330 women within 24 months of completion of chemotherapy (primary or adjuvant) and/or radiotherapy. women were randomly assigned to either usual care or intervention using computer-generated permuted-block randomisation. the intervention comprises an evidence-based interactive ibook and journal, web interface, and virtual health consultations by an experienced cancer nurse trained in the delivery of the wwacp. the 12 week intervention focuses on evidence-based health education and health promotion after a cancer diagnosis. components are drawn from the american cancer research institute and the world cancer research fund guidelines (2010), incorporating promotion of physical activity, good diet, smoking cessation, reduction of alcohol intake, plus strategies for sleep and stress management. the program is based on bandura 's social cognitive theoretical framework. the primary outcome is health-related quality of life, as measured by the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general (fact-g). secondary outcomes are menopausal symptoms as assessed by greene climacteric scale; physical activity elicited with the physical activity questionnaire short form (ipaq-sf); sleep measured by the pittsburgh sleep quality index; habitual dietary intake monitored with the food frequency questionnaire (ffq); alcohol intake and tobacco use measured by the australian health survey and anthropometric measures including height, weight and waist-to-hip ratio. all participants were assessed with these measures at baseline (at the start of the intervention), 12 weeks (at completion of the intervention), and 24 months (to determine the level of sustained behaviour change). further, a simultaneous cost-effectiveness evaluation will consider if the wwacp provides value for money and will be reported separately. discussion: women treated for blood, breast and gynaecological cancers demonstrate increasingly good survival rates. however, they experience residual health problems that are potentially modifiable through behavioural lifestyle interventions such as the wwacp.
smoking_cessation	in experimental studies the assigned intervention measures the received intervention if full protocol adherence is achieved, but this is rarely the case in public health. the objective of this study was to estimate the effect of a brief counseling intervention delivered in swedish dental clinics on tobacco use cessation, taking non-adherence into account. we conducted three secondary analyses. in a per-protocol analysis the experimental counseling delivered as intended was contrasted to usual care (control). in an as-treated analysis individuals were compared according to the counseling components actually received, disregarding randomization. in an instrumental variable analysis the effect of the intervention among those who would always be treated as assigned was estimated. logistic regression was used to examine the association between tobacco cessation outcomes (seven-day abstinence, three-month abstinence, half-reduction, quit attempts) and the defined exposure to the intervention. protocol adherence in the intervention group was 73.4%. the per-protocol analysis closely replicated the results of the intention-to-treat analysis, showing a statistically significant effect of the brief counseling on the reduction in tobacco consumption or -1.81, 95% ci [1.06, 3.07], but no significant effect for other outcomes. in the as-treated analysis, receiving more counseling components compared with no tobacco counseling increased the likelihood of half-reduction. the instrumental variable yielded biased results. we conclude that despite application problems, conducting per-protocol, as-treated and instrumental variable analyses in randomized trials where experimental conditions are not strictly standardized strengthens and puts in context the inference based on intention-to-treat analysis.

lymphoma	background: pediatric patients with non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) in developing countries (dcs) present with greater tumor load even at lower stages and with comorbidities that impact therapy delivery. this causes toxic mortality with ""standard"" intensive protocols or recurrences with ""gentler"" treatment. objectives: we developed and evaluated a risk stratification schema that guides intensity of therapy. design/methods: sixty-nine patients were prospectively assigned to five risk groups (a-e; n = 6, 15, 16, 15, and 17) following staging and treated with protocols of risk-stratified intensity. risk stratification utilized st. jude stage, disease bulk, and sites involved. results: between 2006 and 2011, 69 patients with b-cell nhl were enrolled. among these, 72.5% were boys with mean age of 6.9 years (+/- 3.33 [sd]; range 2.4-14.2 years). eighty-seven percent had burkitt lymphoma, 82.6% had advanced stage (25 [36.2%] stage iii; 32 [46.4%] stage iv), and 24.6% were central nervous system positive. mean lactate dehydrogenase increased progressively across the risk strata. among these, 0/6, 1/15, 3/16, 2/15, and 7/17 patients relapsed/progressed within each risk stratum. fifteen patients died; three from treatment-related toxicity. at a median follow-up of 6.2 years, the overall and event-free survival (efs) for all patients was 78.1 and 75.4%, respectively; efs was related to risk assignment. the frequency of documented infectious and noninfectious toxicities increased with higher risk group assignment causing prolongation of admissions and potential treatment delays. conclusions: reduction in treatment intensity for an identified subset of patients with nhl is feasible, while high-intensity therapy is required for high-risk groups. this risk stratification system may be a first step toward improving the outcomes in some dcs.
lymphoma	helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a common gastrointestinal bacterial strain closely associated with the incidence of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. a current research and clinical challenge is the increased rate of antibiotic resistance in h. pylori, which has led to a decreased h. pylori eradication rate. in this article, we review recent h. pylori infection and reinfection rates and h. pylori resistance to antibiotics, and we discuss the pertinent treatments. a pubmed literature search was performed using the following keywords: helicobacter pylori, infection, reinfection, antibiotic resistance, bismuth, proton pump inhibitors, vonoprazan, susceptibility, quintuple therapy, dual therapy, and probiotic. the prevalence of h. pylori has remained high in some areas despite the decreasing trend of h. pylori prevalence observed over time. additionally, the h. pylori reinfection rate has varied in different countries due to socioeconomic and hygienic conditions. helicobacter pylori monoresistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole or levofloxacin was common in most countries. however, the prevalence of amoxicillin and tetracycline resistance has remained low. because h. pylori infection and reinfection present serious challenges and because h. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole or levofloxacin remains high in most countries, the selection of an efficient regimen to eradicate h. pylori is critical. currently, bismuth-containing quadruple therapies still achieve high eradication rates. moreover, susceptibility-based therapies are alternatives because they may avoid the use of unnecessary antibiotics. novel regimens, e.g., vonoprazan-containing triple therapies, quintuple therapies, high-dose dual therapies, and standard triple therapies with probiotics, require further studies concerning their efficiency and safety for treating h. pylori.
lymphoma	background: the number of studies on the association between clock genes' polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility has increased over the last years but the results are often conflicting and no comprehensive overview and quantitative summary of the evidence in this field is available. results: literature search identified 27 eligible studies comprising 96756 subjects (cases: 38231) and investigating 687 polymorphisms involving 14 clock genes. overall, 1025 primary and subgroup meta-analyses on 366 gene variants were performed. study distribution by tumor was as follows: breast cancer (n=15), prostate cancer (n=3), pancreatic cancer (n=2), non-hodgkin 's lymphoma (n=2), glioma (n=1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1), colorectal cancer (n=1), non-small cell lung cancer (n=1) and ovarian cancer (n=1). we identified 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) significantly associated with cancer risk: npas2 rs10165970 (mixed and breast cancer shiftworkers), rs895520 (mixed), rs17024869 (breast) and rs7581886 (breast); clock rs3749474 (breast) and rs11943456 (breast); rora rs7164773 (breast and breast cancer postmenopausal), rs10519097 (breast); rorb rs7867494 (breast cancer postmenopausal), per3 rs1012477 (breast cancer subgroups) and assessed the level of quality evidence to be intermediate. we also identified polymorphisms with lower quality statistically significant associations (n=30). conclusions: our work supports the hypothesis that genetic variation of clock genes might affect cancer risk. these findings also highlight the need for more efforts in this research field in order to fully establish the contribution of clock gene variants to the risk of developing cancer. methods: we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on the association between clock genes' germline variants and the risk of developing cancer. to assess result credibility, summary evidence was graded according to the venice criteria and false positive report probability (fprp) was calculated to further validate result noteworthiness. subgroup meta-analysis was also performed based on participant features and tumor type. the breast cancer subgroup was further stratified by work conditions, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status and menopausal status, conditions associated with the risk of breast cancer in different studies.
lymphoma	interpretation of endpoints (e.g. overall response rate) in clinical trials depends on the accurate and reliable measurement and identification of tumors. regulatory agencies recommend blinded reviews of imaging data by independent review committees (ircs). differences in response outcomes that arise between ircs and site investigators raise regulatory/sponsor concerns. here, we evaluate discrepant tumor response assessments by the irc and unblinded investigators (complete versus partial response, respectively) occurring in 52 (13% of 393 irc-assessed responders) of 447 enrolled patients with treatment-naive non-hodgkin lymphoma from a randomized study. the irc and investigators were likely correct' in 73% and 25% of cases, respectively (p<.001). investigators were more likely to make errors by misinterpreting lymph node data and not utilizing pet results. this post hoc finding suggests a possible role for post-training site evaluation/audit, with retraining as needed, and a specialized consensus committee for concurrent blinded review of site/central data.
lymphoma	background: we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of five oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (nas), including lamivudine, entecavir, adefovir, telbivudine and tenofovir, for the prevention of hepatitis b virus (hbv) reactivation and hbv-related complications in chronic hepatitis b virus (chb) infected patients with hematological malignancies receiving chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) by network meta-analysis.methods: the search identified 28 articles involving 5 different prophylactic regimens covering 1478 participants.results: among five prophylactic regimes, tenofovir (predicted probability, 90%), was the most effective intervention followed by entecavir (88%) in preventing hbv reactivation. there was no significant difference between tenofovir and entecavir for preventing hbv reactivation. with regards to other outcomes, tenofovir and telbivudine was not included to evaluate due to lack of relevant studies. entecavir was the most effective intervention in reducing the risk of hbv related hepatitis (100%), hbv related death (61%) and all other causes of hepatitis (98%).conclusion: tenofovir and entecavir might be the most potent regimes in prevention of hbv reactivation for chb infected patients with hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy or hsct.
lymphoma	neuroblastoma is predominantly characterised by chromosomal rearrangements. next to v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog (mycn) amplification, chromosome 7 and 17q gains are frequently observed. we identified a neuroblastoma patient with a regional 7q36 gain, encompassing the enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (ezh2) gene. ezh2 is the histone methyltransferase of lysine 27 of histone h3 (h3k27me3) that forms the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2. h3k27me3 is commonly associated with the silencing of genes involved in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation and cancer. high ezh2 expression correlated with poor prognosis and overall survival independent of mycn amplification status. unexpectedly, treatment of 3 ezh2-high expressing neuroblastoma cell lines (imr32, chp134 and nmb), with ezh2-specific inhibitors (gsk126 and epz6438) resulted in only a slight g1 arrest, despite maximum histone methyltransferase activity inhibition. furthermore, colony formation in cell lines treated with the inhibitors was reduced only at concentrations much higher than necessary for complete inhibition of ezh2 histone methyltransferase activity. knockdown of the complete protein with three independent shrnas resulted in a strong apoptotic response and decreased cyclin d1 levels. this apoptotic response could be rescued by overexpressing ezh2aset, a truncated form of wild-type ezh2 lacking the set transactivation domain necessary for histone methyltransferase activity. our findings suggest that high ezh2 expression, at least in neuroblastoma, has a survival function independent of its methyltransferase activity. this important finding highlights the need for studies on ezh2 beyond its methyltransferase function and the requirement for compounds that will target ezh2 as a complete protein.

lymphoma	an 8-year-old girl presented with back and leg pain and left arm and leg paresis. lumbar puncture was suggestive of lymphocytic meningitis without identified organism. a second lumbar puncture demonstrated a large number of lymphoid b cells, with positive immunohistochemical staining for cd20 and cd25, proving the diagnosis of neurolymphomatosis. brain and spine mri demonstrated involvement of cervical and lumbosacral nerve roots. fdg pet/ct showed multiple bone metastases in addition to nerve involvement. postchemotherapy fdg pet/ct demonstrated complete metabolic response.
lymphoma	background: hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most prevalent lymphoproliferative disorders in pakistan; however, no risk factors for this disease have yet to be established in our population. epstein-barr virus (ebv) is a well-known risk factor for hodgkin lymphoma in endemic regions of the world; however, frequency of its association in our population has not been widely studied. latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1) expression by immunohistochemistry (ihc) is a surrogate marker of ebv in hodgkin lymphoma. therefore, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of expression of lmp1 in cases of hodgkin lymphoma at our institute and its correlation with other clinical and histologic parameters. methods: the study included 66 cases of hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed at liaquat national hospital over a duration of 2 years from january 2014 to december 2015. the slides and blocks of all cases were retrieved, and representative blocks were selected for lmp1 by ihc. lmp1 expression of >10% of cells was considered as positive expression and correlated with histologic subtypes and clinical parameters like age, gender, and site of involvement. results: the mean age of patients was 35.11 (+/- 20.22). lmp1 expression was found in 68.1% (45/66) of cases of hodgkin lymphoma. mean age of the patients with lmp1 expression was 32.04 (+/- 21.02). lmp1 expression was found in 40% cases of lymphocyte-rich, 66.7% of lymphocyte-depleted, 73.9% of mixed cellularity, 66.7% of nodular sclerosis, and 73.7% of classic hodgkin lymphoma, nos. no significant correlation of lmp1 expression with any clinical or histological parameter could be established in our studied patient population. conclusions: a high frequency of expression of lmp1 is seen in cases of hodgkin lymphoma at our setup comparable to endemic regions of the world; therefore, preventive and treatment protocols should be designed accordingly.
lymphoma	immune checkpoint molecules function as a system of checks and balances that enhance or inhibit immune responses to infectious agents, foreign tissues, and cancerous cells. immunotherapies that target immune checkpoint molecules, particularly the inhibitory molecules programmed cell death 1 and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (ctla-4), have revolutionized human oncology in recent years, yet little is known about these key immune signaling molecules in species other than primates and rodents. the tasmanian devil facial tumor disease is caused by transmissible cancers that have resulted in a massive decline in the wild tasmanian devil population. we have recently demonstrated that the inhibitory checkpoint molecule pd-l1 is upregulated on tasmanian devil (sarcophilus harrisii) facial tumor cells in response to the interferon-gamma cytokine. as this could play a role in immune evasion by tumor cells, we performed a thorough comparative analysis of checkpoint molecule protein sequences among tasmanian devils and eight other species. we report that many of the key signaling motifs and ligand-binding sites in the checkpoint molecules are highly conserved across the estimated 162 million years of evolution since the last common ancestor of placental and non-placental mammals. specifically, we discovered that the ctla-4 (mypppy) ligand-binding motif and the ctla-4 (gvyvkm) inhibitory domain are completely conserved across all nine species used in our comparative analysis, suggesting that the function of ctla-4 is likely conserved in these species. we also found that cysteine residues for intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds were also highly conserved. for instance, all 20 cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds in the human 4-1bb molecule were also present in devil 4-1bb. although many key sequences were conserved, we have also identified immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (itims) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (itsms) in genes and protein domains that have not been previously reported in any species. this checkpoint molecule analysis and review of salient features for each of the molecules presented here can serve as road map for the development of a tasmanian devil facial tumor disease immunotherapy. finally, the strategies can be used as a guide for veterinarians, ecologists, and other researchers willing to venture into the nascent field of wild immunology.
lymphoma	we have developed a lymphoproliferative disorder screening tube (lpd-st) with the aim to provide comprehensive immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets with minimal need for additional testing. the lpd-st consists of cd4/kappa fitc, cd8/lambda pe, cd3/cd14ecd, cd38pc5.5, cd20/cd56pc7, cd10apc, cd19apc-a700, cd5apc-a750, cd57/cd23pb and cd45ko. the lpd-st was validated against previously used lymphocyte subset panels in canada (n=60) and in sweden (n=43) and against the oneflow lst (n=60). the lpd-st panel was then implemented in clinical practice using dried monoclonal antibody reagents (duraclone((r))) on 649 patient samples in sweden. in 204 of 649 samples (31%), a monotypic b-cell population was found. of these cases, a final diagnosis could be rendered in 106 cases (52%), and in the remainder, additional b-cell immunophenotyping was performed. in 20 (3%) samples, an aberrant t-cell population was confirmed by additional testing. of 425 samples diagnosed as normal/reactive lymphoid tissue, 50 (12%) required additional immunophenotyping, mostly due to an abnormal cd4/cd8 ratio. the lpd-st tube significantly minimizes the need for additional testing, improves the turn-around time, and reduces the cost of lpd immunophenotyping. it is also suitable for investigating paucicellular samples such as cerebrospinal fluid or fine needle aspirates.
asthma	chrysophanol (ch), extracted from plants of rheum genus, possesses various pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory activity. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of ch on ovalbumin (ova)-induced asthma in mice. fifty mice were randomly assigned to five experimental groups: control group, model group, dexamethasone (2mg/kg) group and ch (5 and 10mg/kg) groups. the number of eosinophil cells and the production of interleukin-6 (il-6), il-1 beta, il-17a and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) were measured. in addition, pulmonary histopathology, airway resistance (raw), t-helper17 (th17) cells frequency and ror gamma t expression were evaluated. our study demonstrated that ch effectively decreased eosinophil count and inflammatory cytokines production in balf. in addition, treatment with ch significantly inhibited the raw, th17 percentage and ror gamma t expression in ova-induced animals compared with those in model group. histological studies also demonstrated that ch significantly suppressed ova-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue compared with model group. our findings supported that ch can prevent allergic asthma in the mouse model.
asthma	introduction: the incorrect use of the flowers, leaves, and seeds of some plants by members of the general public can give rise to serious toxicities. datura innoxia (di), also known as pipe grass or weed wizard, is frequently used for the treatment of asthma and cough and to alleviate cramps. however, di is also a hallucinogenic, with tremendous potential for abuse and can cause anticholinergic toxicity, and serious and fatal complications, such as coma, respiratory failure, and death, have been reported. case report: we present the cases of two women (21 years old and 41 years old) who were admitted to the emergency department with findings of anticholinergic toxicity, including mydriasis, agitation, and delirium, after taking di. the patients' pupils were widely dilated. gastric decontamination and administration of activated charcoal, iv fluids, and midazolam/diazepam were performed. the patients' general conditions were recovered except for mydriasis. however, after 1 week, the diameter of the patients' pupils returned to normal. conclusion: the unconscious misuse of some plants can cause fatal anticholinergic toxicity. such toxicity though has rarely been reported with di. when plants known to cause toxicity are usually endemic, clinicians should be alert to potential anticholinergic toxicity in patients who present with anticholinergic symptoms in these endemic areas.
asthma	introduction: lung cancer and related diseases have been one of the most common causes of deaths worldwide. genomic-based biomarkers may hardly reflect the underlying dynamic molecular mechanism of functional protein interactions, which is the center of a disease. recent developments in mass spectrometry (ms) have made it possible to analyze disease-relevant proteins expressed in clinical specimens by proteomic challenges.areas covered: to understand the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer and its subtypes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), asthma and others, great efforts have been taken to identify numerous relevant proteins by ms-based clinical proteomic approaches. since lung cancer is a multifactorial disease that is biologically associated with asthma and copd among various lung diseases, this study focused on proteomic studies on biomarker discovery using various clinical specimens for lung cancer, copd, and asthma.expert commentary: ms-based exploratory proteomics utilizing clinical specimens, which can incorporate both experimental and bioinformatic analysis of protein-protein interaction and also can adopt proteogenomic approaches, makes it possible to reveal molecular networks that are relevant to a disease subgroup and that could differentiate between drug responders and non-responders, good and poor prognoses, drug resistance, and so on.
asthma	introduction: severe therapy-resistant asthma is an area where there has been recent advances in understanding that is percolating into improvements in management.areas covered: this review covers the recent definition and approach to the diagnosis of severe asthma and its differentiation from difficult-to-treat asthma. the recent advances in phenotyping severe asthma and in ensuing changes in management approaches together with the introduction of new therapies are covered from a review of the recent literature.expert commentary: after ascertaining the diagnosis of severe asthma, patients need to be treated adequately with existing therapies. the management approach to severe asthma now comprises of a phenotyping step for the definition of either an allergic or eosinophilic severe asthma for which targeted therapies are currently available. this will lead to a precision medicine approach to the management of severe asthma.
asthma	research addressing links of work stress or family stress with asthma is constrained by (1) inconsistent evidence, (2) failure to consider the combined exposure to work stress and family stress, and (3) its primary focus on western study populations. we aimed to address these knowledge gaps. we used cross-sectional data collected in 2015 among 7816 women from five professional groups in five chinese cities. work stress was measured by the 10-item effort-reward imbalance (eri) questionnaire. family stress was assessed by a psychometrically evaluated instrument comprising five items on, e.g., familial conflicts or domestic workload. asthma was operationalized by self-reports of a physician diagnosis. associations were examined by multivariable logistic regression estimating odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). both high work stress (i.e., eri score >1) and high family stress (i.e., score above the median) were associated with asthma (or 1.66, 95% ci 1.22-2.27 and or 1.48, 95% ci 1.10-1.99, respectively). women with combined exposure (versus none) had somewhat higher odds of asthma (or 2.13, 95% ci 1.42-3.19) than those with sole exposure to either work stress (or 1.89, 95% ci 1.20-2.96) or family stress (or 1.71, 95% ci 1.03-2.84). interaction terms were significant for continuous variables (p = 0.046), but not for dichotomized variables (p = 0.199). the present study suggests that both work stress and family stress are positively associated with asthma in women in china. further, the combined exposure may be associated with a further excess of asthma occurrence. longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings and to explore potential temporal relationships.
asthma	the purpose of this study was to determine whether playing quest for the code, a computer game designed to teach children about asthma, would help healthy children acquire knowledge about and attitudes towards asthma and whether the beneficial effects would be maintained over time. the sample consisted of 155 children from four middle schools who were randomly assigned to play quest for the code or a game about nutrition serving as the control condition. data were collected on knowledge and attitude pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at follow-up four weeks later. the results revealed that children who played quest for the code were more knowledgeable and had more positive attitudes than their peers in the control condition. and these benefits were maintained on follow-up tests. our findings indicate the effectiveness and potential of using quest for the code as a tool for asthma education in a classroom setting.
asthma	epidemiologic studies have revealed that asian sand dust particles (asds) can affect respiratory and immune health represented by asthma. factors responsible for the exacerbation of asthma remain unclear. the fungus bjerkandera adusta (b.ad) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene (bap) have been identified in asds collected from the atmosphere when an asd event occurred. we investigated the effects of b.ad and bap related to asds on respiratory and immune systems. bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells (apcs) and splenocytes from atopic prone nc/nga mice and human airway epithelial cells were exposed to the b.ad or to bap in the presence and absence of heated-asds (h-asds). b.ad and bap in both the presence and absence of h-asds increased the expression of cell surface molecules on apcs. h-asds alone slightly activated apcs. the expressions induced by b.ad were higher than those induced by bap in the presence and absence of h-asds. there were no remarkable effects on the activation of splenocytes or the proinflammatory responses in airway epithelial cells. these results suggest that b.ad rather than bap contributes to the exacerbation of asthma regardless of the presence or absence of sand particles, particularly by the activation of the immune system via apcs. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
asthma	background: rhinoconjunctivitis is a global health problem and one of the most common chronic conditions in children. development of rhinoconjunctivitis depends on both genetic and environmental factors. many studies have investigated rhinoconjunctivitis, but only few studies have evaluated the risk factors for non-allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in children finding family history of atopic diseases and gender to be of importance. the aim of this study was to investigate possible risk factors in early life for rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic as well as non-allergic, in adolescence. methods: the children in the danish allergy research center cohort were examined eight times from birth to 14 years of age. visits included questionnaire-based interview, clinical examination, skin prick test and specific ige. we used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to investigate the relationship between early-life risk factors and the development of rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic as well as non-allergic, in adolescence. results: follow-up rate at 14-years was 66.2%. the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis was 32.8%. family history of atopic diseases (aor 2.25), atopic dermatitis (aor 3.24), food allergy (aor 3.89), early sensitization to inhalant and food allergens (aor 2.92 and aor 3.13) and male gender (aor 1.90) were associated with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis but not with non-allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. early environmental tobacco exposure was inversely associated with rhinoconjunctivitis (aor 0.42), allergic (aor 0.47) as well as non-allergic (aor 0.43). conclusion: different patterns of associations were revealed when stratifying rhinoconjunctivitis in allergic and non-allergic suggesting that allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and non-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis are different phenotypes.
asthma	aim to investigate the association between the occurrences of developmental defects of enamel (dde), in first permanent molars, and bronchodilators and/or corticosteroid intake for asthma-like episodic treatment at preschool age, in 6-12 year old children. methods children of the case group (n = 70) were followed in the paediatric pulmonary unit and the unit of allergology, asthma and inflammation at 'aghia sofia' children 's hospital, athens, greece and had used asthma drugs during their first 4 years of life. the control group (n = 70) consisted of healthy children who visited the postgraduate paediatric dental clinic, university of athens. information regarding demographic data, medical history, pregnancy, birth weight, duration of breastfeeding, mother 's smoking habits and antibiotic use at preschool age was obtained through a structured questionnaire. details concerning asthma drugs used were extracted from medical records. the children in both groups underwent an oral examination under standard clinical conditions and all surfaces of first permanent molars were assessed for enamel defects using the modified dde index. chi square statistics, mann-whitney u test, spearman correlation coefficient and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis of the data (p <= 0.05). results dde were present in 24 children (34.3%) in the case group and only in 6 (8.6%) in the control, with the difference between the two groups being statistically significant (p < 0.001), while the estimated odds ratio was 5.56. among the children with dde in the case group, 41.6% had at least one hypoplastic molar with loss of enamel. the type of asthma drug, age at treatment onset and duration of drug use were not significantly associated with the severity or extent of dde. among the possible influential factors, gender was the only statistical significant factor. conclusions children treated with asthma drugs for asthma-like episodes at a preschool age showed an overall increased risk for developing enamel defects in their first permanent molars. severe hypoplastic lesions with loss of enamel was a frequent finding among affected molars.
asthma	the monolayer of endothelial cells (ecs) lining the intima of all blood vessel wall forms a semipermeable barrier that regulates tissue-fluid homeostasis, transport of nutrients, and migration of blood cells across the barrier. a number of signaling pathways and molecules mediate endothelial permeability, which plays important roles in a variety of the physiological and pathological conditions. fatty acid binding proteins (fabps) are able to bind various hydrophobic molecules, such as long-chain fatty acids, prostaglandins and eicosanoids. fabp4, a member of the family of fabps, plays an important role in maintenance of glucose and lipid homeostasis as well as angiogenesis. in the present study, we found that fabp11a, the ortholog of mammalian fabp4, was highly expressed in developing brain vessels of zebrafish. knockout of fabp11a gene caused hemorrhage in zebrafish brain. morpholino mediated fabp11a gene knockdown phenocopied the hemorrhage in mutants. furthermore, we demonstrated permeability of brain vessels in fabp11a mutant is significantly higher than that of control. in addition, cox and lox inhibition partially rescued the brain vessel integrity defects caused by fabp11a loss-of-function, suggesting the integrity defect was relevant to the fatty acid function.
bipolar_disorder	clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic, that is established as the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (scz). to date, no study investigating comprehensive dna methylation changes in scz patients treated with chronic clozapine has been reported. the purpose of the present study is to reveal the effects of clozapine on dna methylation in treatment-resistant scz. we conducted a genome-wide dna methylation profiling in peripheral leukocytes (485,764 cpg dinucleotides) from treatment-resistant scz patients treated with clozapine (n = 21) in a longitudinal study. significant changes in dna methylation were observed at 29,134 sites after one year of treatment with clozapine, and these genes were enriched for ""cell substrate adhesion"" and ""cell matrix adhesion"" gene ontology (go) terms. furthermore, dna methylation changes in the crebbp (creb binding protein) gene were significantly correlated with the clinical improvements. our findings provide insights into the action of clozapine in treatment-resistant scz.
bipolar_disorder	the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (trpm2) is a member of g protein coupled receptor superfamily and a novel dual-function protein that possesses both ion channel and adenosine 5'-diphos-phatase ribose (adpr) hydrolase function. trpm2 is involved in ca2+ signaling in various cells as an endogenous redox sensor for oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, and contributes to cytokine production, insulin release, motility, ca2+ entry and ca2+-dependent cellular reactions such as endothelial hyper-permeability and apoptosis. the wide expression of trpm2 might render it as a potentially significant therapeutic target in pathological settings including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and of great relevance in drug design, feed additives and other industries. here, we discuss the trpm2 gene structure, function, its variants, as well as its activators and inhibitors and provide a peptide drug design for modulation of oxidative stress.
bipolar_disorder	a brain network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) and amygdala plays important roles in developmentally regulated cognitive and emotional processes. however, very little is known about the maturation of mpfc-amygdala circuitry. we conducted anatomical tracing of mpfc projections and optogenetic interrogation of their synaptic connections with neurons in the basolateral amygdala (bla) at neonatal to adult developmental stages in mice. results indicate that mpfc-bla projections exhibit delayed emergence relative to other mpfc pathways and establish synaptic transmission with bla excitatory and inhibitory neurons in late infancy, events that coincide with a massive increase in overall synaptic drive. during subsequent adolescence, mpfc-bla circuits are further modified by excitatory synaptic strengthening as well as a transient surge in feedforward inhibition. the latter was correlated with increased spontaneous inhibitory currents in excitatory neurons, suggesting that mpfc-blacircuit maturation culminates in a period of exuberant gabaergic transmission. these findings establish a time course for the onset and refinement of mpfc-bla transmission and point to potential sensitive periods in the development of this critical network.
bipolar_disorder	a recent electrophysiological study suggests existing compensatory brain activity as a mechanism for functional recovery of visual attention detection (the capacity for detecting external cues) in symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients. despite such evidence, little is known about other aspects of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission, such as their capacity to concentrate on the task at hands without being interfered by distracting information. to this end, we recorded event-related brain potentials (erps) from 20 symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls while they engaged in a classic stroop task. symptomatically remitted patients showed comparable stroop interference to healthy controls, indicating a degree of functional recovery of such a capacity in these patients. on the neural level, the n450 over the fronto-central and central regions, a component of the erps related to conflict detection, was found across both groups, although patients presented a reduced n450 relative to healthy controls. by contrast, the amplitude of the sustained potential (sp) (600-800 ms) over the parieto-central and parietal regions, a component of the erps related to conflict resolution, was significantly increased in patients relative to healthy controls. furthermore, such increased sp amplitude correlated positively with improved behavioral accuracy in symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia. these findings reveal that symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia increasingly recruited the parietal activity involving successful conflict resolution to offset reduced conflict detection. therefore, this provides further insight into compensatory mechanisms potentially involving a degree of functional recovery of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission.
bipolar_disorder	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies in psychiatry use various tasks to identify case-control differences in the patterns of task-related brain activation. differently activated regions are often ascribed disorder-specific functions in an attempt to link disease expression and brain function. we undertook a systematic meta-analysis of data from task-fmri studies to examine the effect of diagnosis and study design on the spatial distribution and direction of case-control differences on brain activation. we mapped to atlas regions coordinates of case-control differences derived from 537 task-fmri studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder comprising observations derived from 21,427 participants. the fmri tasks were classified according to the research domain criteria (rdoc). we investigated whether diagnosis, rdoc domain or construct and use of regions-of-interest or whole-brain analyses influenced the neuroanatomical pattern of results. when considering all primary studies, we found an effect of diagnosis for the amygdala and caudate nucleus and an effect of rdoc domains and constructs for the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen and nucleus accumbens. in contrast, whole-brain studies did not identify any significant effect of diagnosis or rdoc domain or construct. these results resonate with prior reports of common brain structural and genetic underpinnings across these disorders and caution against attributing undue specificity to brain functional changes when forming explanatory models of psychiatric disorders.

bipolar_disorder	patient: female, 74 final diagnosis: iliopsoas abscess symptoms: fever medication: - clinical procedure: - specialty: infectious diseases objective: rare disease background: while uncommon, iliopsoas abscesses can become the underlying cause of a fever of unknown origin. even in such cases, it is considered rare for an iliopsoas abscess to extend into the subcutaneous space. case report: a 74-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia was referred to our hospital with a high-grade fever. the patient was unaware of her febrile status prior to admission. there was no previous hospital admission. examination revealed a non-tender mass in the lower right back that the patient had been aware of for approximately 1 month. initially, we considered a subcutaneous abscess; however, computed tomography (ct) detected a large mass in the right retroperitoneum, which extended into the adjacent subcutaneous space. surgical drainage was performed. m. morganii was detected in fluid evacuated from the abscess and in a urine culture. blood cultures were negative. a repeat enhanced ct revealed a right renal abscess with staghorn calculus. this iliopsoas abscess was considered to be due to a renal abscess. the combination of a minimally aggressive bacterial species and the absence of disease awareness resulted in uncontrolled abscess growth in this case. surgical drainage and salvage nephrectomy was subsequently performed, and she was discharged to a nursing home. conclusions: m. morganii can lead to massive abscess formation without an underlying immunocompromised status. iliopsoas abscesses can surreptitiously extend into the subcutaneous space; therefore, not all abscesses observable from the surface are necessarily subcutaneous in origin.
bipolar_disorder	the proliferation of biological psychiatry has greatly increased over the last two decades. with the possibility to carry out brain research using modern technical methods, it seemed that social influencing factors would lose importance in the development of mental diseases; however, in actual fact this does not seem to be justified. it is necessary to overcome this separation, in that social factors are incorporated into a conceptual framework in the development of mental diseases, which simultaneously also takes the results of current neurobiological research into consideration. the aims of this review article are to summarize the current state of sociopsychiatric research and to emphasize the perspectives of the biological principles and their validity with respect to the social dimensions of psychiatry, as exemplified by schizophrenic disorders. the article presents the options for a biosocial approach in social psychiatry and gives an overview of the currently available literature. there is an abundance of neurobiological research approaches, which are closely associated with sociopsychiatric topics, such as social cognition. social psychiatry and biological psychiatry should no longer be considered as diametrically opposed subdisciplines. on the contrary, the options which could emerge from a synthesis must be used in research and clinical practice.
bipolar_disorder	this review aims to summarize information about the genetic etiology of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (adhd), with particular reference to the contributions of our research group. we also discuss the genetic comorbidity estimated from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp 's) between adhd and major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (e), major depressive disorder (mdd), bipolar disorder (bd) and autism spectrum disorders (asd). a high genetic comorbidity was found between e and bd (46%), a moderate comorbidity between mdd and e, mdd and bd and mdd and adhd (18%, 22% and 10% respectively) and a low comorbidity between e and asd (2.5%). furthermore, we show evidence concerning the genetic determination of psychiatric diseases, which is significantly lower when it is estimated from genome wide snp 's rather than using traditional quantitative genetic methodology (adhd = e = 23%, bd = 25%, mdd = 21% and asd =17%). from an evolutionary perspective, we suggest that behavioral traits such as hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity, which play a role in adhd and perhaps also other hereditary traits which are part of major psychiatric disorders, could have had a high adaptive value during the early stages of the evolution of homo sapiens. however, they became progressively less adaptive and definitively disadvantageous, to the extreme that they are involved in frequently diagnosed major psychiatric disorders.
bipolar_disorder	the accepted paradigms of mainstream neuropsychiatry appear to be incompletely adequate and in various cases offer equivocal analyses. however, a growing number of new approaches are being proposed that suggest the emergence of paradigm shifts in this area. in particular, quantum theories of mind, brain and consciousness seem to offer a profound change to the current approaches. unfortunately these quantum paradigms harbor at least two serious problems. first, they are simply models, theories, and assumptions, with no convincing experiments supporting their claims. second, they deviate from contemporary mainstream views of psychiatric illness and do so in revolutionary ways. we suggest a possible way to integrate experimental neuroscience with quantum models in order to address outstanding issues in psychopathology. a key role is played by the phenomenon called the ""stream of consciousness"", which can be linked to the so-called ""gamma synchrony"" (gs), which is clearly demonstrated by eeg data. in our novel proposal, a unipolar depressed patient could be seen as a subject with an altered stream of consciousness. in particular, some clues suggest that depression is linked to an ""increased power"" stream of consciousness. it is additionally suggested that such an approach to depression might be extended to psychopathology in general with potential benefits to diagnostics and therapeutics in neuropsychiatry.

bipolar_disorder	background: data on the reliability and validity of assessments for irritability, particularly behavioral paradigms, are limited. this study examined the test-retest reliability and validity of a frustration paradigm (the affective posner 2 task) and two irritability measures [the affective reactivity index (ari) and child behavior checklist (cbcl) irritability]. methods: participants were 109 youth from a general population sample of twins (aged 9-14 years). participants completed two visits that were 2-4 weeks apart. at both visits, participants completed the affective posner 2 task and self-reported their irritability using the art. parents reported their child 's irritability using the ari and completed the cbcl. results: the affective posner 2 task demonstrated good test-retest reliability, with intraclass correlations (iccs) ranging from .44 to .78. the task effectively evoked negative affect (frustration and unhappiness) at both test and retest, demonstrating its construct validity. moreover, self-rated frustration and unhappiness during the frustration components of the task correlated positively with self-reported but not parent-reported irritability, providing modest support for convergent validity. parent- and child-reports of the ari and parent-reports of the cbcl irritability measure showed excellent test-retest reliability, with iccs ranging from .88 to .90. limitations: the sample consists of mostly twins aged 9-14 years from the communities. thus, results may not generalize to non-twin samples or clinical samples outside of this age range. conclusions: the affective posner 2 paradigm and the ari and cbcl irritability scales may be useful tools for longitudinal or treatment research on irritability.
crohn's_disease	patients with inflammatory bowel disease constitute a population with a special predisposition to develop bacterial, viral and fungal infections. latrogenic immunosuppression, frequent contact with healthcare facilities and surgical interventions are some of the risk factors that explain why these infections are one of the main causes of morbi-mortality in this disease. some of these infections follow a subtle and paucisymptomatic evolution; their diagnosis and management may become a real challenge for the attending physician if their screening is not systematized or they are not considered in the differential diagnosis. the objective of this review is to provide an update from a practical and concise perspective on the knowledge regarding the epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the most common infections.

crohn's_disease	aim management of fistulating perianal crohn 's disease (fpcd) is a significant challenge for a colorectal surgeon. a recent survey of surgical practice in this condition showed variation in management approaches. as a result we set out to devise recommendations for practice for uk colorectal surgeons. method results from a national survey were used to devise a set of potential consensus statements. consultant colorectal surgeons were invited to participate in the exercise via the previous survey and the mailing list of the professional society. iterative voting was performed on each statement using a five-point likert scale and electronic voting, with opportunity for discussion and refinement between each vote. consensus was defined as >80% agreement. results seventeen surgeons and two patient representatives voted upon 51 statements. consensus was achieved on 39 items. participants advocated a patientcentred approach by a colorectal specialist, within strong multidisciplinary teamworking. the use of anti-tnf alpha therapy is advocated. where definitive surgical techniques are considered they should be carefully selected to avoid adverse impact on function. ano/rectovaginal fistulas should be managed by specialists in fistulating disease. stoma or proctectomy could be discussed earlier in a patient 's treatment pathway to improve choice, as they may improve quality of life. conclusion this consensus provides principles and guidance for best practice in managing patients with fpcd.
crohn's_disease	anti-tnf alpha agents emerged in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) as an effective option in situations that, otherwise, would be refractory to medical therapy. cytomegalovirus infection may present with a high spectrum of manifestations and lead to high morbidity and mortality. however, its clinical significance in ibd course remains unknown and data on its association with anti-tnf alpha are limited. this study aims to evaluate cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection/disease in patients with ibd treated with anti-tnf alpha; if possible, possible risk factors associated with cmv infection/disease in ibd patients under anti-tnf alpha as well as the influence of cmv infection/disease in ibd course would be determined. during three consecutive years, all ibd patients starting infliximab in our department were included. cytomegalovirus status before anti-tnf alpha was evaluated. data regarding ibd, therapeutic and ibd course after infliximab, were recorded. cmv analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-cytomegalovirus in peripheral blood and colonoscopy with biopsies (histopathology/immunohistochemistry). we included 29 patients: female-83%; crohn 's disease-51.8%, ulcerative colitis-44.8%, non-classified colitis-3.4%; 23 cytomegalovirus seropositive. median follow-up: 19 months (3-36). during follow-up, 14 patients were under combination therapy with azathioprine and 5 did at least 1 cycle of corticosteroids. twenty-one patients responded to infliximab. we registered 8 exacerbations of ibd. four patients discontinued infliximab: none had cmv infection. we documented 1 case of intestinal cytomegalovirus infection-detected in biopsies performed per protocol in an asymptomatic uc patient, who responded to valganciclovir without infliximab discontinuation. infliximab, with/without immunosuppression, does not confer an increased risk of (re)activation of cytomegalovirus. cytomegalovirus was not responsible neither for significant morbidity nor mortality in ibd.
crohn's_disease	the extraintestinal disorders in crohn 's disease are common and they are part of the diagnostic criteria of the disease. they are varied and can affect the joints, skin, and eyes. so we try to identify their epidemiological aspects and clinical, evolving through a series of 222 cases of crohn 's disease. in our series, 37.83% of patients experienced at least one extraintestinal manifestation. the mean age was 35.25 years, with the sex-ratio of 0.75. joint damage was observed in 33.33% of patients (74 cases), with 28 cases of axial damage and 46 cases of peripheral damage including 9 cases of arthritis. the dermatological disease was observed in 9.45% of patients (22 cases), dominated by oral aphthous ulceration (9 cases), erythema nodosum (5 cases), and pyoderma gangrenosum (4 cases). ocular involvement was observed in 5.40% of patients (12 cases), including two cases of anterior uveitis, six cases of dry eye syndrome, three cases of redness, and one case of episcleritis. the extraintestinal manifestations in crohn 's disease are fairly common and variable, occurring both in pushing period of quiescence of the disease, as they can precede digestive symptoms. joint manifestations are the most common, followed by dermatological manifestations.
crohn's_disease	the introduction of mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) has changed the management of crohn 's fistula, while it remains controversial. the aim of this study was to provide an overview of efficacy and optimum state of mscs treatment on crohn 's fistula. studies reporting mscs treatment on crohn 's fistula were searched and included. a fixed-effects model was used to assess the efficacy of mscs, and outcomes of healing and recurrence were used to evaluate the best states of mscs intervention. fourteen articles were enrolled (n = 477). pooled analysis showed mscs had a significant efficacy compared to other treatments [risk difference: 0.21 (0.09, 0.32), p = 0.000]. notably, after mscs treatment, the group of crohn 's disease activity index (cdai) baseline >150 group had a higher healing rate (hr) and a clinical response (a change in cdai of >50 points) (79.17 +/- 8.78 vs. 47.54 +/- 15.90, p = 0.011) compared to cdai baseline of150) has been a candidate for evaluating effectiveness of mscs application on crohn 's fistula.
crohn's_disease	chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is increasingly recognized in children and adolescents, particularly in countries withwestern lifestyle. as timely diagnosis and therapy have a significant impact on the long-term outcome of the disease, close cooperation between pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists is necessary. in the absence of infectious causes ibd must be excluded in cases of chronic or recurrent symptoms. increased concentrations of inflammatory markers in feces (e. g. calprotectin) are very sensitive in active ibd but not specific. the diagnostic work-up essentially includes endoscopy and small bowel imaging. in addition to pharmaceutical treatment and nutritional therapy for crohn 's disease, new biologicals and immunomodulators are available. to tailor treatment modalities knowledge of drug effects, potential side effects, drug interactions, individual risk factors, ibd phenotype as well as disease activity is required.
crohn's_disease	what is known and objectivesthe safety of continued ustekinumab (ust) therapy during pregnancy remains unclear in patients with crohn 's disease (cd). there are no meta-analysis reports of exposure to ust during pregnancy. the objective was to describe a case of a pregnant patient with cd who was successfully treated with ust maintenance therapy throughout the pregnancy and delivered a baby boy without any congenital malformations, neurological abnormalities or birth defects. case summarya 37-year-old patient with cd treated with ust became pregnant. she had been receiving ust for 8 months at the time. after discussion with the patient and the obstetric team, the ust therapy was continued. the result of treatment was an uneventful pregnancy with delivery, at term, of a healthy boy and the maintenance of clinical, biological and endoscopic remission of cd during and after pregnancy. what is new and conclusionto our knowledge, this is the first reported use of continued ust therapy for cd throughout a pregnancy. the result of treatment was an uncomplicated pregnancy with the mother giving birth to a healthy boy at term and the maintenance of clinical biological and endoscopic remission of cd during and after pregnancy.
crohn's_disease	the etiology and mechanisms for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are incompletely known. determination of new, clinically important mechanisms for intestinal inflammation is imperative for developing effective therapies to treat ibd. we sought to define a widespread mechanism for colon mucosal inflammation via the activation of tgf-beta activated kinase 1 (tak1), a central regulator of cellular inflammatory actions. activation of tak1 and the downstream inflammatory signaling mediators was determined in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) or crohn 's disease (cd) as well as in dss-induced and spontaneous ibd in mice. the role of tak1 in facilitating intestinal inflammation in murine models of ibd was investigated by using (5z)-7-oxozeaenol, a highly selective pharmacological inhibitor of tak1. we found hyper-activation of tak1 in patients with uc or cd and in murine models of ibd. pharmacological inhibition of tak1 prevented loss in body weight, disease activity, microscopic histopathology, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colon mucosa, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine production in two murine models of ibd. we demonstrated that at the early phase of the disease activation of tak1 is restricted in the epithelial cells. however, at a more advanced stage of the disease, tak1 activation predominantly occurs in nonepithelial cells, especially in macrophages. these findings elucidate the activation of tak1 as crucial in promoting intestinal inflammation. thus, the tak1 activation pathway may represent a suitable target to design new therapies for treating ibd in humans.
crohn's_disease	background and aims: vedolizumab is a gut-selective alpha(4)beta(7) integrin antagonist therapy for ulcerative colitis and crohn 's disease. the gemini long-term safety [lts] trial is an ongoing open-label study investigating the safety of vedolizumab. we present interim exploratory analyses of efficacy in patients with crohn 's disease. methods: patients from the c13004, gemini 2 and gemini 3 studies and vedolizumab-naive patients could enrol in gemini lts and received vedolizumab every 4 weeks. data were collected from may 22, 2009 to june 27, 2013. outcomes of clinical response and remission, defined by the harvey-bradshaw index, and health-related quality of life [hrql] were assessed for up to 152 weeks of treatment in the efficacy population. results: among patients with response at week 6 in gemini 2 who received vedolizumab continuously, 83% [n=100/120] and 89% [n=62/70] of patients with available data were in remission after 104 and 152 weeks, respectively. increased dosing frequency from every 8 weeks [gemini 2] to every 4 weeks [gemini lts] improved outcomes in patients who had withdrawn early from gemini 2, with 47% [n=27/57] experiencing clinical response and 32% [n=18/57] in remission at week 52 of gemini lts [up from 39% and 4% before the dose increase]. similar improvements were observed regardless of prior tumour necrosis factor [tnf] antagonist exposure. long-term benefits of hrql were also observed. conclusions: the clinical benefits of vedolizumab continued with long-term treatment regardless of prior tnf antagonist exposure. increased dosing frequency might improve outcomes in patients who lose response to conventional 8-weekly dosing.
crohn's_disease	background: helicobacter pylori (hp) infection is present in about 50% of the global population, and is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic disease and gastric malignancies. hp prevalence in crohn 's disease (cd) patients was shown to be low compared to the general population, and its influence on disease activity is yet to be determined. our aims were to determine the prevalence of hp in a selected group of cd patients with quiescent disease, and to assess the influence of its eradication on disease activity and endoscopic and laboratory activity measures. methods: consecutive cd patients with quiescent disease underwent meticulous disease evaluation with mr enterography (mre), video capsule endoscopy (vce), crp, fecal calprotectin and cdai. all patients were tested for the presence of hp using stool antigen detection kit. patients infected with hp were offered eradication treatment with sequential therapy. hp eradication was confirmed using urease breath test and stool antigen test. the influence of hp eradication on disease activity was assessed. results: out of 56 patients enrolled, six patients (10.7%) had hp infection. of them, five patients had gastro- duodenitis per vce. all hp positive patients were offered eradication treatment and underwent successful eradication. notably, 23 ( 50%) of patients had proximal disease per vce, most of them (78%) were hp negative. cdai, crp, fecal calprotectin and vce lewis inflammatory score did not change significantly following hp eradication, gastric findings on vce were not impacted by hp eradication. conclusions: the prevalence of hp infection in patients with quiescent cd is relatively low. eradication of the bacteria did not significantly change neither disease activity measures nor the presence of gastro- duodenitis per vce, suggesting it might be part of proximal cd. the influence of hp on cd activity merits further investigation.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	the use of quantitative ct analysis in children is limited by lack of normal values of lung parenchymal attenuation. these characteristics are important because normal lung development yields significant parenchymal attenuation changes as children age. to perform quantitative characterization of normal pediatric lung parenchymal x-ray ct attenuation under routine clinical conditions in order to establish a baseline comparison to that seen in pathological lung conditions. we conducted a retrospective query of normal ct chest examinations in children ages 0-7 years from 2004 to 2014 using standard clinical protocol. during these examinations semi-automated lung parenchymal segmentation was performed to measure lung volume and mean lung attenuation. we analyzed 42 ct examinations in 39 children, ages 3 days to 83 months (mean +/- standard deviation [sd] = 42 +/- 27 months). lung volume ranged 0.10-1.72 liters (l). mean lung attenuation was much higher in children younger than 12 months, with values as high as -380 hounsfield units (hu) in neonates (lung volume 0.10 l). lung volume decreased to approximately -650 hu by age 2 years (lung volume 0.47 l), with subsequently slower exponential decrease toward a relatively constant value of -860 hu as age and lung volume increased. normal lung parenchymal x-ray ct attenuation decreases with increasing lung volume and age; lung attenuation decreases rapidly in the first 2 years of age and more slowly thereafter. this change in normal lung attenuation should be taken into account as quantitative ct methods are translated to pediatric pulmonary imaging.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	the present study investigated the effects of diesel exhaust (de) on an experimental model of bleomycin (blm)-induced lung injury and fibrosis in mice. blm was intravenously administered to both nrf2(+/+) and nrf2(-/-) c57bl/6j mice on day 0. the mice were exposed to de for 56 days from 28 days before the blm injection to 28 days after the blm injection. inhalation of de induced significant inhibition of airway clearance function and the proinflammatory cytokine secretion in macrophages, an increase in neutrophils, and severe lung inflammatory injury, which were greater in nrf2(-/-) mice than in nrf2(+/+) mice. in contrast, inhalation of de was observed to induce a greater increase of hydroxyproline content in the lung tissues and significantly higher pulmonary antioxidant enzyme mrna expression in the nrf2(+/+) mice than in nrf2(-/-) mice. de is an important risk factor, and nrf2 regulates the risk of a de inhalation induced immune response during blm lung injury and fibrosis in mice.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: idiopathic and toxic pulmonary fibrosis are severe diseases starting classically in the subpleural area of the lung. it has recently been suggested that pleural mesothelial cells acquire a myofibroblast phenotype under fibrotic conditions induced by tgf-beta 1 or bleomycin. the importance and role of inflammation in fibrogenesis are still controversial. in this work, we explored the role of il-1 beta/caspase-1 signaling in bleomycin lung toxicity and in pleural mesothelial cell transformation. methods: c57bl/6 mice were intravenously injected with either bleomycin or nigericin or nacl as control. in vitro, the met5a cell line was used as a model of human pleural mesothelial cells. results: intravenous injections of bleomycin induced lung fibrosis with histologically-proven peripheral distribution, collagen accumulation in the pleural and subpleural area, and overexpression of markers of myofibroblast transformation of pleural cells which migrated into the lung. these events were associated with an inflammatory process with an increase in neutrophil recruitment in pleural lavage fluid and increased caspase-1 activity. tgf-beta 1 was also overexpressed in pleural lavage fluid and was produced by pleural cells following intravenous bleomycin. in this model, local pleural inhibition of il-1 beta with the il-1 beta inhibitor anakinra diminished tgf-beta 1 and collagen accumulation. in vitro, caspase-1 inhibition interfered with met5a cell transformation into the myofibroblast-like phenotype induced by bleomycin or tgf-beta 1. moreover, nigericin, a caspase-1 activator, triggered transformation of met5a cells and its intra-pleural delivery induced fibrogenesis in mice. conclusions: we demonstrated, after intravenous bleomycin injection in mice, the role of the pleura and highlighted the key role of il-1 beta/caspase-1 axis in this fibrogenesis process.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a severe disease characterized by excessive myofibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix and fibrils deposition, remodelling of lung parenchyma and pulmonary insufficiency. drugs able to reduce disease progression are available, but therapeutic results are unsatisfactory; new and safe treatments are urgently needed. poly(adp-ribose) polymerases-1 (parp-1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme involved in key biological processes: dna repair, gene expression control, and cell survival or death. in liver and heart, parp-1 activity facilitates oxidative damage, collagen deposition and fibrosis development. in this study, we investigated the effects of hydamtiq, a potent parp-1 inhibitor, in a murine model of lung fibrosis. we evaluated the role of parp on transforming growth factor- (tgf-) expression and tgf-/smad signalling pathway in lungs. mice were intratracheally injected with bleomycin and then treated with either vehicle or different doses of hydamtiq for 21 days. airway resistance to inflation and lung static compliance, markers of lung stiffness, were assayed. histochemical and biochemical parameters to evaluate tgf-/smad signalling pathway with alpha-smooth muscle actin (sma) deposition and the levels of a number of inflammatory markers (tumour necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, inos and cox-2) were performed. bleomycin administration increased lung stiffness. it also increased lung parp activity, tgf- levels, psmad3 expression, sma deposition and content of inflammatory markers. hydamtiq attenuated all the above-mentioned physiological, biochemical and histopathological markers. our findings support the proposal that parp inhibitors could have a therapeutic potential in reducing the progression of signs and symptoms of the disease by decreasing tgf- expression and the tgf-/smad transduction pathway.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	pulmonary fibrosis is a serious medical problem that may significantly compromise respiratory functions. the aim of this work was to study the effect of linagliptin and/or calcipotriol on bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis and to explore the possible mechanisms underlying this effect. one hundred and twenty male c57bl/6 mice were divided into 6 equal groups as follows: control group; bleomycin group; bleomycin + carboxymethylcellulose group; bleomycin+ linagliptin group; bleomycin+ calcipotriol group and bleomycin + linagliptin + calcipotriol group. lung weight/body weight index, lung tissue hydroxyproline, collagen, toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), nuclear factor-like 2 (nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (h0-1), malondialdehyde (mda), glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and catalase (cat) were measured. also, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) was analyzed for total and differential leucocytic count, lactate dehydrogenase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-a), interleukin-10 (il-10) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-(31). vascular response to potassium chloride, phenylephrine and carbachol as well as tracheal response to carbachol were measured. also, lung tissue was subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. administration of linagliptin and/or calcipotriol induced significant decrease in the lung weight/body weight index, total leucocytic count, balf lactate dehydrogenase activity, il-10, tnf-ot and tgf-i31 associated with significant decrease in lung tissue mda, nrf2, ho-1, tlr4, hydroxyproline and collagen content with significant increase in tissue gpx and cat and improvement of the pulmonary architecture, vascular and tracheal response compared to bleomycin group. these effects were significant in linagliptin/calcipotriol combination group compared to the use of each of these drugs alone. in conclusion, linagliptin/calcipotriol combination may represent an effective therapeutic modality for amelioration of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ae-ipf) is a rapid and ultimately fatal condition, and no effective treatment has been established. pirfenidone has antifibrotic effects in ipf; however, its efficacy for ae-ipf is unclear. objectives: to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone for ae-ipf. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 135 ipf patients treated during the period from april 2008 to april 2015 and identified and extracted 47 ae-ipf patients (42 men, 5 women; mean age, 73.5 years). the clinical features and outcomes of the 20 patients treated with pirfenidone were compared with those of the 27 patients treated without pirfenidone. we then excluded the 25 patients who did not receive recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhtm) and analyzed data from the remaining 22 patients (20 men, 2 women; mean age, 73.7 years). clinical features and outcomes were compared between the 10 patients treated with pirfenidone and the 12 patients who did not receive pirfenidone. results: there were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics, except for pirfenidone use before onset. three-month survival was significantly better in patients treated with pirfenidone than in the control group (55% vs 34%, p - 0.042). in univariate analysis, nonuse of pirfenidone was a potential risk factor for death at 3 months (hazard ratio, 6.993; p - 0.043) in patients treated with rhtm. conclusion: a regimen of pirfenidone combined with corticosteroids and rhtm may improve survival in patients with ae-ipf.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	risk factors for non-skin cancer de novo malignancy (dnm) after lung transplantation have yet to be identified. we queried the united network for organ sharing database for all adult lung transplant patients between 1989 and 2012. standardized incidence ratios (sirs) were computed by comparing the data to surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program data after excluding skin squamous/basal cell carcinomas. we identified 18 093 adult lung transplant patients; median follow-up time was 1086 days (interquartile range 436-2070). dnms occurred in 1306 patients, with incidences of 1.4%, 4.6%, and 7.9% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. the overall cancer incidence was elevated compared with that of the general us population (sir 3.26, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.95-3.60). the most common cancer types were lung cancer (26.2% of all malignancies, sir 6.49, 95% ci: 5.04-8.45) and lymphoproliferative disease (20.0%, sir 14.14, 95% ci: 9.45-22.04). predictors of dnm following lung transplantation were age (hazard ratio [hr] 1.03, 95% ci: 1.02-1.05, p < 0.001), male gender (hr 1.20, 95% ci: 1.02-1.42, p = 0.03), disease etiology (not cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, hr 0.59, 95% ci 0.37-0.97, p = 0.04) and single-lung transplantation (hr 1.64, 95% ci: 1.34-2.01, p < 0.001). significant interactions between donor or recipient smoking and single-lung transplantation were noted. on multivariable survival analysis, dnms were associated with an increased risk of mortality (hr 1.44, 95% ci: 1.10-1.88, p = 0.009). the authors find that de novo malignancies occur more often in lung transplant recipients as compared to the general u.s. adult population, and are associated with an increased hazard of mortality on multivariable analysis.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	setting: multicentred hospital-based cases and control subjects in korea. objective: to evaluate the association between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) and hazardous materials to which people are occupationally exposed. design: a multicentre, hospital-based, matched case control study was performed. the ratio of ipf cases to controls was 1:1 (n = 78 in each group). ipf cases and controls were matched in terms of age group, sex and place of residence. conditional logistic regression analysis was performed. results: in simple logistic regression analysis, exposure to metal dust and any exposure for >1 year in an occupational setting were significantly associated with ipf (metal dust or 4.00, 95%ci 1.34-11.97; any exposure or 3.67, 95 %ci 1.02-13.14). after adjustment for environmental and military exposures and smoking history, the or for metal dust exposure was 4.97 (95%ci 1.36-18.17) in multiple logistic regression analysis. conclusions: metal dust was associated with incident ipf in seoul and gyeonggi provinces in korea. this information will be used to support a tailored preventive strategy in specific industries or occupations.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	several recent studies have indicated that mir-30a plays critical roles in various biological processes and diseases. however, the mechanism of mir-30a participation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) regulation is ambiguous. our previous study demonstrated that mir-30a may function as a novel therapeutic target for lung fibrosis by blocking mitochondrial fission, which is dependent on dynamin-related protein1 (drp-1). however, the regulatory mechanism between mir-30a and drp-1 is yet to be investigated. additionally, whether mir-30a can act as a potential therapeutic has not been verified in vivo. in this study, the mir-30a expression in ipf patients was evaluated. computational analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay system were used to identify the target gene of mir-30a, and cell transfection was utilized to confirm this relationship. ten-eleven translocation 1 (tet1) was validated as a direct target of mir-30a, and mir-30a mimic and inhibitor transfection significantly reduced and increased the tet1 protein expression, respectively. further experimentation verified that the tet1 sirna interference could inhibit drp-1 promoter hydroxymethylation. finally, mir-30a agomir was designed and applied to identify and validate the therapeutic effect of mir-30a in vivo. our study demonstrated that mir-30a could inhibit tet1 expression through base pairing with complementary sites in the 3' untranslated region to regulate drp-1 promoter hydroxymethylation. furthermore, mir-30a could act as a potential therapeutic target for ipf.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	purpose: solid-organ tumor incidences are higher in solid organ transplant patients than in the general population. the aim of this study was to analyze solid-organ tumor frequency and characteristics in a population of lung transplant patients and provide a brief review of the literature. methods: a retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients who underwent a lung transplant in the lung transplant program at the university hospital of siena, italy, from 2001 to 2014 (n = 119). patients' demographics, pretransplant characteristics, immunosuppressive therapy, and infectious factors were recorded. results: nine patients with a median age of 59.0 years (range 50-63) of our cohort developed a solid-organ tumor (7.5%). most of the patients experienced nonmelanoma skin cancer (44.4%); the others were diagnosed with lung cancer (22.2%), breast cancer (22.2%), and colon-rectal cancer (11.2%). the median time from transplantation to tumor diagnosis was 895.0 days (range 321-2046). no differences in pretransplant characteristics, immunosuppressive therapy, or infectious factors were found between patients who developed solid organ tumors and those who did not. conclusions: the present study confirmed that de novo malignancies are a major issue in lung transplant patients; in particular, skin and lung cancers demonstrated a higher incidence rate. oncologic treatment of these patients is complex, requiring close collaboration between the transplant team and oncologist. strict screening programs are key factors for an early diagnosis and to allow for prompt treatment resulting in a better outcome.
mental_health	immigrants are an important part of the australian labor force and constitute a major source of net labor force growth. immigrants arriving in australia, however, face a number of barriers finding employment that is commensurate with their training and education (reid, australian and new zealand journal of public health 36:120-125, 2012) and can end up in poor-quality jobs. through a series of interviews and focus groups with newcomers, our study examined immigrants' experience of finding employment and their working conditions in australia. in this manuscript, we specifically explore how discrimination shaped workers' experiences and the strategies workers used to overcome and deal with the barriers they encountered. we end with a discussion of how racism and its consequences can impact quality of work and worker health and safety.
mental_health	there is a paucity of data from emergency centers regarding (a) the prevalence of recurrent assault injury and prior psychological trauma, and (b) psychosocial predictors of assault-injury presentation. objective: to address the above gaps to identify psychosocial needs and injury-prevention opportunities. method: patients presenting with assault or unintentional injuries were recruited from 2 emergency centers (ecs; n = 200) and assessed for injury history, traumatic events, and mental disorders. descriptive statistics were computed and predictors for assault-injury presentation and recurrent assault injury were identified using logistic regression. univariate regression models were employed to identify significant variables before entering these into multivariate models. results: the majority of the participants were male (67%), of whom 43% were between the ages of 25 and 40 years. the median number of lifetime traumatic events was 7. recurrent assault injury was found in 31%. these injuries were predicted by lifetime traumatic events other than injury (or = 1.035, 95% ci [1, 1.07]). assault-injury presentation was significantly less likely in female participants (or = 0.221, 95% ci [0.1, 0.5]) and was associated with high levels of witnessing community violence (or = 1.157, 95% ci [1.01, 1.32]). conclusion: patients presenting with assault injuries are at risk for injury recurrence, have high levels of past psychological trauma, and should be screened for psychosocial risk. further research is needed to assess the role of past psychological trauma in risk for assault injury, and clarify treatment needs. the role of ec-based interventions in injury prevention and mental health requires increased recognition in south african policy and practice.
mental_health	objective: to review the current literature for evidence regarding the feasibility and efficacy of smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral intervention mobile applications, compare such to the number of applications on the commercial marketplaces, and explore potential steps forward for research in the field. methods: a literature search was conducted for papers published before february 2015 featuring quantitative results on clinical outcomes regarding the use of a smartphone for cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, and acceptance and commitment therapy. a search for the number of related applications available to consumers on the apple and google play commercial marketplaces was also conducted. results: nine studies, described in 11 articles, were identified that featured the use of smartphones in cognitive-behavioral interventions. the majority of studies presented pilot results suggesting the potential feasibility/efficacy of such apps. four hundred and forty-seven related applications were found to be available on, the commercial marketplaces. conclusions: the research base for smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral intervention mobile applications is preliminary at this point although results are encouraging. there is a discrepancy between the published literature and commercial applications available to consumers. we suggest potential steps forward in research to advance clinical use and research on this topic.
mental_health	as our understanding of the human mind, idioms of human distress and mental health has improved, it has become apparent that culture has an impact on all aspects of our lives, including mental illness. systems of care across the globe need to adapt and adjust delivery of care in order to accommodate the impact of globalisation and therefore be able to deliver person-centred care. a key aspect of delivering personalised care is the development and delivery of culturally adapted interventions that benefit cultural minority groups in developed countries and the majority cultural groups in developing countries. the journey of acknowledging the need for culturally relevant services has begun but we are a long way from delivering the personalised care that people deserve. this paper makes a case for action in this important area.
mental_health	a long-standing belief is that sign language interferes with spoken language development in deaf children, despite a chronic lack of evidence supporting this belief. this deserves discussion as poor life outcomes continue to be seen in the deaf population. this commentary synthesizes research outcomes with signing and non-signing children and highlights fully accessible language as a protective factor for healthy development. brain changes associated with language deprivation may be misrepresented as sign language interfering with spoken language outcomes of cochlear implants. this may lead to professionals and organizations advocating for preventing sign language exposure before implantation and spreading misinformation. the existence of one-time-sensitive-language acquisition window means a strong possibility of permanent brain changes when spoken language is not fully accessible to the deaf child and sign language exposure is delayed, as is often standard practice. there is no empirical evidence for the harm of sign language exposure but there is some evidence for its benefits, and there is growing evidence that lack of language access has negative implications. this includes cognitive delays, mental health difficulties, lower quality of life, higher trauma, and limited health literacy. claims of cochlear implant- and spoken language-only approaches being more effective than sign language-inclusive approaches are not empirically supported. cochlear implants are an unreliable standalone first-language intervention for deaf children. priorities of deaf child development should focus on healthy growth of all developmental domains through a fully-accessible first language foundation such as sign language, rather than auditory deprivation and speech skills.
mental_health	this study conducts an age, period, cohort analysis of how religious involvement affects adult health across the life course and over time in the usa. cross-classified random-effect models are used to examine data drawn from the general social survey, 1972-2008. the research shows clear life course patterns, time trends and birth cohort changes in the religious involvement and health relationship with period effects surpassing cohort effects. for the most part, the results show a loss of advantage in health with age for those who are more involved in religion. period effects are mainly demonstrated by an overall downward trend of self-rated health (srh) attributable to religious denominational differences and various levels of social integration. unlike the period effects, the health disparities associated with religious denominational differences fluctuated when cohort progressed. these findings suggest that in general, the positive effect of religious involvement on srh decreases with age and periods, but its influence on individual srh fluctuates by cohort. it is expected that a downward trend in srh attributable to religious involvement will carry on in future.
mental_health	objective: intimate partner violence (ipv) is a serious public health problem, affecting every 1 in 4 women in their lifetime. latinas have been found to experience ipv at rates equal to or even higher than rates in the general population. the consequences of experiencing such violence can be severe, and result in increased risk for developing both physical and mental health problems, notably, posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd). although treatments for ptsd in ipv-exposed women have been developed and evaluated, this is the first study to test the efficacy of a program tailored specifically to meet the needs of latinas who experience ipv. method: this study examines the efficacy of a spanish-language adaptation of the moms' empowerment program, a 10-week group treatment program for ipv-exposed women. a total of 93 low-income, mostly immigrant latinas were included in this community trial. all women were spanish-speaking, and information about violence exposure and ptsd symptoms were collected immediately before and after the implementation of the intervention. results: findings show that women who participated in the intervention had a significantly greater reduction in ptsd symptoms than women in the wait-list comparison group. specific reductions by symptom domains were also analyzed. conclusions: this adaptation of a program designed to reduce problems associated with experiencing ipv addressed several mental health treatment needs for latinas, particularly the need for services in spanish. these findings demonstrate that it is possible to tailor current treatment programs for ipv in ways that are both effective and culturally sensitive.
mental_health	purposemental health first aid (mhfa), an early intervention training program for general audiences, has been promoted as a means for improving population-level behavioral health (bh) in rural communities by encouraging treatment-seeking. this study examined mhfa 's appropriateness and impacts in rural contexts. methodswe used a mixed-methods approach to study mhfa trainings conducted from november 2012 through september 2013 in rural communities across the country. data sources: (a) posttraining questionnaires completed by 44,273 mhfa participants at 2,651 rural and urban trainings in 50 us states; (b) administrative data on these trainings; and (c) interviews with 16 key informants who had taught, sponsored, or participated in rural mhfa. measure of rurality: rural-urban commuting area codes. analyses: chi-square tests were conducted on questionnaire data. structural, descriptive, and pattern coding techniques were used to analyze interview data. findingsmhfa appears aligned with some key rural needs. mhfa may help to reduce unmet need for bh treatment in rural communities by raising awareness of bh issues and mitigating stigma, thereby promoting appropriate treatment-seeking. however, rural infrastructure deficits may limit some communities' ability to meet new demand generated by mhfa. mhfa may help motivate rural communities to develop initiatives for strengthening infrastructure, but additional tools and consultation may be needed. conclusionsthis study provides preliminary evidence that mhfa holds promise for improving rural bh. mhfa alone cannot compensate for weaknesses in rural bh infrastructure.
mental_health	peer victimization is associated with several mental health and behavioral problems during childhood and adolescence. identifying prospective associations between victimization and factors known to protect against these problems may ultimately contribute to more precise developmental models for victimization 's role in behavioral and mental health. this study tested prospective associations between peer victimization and dispositional mindfulness, defined by non-judgmental and accepting awareness of the constant stream of lived experience, during early adolescence. it was hypothesized that victimization would predict lower levels of mindfulness over a 4-month period. study participants were 152 seventh and eighth grade students (female = 51%, caucasian = 35%, hispanic/latino = 34%, african-american = 13%, and multi-ethnic or other = 18%) participating in a social-emotional learning intervention feasibility trial. a structural equation model tested associations between mindfulness, victimization, and covariates at baseline, and mindfulness and victimization at 4-month posttest. as hypothesized, baseline victimization predicted significantly lower levels of mindfulness at 4-month posttest. baseline mindfulness did not predict victimization. results may reflect victimized youths' mindful awareness being recurrently diverted away from the present moment due to thoughts of prior and/or impending victimization. study implications may include implementing mindful awareness practices as an intervention strategy for victimized youth to enhance and/or restore this promotive factor.
mental_health	purpose of review the purpose of this study was to review the literature on perinatal intimate partner violence, focusing on recent knowledge to guide mental health professionals on the best approaches to identify and treat women exposed to perinatal intimate partner violence. recent findings risk factors have been broadened from individual victim and perpetrator factors to include relationship, community, and societal factors which interact together. better information is now available on how to identify, document, and treat women exposed to violence around the time of conception, pregnancy, and the postpartum period. summary recent information helps psychiatrists and other mental health professionals assist women exposed to violence related to the perinatal period; however, further research is needed to provide improved evidence for optimal interventions for better patient outcomes.
dementia	background: this cross-sectional study examined whether changes occur in people 's capacity to coordinate two simultaneous tasks (dual task) when transitioning from adulthood to later life. the central executive, baddeley 's working memory model component, is responsible for this coordination. contradictory results have been reported regarding the relationship between ageing and dual-task performance; but these seem to be related to methodological issues that have been addressed in this study. methods: nine hundred and seventy-two participants, aged between 35 and 90 years old, volunteered to carry out a verbal digit span task, followed by single and concurrent (dual-task) tests: first, a box crossing task, then, the digit recall task in relation to their memory span, and finally, both these tests simultaneously. results: we found no difference in people 's capacity to coordinate their attention when doing two tasks in adulthood or healthy later life, including those in the oldest age groups. furthermore, gender and educational level were not related to dual-task performance. conclusions: the results support the normal functioning of the central executive in very old people. these data contrast with research with patients suffering from different types of dementia, which show a decrease in their dual-task performance.
dementia	while previous studies suggested that perfusion abnormalities in parkinson 's disease (pd) are driven by dementia, our study aimed to identify perfusion underpinning of cognitive alteration in non-demented pd patients. cerebral blood flow was measured using arterial spin labelling (asl) in 28 pd patients (age 65 years +/- 9.9 sd) and 16 age-matched healthy controls (hc) (age 65 years +/- 7.8 sd), who also underwent neurological and cognitive testing. the 3d pseudocontinuous asl and t2-weighted scans from 22 pd patients and 16 hc were analysed in a voxel-wise manner using spm8 software. associations between the asl values in volumes of interest (vois) and behavioural and cognitive measures were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. posterior cortical hypoperfusion was found in pd patients compared to hc in the left supramarginal gyrus/superior temporal gyrus (voi1) and left posterior cingulate/precuneus (voi2). positive correlation was revealed between perfusion in the voi2 and addenbrooke 's cognitive examination revised (ace-r) scores after filtering out the effect of age, levodopa equivalent dose (led), and total intracranial volume (tiv) (r = 0.51, p = 0.04). conversely, negative correlation between voi1 and ace-r was detected (r = -0.62, p = 0.01) after regressing out the effects of motor impairment, age, led, and tiv. in non-demented subjects with pd, blood flow abnormalities in precuneus/posterior cingulate were linked to the level of motor impairment and global cognitive performance. oppositely, perfusion abnormalities in supramarginal gyrus might serve as a compensatory mechanism for brain degeneration and decreased cognitive performance.
dementia	neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the major depression disorder would increase the risk of dementia in the older with amnestic cognitive impairment. we used granger causality analysis algorithm to explore the amygdala-and hippocampus-based directional connectivity patterns in 12 patients with major depression disorder and amnestic cognitive impairment (mean age: 69.5 +/- 10.3 years), 13 amnestic cognitive impairment patients (mean age: 72.7 +/- 8.5 years) and 14 healthy controls (mean age: 64.7 +/- 7.0 years). compared with amnestic cognitive impairment patients and control groups respectively, the patients with both major depression disorder and amnestic cognitive impairment displayed increased effective connectivity from the right amygdala to the right lingual and calcarine gyrus, as well as to the bilateral supplementary motor areas. meanwhile, the patients with both major depression disorder and amnestic cognitive impairment had enhanced effective connectivity from the left superior parietal gyrus, superior and middle occipital gyrus to the left hippocampus, the z values of which was also correlated with the scores of mini-mental state examination and auditory verbal learning test-immediate recall. our findings indicated that the directional effective connectivity of right amygdala - occipital-parietal lobe - left hippocampus might be the pathway by which major depression disorder inhibited the brain activity in patients with amnestic cognitive impairment.
dementia	objective: the aim of this study was to determine the influence of left ventricular dysfunction type on the pattern of neuropsychological dysfunctions among heart failure (hf) subjects. method: a sub-analysis of the data of subjects recruited in a cross-sectional survey of cognitive dysfunction among nigerians with hf was performed. cognitive performance on the community screening interview for dementia (csi'd), word list learning delayed recall (wlldr), boston naming test (bnt), and modified token test (mtt) were compared between heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (hfref) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (hfpef). clinical and echocardiographic correlation analysis with cognitive performance was performed. results: subjects with hfpef were impaired on the wlldr (71.4% vs. 34.6%, p = .026). the group with hfpef scored lower on the language domain (definition subscale) of csi'd (p =.036), and wlldr (p = .005). the performance on the mtt (p =.185) and bnt (p = .923) were comparable between the two groups. an inverse relationship was found between pulse pressure and delay recall (r = -.565 p = .003) among the cohort with hfpef whereas body mass index, bmi (r = -.737, p = .023) and tricuspid valve e/a ratio, tvea (r = -.650, p = .042) showed an inverse relationship with the total csi'd score in the cohort with hfref. conclusions: cognitive dysfunction is largely similar between the two groups. delay recall is however poorer among subjects with hfpef. regular cognitive screening is advocated among hf subjects to prevent non-adherence with therapeutic options.
dementia	loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (grn), a secreted glycoprotein expressed by neurons and microglia, are a common autosomal dominant cause of frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease commonly characterized by disrupted social and emotional behaviour. grn mutations are thought to cause frontotemporal dementia through progranulin haploinsufficiency, therefore, boosting progranulin expression from the intact allele is a rational treatment strategy. however, this approach has not been tested in an animal model of frontotemporal dementia and it is unclear if boosting progranulin could correct pre-existing deficits. here, we show that adeno-associated virus-driven expression of progranulin in the medial prefrontal cortex reverses social dominance deficits in grn(+/-) mice, an animal model of frontotemporal dementia due to grn mutations. adeno-associated virus-progranulin also corrected lysosomal abnormalities in grn(+/-) mice. the adeno-associated virus-progranulin vector only transduced neurons, suggesting that restoring neuronal progranulin is sufficient to correct deficits in grn(+/-) mice. to further test the role of neuronal progranulin in the development of frontotemporal dementia-related deficits, we generated two neuronal progranulin-deficient mouse lines using camkii-cre and nestin-cre. measuring progranulin levels in these lines indicated that most brain progranulin is derived from neurons. both neuronal progranulin-deficient lines developed social dominance deficits similar to those in global grn(+/-) mice, showing that neuronal progranulin deficiency is sufficient to disrupt social behaviour. these data support the concept of progranulin-boosting therapies for frontotemporal dementia and highlight an important role for neuron-derived progranulin in maintaining normal social function.
dementia	practice effects are improvements on cognitive tests as a result of repeated exposure to testing material. however, variability exists in the literature about whether patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (mci) display practice effects, which may be partially due to the methods used to calculate these changes on repeated tests. the purpose of the current study was to examine multiple methods of assessing short-term practice effects in 58 older adults with mci. the cognitive battery, which included tests of memory (hopkins verbal learning test-revised and brief visuospatial memory test-revised) and processing speed (symbol digit modalities test and trail making test parts a and b), was administered twice across one week. dependent t tests showed statistically significant improvement on memory scores (ps<.01, ds=0.8-1.3), but not on processing speed scores. despite this, the sample showed no clinically meaningful improvement on any cognitive scores using three different reliable change indices. regression-based change scores did identify relatively large groups of participants who showed smaller than expected practice effects, which may indicate that this method is more sensitive in identifying individuals who may portend a declining trajectory. practice effects remain a complex construct, worthy of continued investigation in diverse clinical conditions.
dementia	genome-wide association studies in frontotemporal dementia showed limited success in identifying associated loci. this is possibly due to small sample size, allelic heterogeneity, small effect sizes of single genetic variants, and the necessity to statistically correct for testing millions of genetic variants. to overcome these issues, we performed gene-based association studies on 3348 clinically identified frontotemporal dementia cases and 9390 controls (discovery, replication and joint-cohort analyses). we report association of apoe and tomm40 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, and arhgap35 and serpina1 with progressive non-fluent aphasia. further, we found the epsilon 2 and epsilon 4 alleles of apoe harbouring protective and risk increasing effects, respectively, in clinical subtypes of frontotemporal dementia against neurologically normal controls. the apoe-locus association with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia indicates its potential risk-increasing role across different neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the novel genetic associations of arhgap35 and serpina1 with progressive non-fluent aphasia point towards a potential role of the stress-signalling pathway in its pathophysiology.
dementia	we investigated 998 serial japanese forensic autopsy cases (0-101 years old, mean age 61.7 +/- 21.9), with no case selection, using immunohistochemistry to detect cases with progressive supranuclear palsy (psp). twenty-nine cases (mean age 82.3 +/- 7.2 years, 11 males, 18 females) fulfilled the national institute of neuronal disorders and stroke (ninds)-psp pathological criteria (2.9% of all cases, 4.6% of cases over 60). all had neuronal and glial inclusions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. however, 13 cases had low tau pathology and were categorized as atypical psp. in addition to psp pathology, multiple types of astrocytic inclusions and comorbid proteinopathies, particularly a high prevalence of argyrophilic grain disease, were found. all cases had not been diagnosed with psp and had preserved daily functioning prior to death. however, 14 (48.3%), 11 (37.9%), and 16 (55.2%) cases showed signs of dementia, depressive state, and gait disturbance, respectively. sixteen accidental death cases (55.2%), including from falls and getting lost, and 11 suicide cases (37.9%) appear to have a relationship with incipient psp pathology. cluster analysis using the distribution and amount of 4-repeat-tau pathology classified the cases into three subgroups: group 1 (10 cases) had typical psp pathology and seven cases (70.0%) had dementia as the most frequent symptom; group 2 (7 cases) had significantly higher frequency of gait disorder (6 cases, 85.7%), and less neocortical tau pathology than group 1; group 3 (12 cases) had relatively mild psp pathology and high argyrophilic grain burdens. granular-shaped astrocytes were the dominant astrocytic inclusion in all cases. we conclude that in forensic cases incipient psp occurs with a higher prevalence than expected. if these findings can be extrapolated to other population-based cohorts, psp may be more common than previously thought.
dementia	background: the european association for palliative care (eapc) recently issued a framework that defines optimal palliative care in dementia. however, implementation of the guidelines may pose challenges for physicians working with dementia patients in practice. objective: to measure and compare the perceptions of physicians in two european regions regarding the importance and challenges of implementing recommendations for optimal palliative care in dementia patients. design: cross-sectional observational study. setting: the netherlands and the united kingdom. subjects: physicians (n = 317) providing palliative care to patients with dementia. measurements: postal survey. results: physicians in the netherlands and northern ireland (ni), united kingdom, prioritized the same domains of optimal palliative care for dementia and these match the priorities in the eapc-endorsed guidelines. respondents in both countries rated lack of education of professional teams and lack of awareness of the general public among the most important barriers to providing palliative care in dementia. ni respondents also identified access to specialist support as a barrier. the results indicate that there is a strong consensus among experts, elderly care physicians, and general practitioners across a variety of settings in europe that person-centered care involving optimal communication and shared decision making is the top priority for delivering optimal palliative care in dementia. conclusions: the current findings both support and enhance the new recommendations ratified by the eapc. to take forward the implementation of eapc guidelines for palliative care for dementia, it will be necessary to assess the challenges more thoroughly at a country-specific level and to design and test interventions that may include systemic changes to help physicians overcome such challenges.
dementia	low back pain (lbp) is one of the major disabling health conditions among older adults aged 60 years or older. while most causes of lbp among older adults are non-specific and self-limiting, seniors are prone to develop certain lbp pathologies and/or chronic lbp given their age-related physical and psychosocial changes. unfortunately, no review has previously summarized/ discussed various factors that may affect the effective lbp management among older adults. accordingly, the objectives of the current narrative review were to comprehensively summarize common causes and risk factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) of developing severe/chronic lbp in older adults, to highlight specific issues in assessing and treating seniors with lbp, and to discuss future research directions. existing evidence suggests that prevalence rates of severe and chronic lbp increase with older age. as compared to working-age adults, older adults are more likely to develop certain lbp pathologies (e. g., osteoporotic vertebral fractures, tumors, spinal infection, and lumbar spinal stenosis). importantly, various age-related physical, psychological, and mental changes (e. g., spinal degeneration, comorbidities, physical inactivity, age-related changes in central pain processing, and dementia), as well as multiple risk factors (e. g., genetic, gender, and ethnicity), may affect the prognosis and management of lbp in older adults. collectively, by understanding the impacts of various factors on the assessment and treatment of older adults with lbp, both clinicians and researchers can work toward the direction of more cost-effective and personalized lbp management for older people.
rheumatoid_arthritis	bradykinin (bk) induces inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (ra). resveratrol is a potent activator of sirtl which could modulate inflammation through deacetylating histones of transcription factors. here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying bk-induced cox-2 expression which is modulated by resveratrol/sirtl in human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (rasfs). we found that bi( induced cox-2 protein and mrna expression associated with pge(2) synthesis, and promoter activity was mediated through b2r receptors, which were attenuated by selective b2r antagonist hoel 40 or transfection with b2r sirna. bi(-induced responses were mediated through pkc mu, mapks, ap-1 and nf-kappa b which were inhibited by their respective inhibitors or sirnas. up-regulation of sirtl by resveratrol suppressed the bk-induced cox-2/pge(2) production through inhibiting the interaction of ap-1 and nf-kappa b with cox-2 promoter in rasf5. bk-induced cox-2/pge(2) expression is mediated through a b2r-pkc mu-dependent mapks, ap-1, and nf-kappa b cascade. resveratrol inhibited the phosphorylation and acetylation of p65, c-jun, and fos and reduced the binding to the cox-2 promoter, thereby attenuated the cox-2 expression. therefore, resveratrol may be a promising therapeutic intervention for treatment of inflammatory arthritis.

rheumatoid_arthritis	the aim of the study is to investigate water compartments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). acute inflammatory episodes such as infection stimulate water retention, chiefly implemented by the sympathetic nervous system (sns) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis. this is an important compensatory mechanism due to expected water loss (sweating etc.). since sns and hpa axis are activated in ra, inflammation might be accompanied by water retention. using bioimpedance analysis, body composition was investigated in 429 controls and 156 treatment-na < ve ra patients between january 2008 and december 2014. a group of 34 ra patients was tested before and after 10 days of intensified therapy. levels of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (proanp) and expression of atrial natriuretic peptide in synovial tissue were investigated in 15 controls and 14 ra patients. extracellular water was higher in ra patients than controls (mean +/- sem: 49.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 36.7 +/- 0.1, % of total body water, p < 0.0001). plasma levels of proanp were higher in ra than controls. ra patients expressed anp in synovial tissue, but synovial fluid levels and synovial tissue superfusate levels were much lower than plasma levels indicating systemic origin. systolic/diastolic blood pressure was higher in ra patients than controls. extracellular water levels did not change in ra patients despite 10 days of intensified treatment. this study demonstrates signs of intravascular overload in ra patients. short-term intensification of anti-inflammatory therapy induced no change of a longer-lasting imprinting of water retention indicating the requirement of additional treatment. the study can direct attention to the area of volume overload.
rheumatoid_arthritis	rupture of the patellar tendon is an uncommon injury that requires acute surgical repair to restore the function of the knee. multiple techniques for repair have been described in the literature. complications with these repair techniques include rerupture and extensor lag caused by gap formation at the site of repair. thus, many surgeons have suggested augmenting the standard repair. several methods of augmentation have been described each with disadvantages. the purpose of this article was to present our case series of six patients with acute patella tendon ruptures treated by a novel procedure using strong sutures. in this method, eight strands of four-strong sutures run within the tendon. at the patellar site, a combination of suture button and figure eight pattern techniques is used, avoiding stress concentration. the optimal tension is applied to each suture, so as the patella might be positioned at the original placement. then all sutures are secured onto the tibia. postoperatively with a mean follow-up of 32.7 months (range: 25-48 months), all patients had a stable knee with mean flexion of 143.3 degrees (range: 140-150 degrees) and without any extension lag. with an improvement in the international knee documentation committee score to 86.8 (range: 80-92), the excellent outcome was noted in all patients. the average postoperative lysholm score was 98.8 (range: 97-100) and the average kujala score was 95.2 (range: 92-97). all patients recovered to near-normal strength and stability of the patellar tendon as well as restoration of function after the operation. this augmentation technique offers a distinct advantage over previous augmentation methods and materials, and may be especially useful in managing patellar tendon rupture caused by rheumatoid arthritis or other systemic conditions. for these reasons, we recommend this procedure for acute patellar tendon ruptures.
rheumatoid_arthritis	objectives: belimumab is the first biologic drug approved for systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). here, we aimed to investigate the effects of belimumab on clinical and serologic outcomes, and sought to identify predictors of treatment response in three swedish real-life settings. methods: fifty-eight patients were enrolled at initiation of belimumab and followed longitudinally for up to 53 months. surveillance outcomes included the sle disease activity index 2000 (sledai-2k), 100 mm visual analogue scales for physician 's global assessment (pga), fatigue, pain and general health, and the systemic lupus international collaborating clinics/american college of rheumatology damage index (sdi). assessment of treatment response included the sle responder index (sri). b lymphocyte stimulator (blys) levels were determined using elisa. results: sledai-2k (median baseline score: 8.0; iqr: 4.0-13.8), pga and corticosteroid use decreased during therapy, and patients reported improvements on fatigue, pain, and general health (p1 showed decreased probability and prolonged time to attain sri response (hr: 0.449; 95% ci: 0.208-0.967), as did current smokers compared with nonsmokers (hr: 0.103; 95% ci: 0.025-0.427). in contrast, baseline blys levels >= 12 ng/ml predicted increased probability and shorter time to attain sri response (hr: 2.566; 95% ci: 1.222-5.387). conclusions: disease activity and corticosteroid usage decreased, patient-reported outcomes improved, and no significant organ damage was accrued during follow-up. smoking and organ damage predicted reduced treatment efficacy. these findings might contribute to a better selection of patients who are likely to benefit from belimumab.

rheumatoid_arthritis	ovarian protection from chemotoxicity is essential for reproductive health. our objective is to determine the role of atp-dependent, multidrug resistance transporters (mdrs) in this protection. previously we identified mdr-dependent cytoprotection from cyclophosphamide in mouse and human oocytes by use of mdr inhibitors. here we use genetic deletions in mdr1a/b/bcrp of mice to test mdr function in ovarian somatic cells and find that mdr1a/b/bcrp-/- mice had significantly increased sensitivity to cyclophosphamide. further, estrus cyclicity and follicle distribution in mdrl a/b/bcrp-/- mice also differed from age-matched wildtype ovaries. we found that mdr gene activity cycles through estrus and that mdr-1b cyclicity correlated with 17 beta-estradiol surges. we also examined the metabolite composition of the ovary and learned that the mdrl alb/bcrp-/- mice have increased accumulation of metabolites indicative of oxidative stress and inflammation. we conclude that mdrs are essential to ovarian protection from chemotoxicity and may have an important physiological role in the ovary.

rheumatoid_arthritis	rheumatoid arthritis is an immune-mediated disease that primarily affects diarthrodial joints. susceptibility and severity of this disease are influenced by nongenetic factors, such as environmental stress, suggesting an important role of epigenetic changes. in this review, we summarize the epigenetic changes (dna methylation, histone modification and mirna expression) in fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which are the joint-lining mesenchymal cells that play an important role in joint inflammation and damage. we also review the effects of these epigenetic changes on rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis and discuss their therapeutic potential.
rheumatoid_arthritis	to elucidate the difference between ratios of nurse consultation sought by senior rheumatologists and junior physicians in rheumatology residency training, and also to evaluate physician efficiency index respecting patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). data regarding outpatient visits for ra patients between november 2013 and 2015 were extracted. the mean interval (day) between consultations, the nurse/physician visits ratio, and physician efficiency index (nurse/physician visits ratio x mean interval) for each senior and junior physicians were calculated. disease activity score in 28 joints-c-reactive protein (das28-crp) and health assessment questionnaire (haq) scores were used to monitor treatment outcome. therefore, das28 and haq scores were measured 3 times: firstly at physician consultation, then after nurse consultation, and finally at the third visit, either at a nurse or physician consultation. of 6046 visits, 3699 visits, planned by 11 physicians (4 specialists and 7 junior physicians), were included. these numbers of visits belonged to 672 ra patients, among which 431 (64.1%) patients were female, the mean age being 64.9 +/- 14.1 years, and das28 at baseline was 4.5 +/- 1.2. the nurse/ physician visits ratio (p=.01) and mean efficiency index (p=.04) of senior rheumatologists were significantly higher than that of junior physicians. regression analysis showed a positive correlation between physician postgraduate experience and physician efficiency index adjusted for das28 at baseline and number of patients for each physician (regression coefficient 5.427, 95% confidence interval 1.068-9.787, p=.022). there was a high correlation between physicians' postgraduate experience (year) and the ratio of nurse/ physician visits (r=0.91, p<.001), and also physician efficiency index (r=0.94, p<.001). nurse consultation did not contribute to worsening treatment outcome, since das28 and haq scores were significantly decreased if physician visits were followed by nurse visits (p=.004 for das28 and p=.025 for haq). if junior physicians are supervised to refer ra patients with milder and sufficient treatment plan to nurses, the entire department operates more efficiently, leading to prevent additional expenses (due to the differences in yearly salary of physicians and nurses) and human resource waste. quality of care should be monitored by markers of disease activity and crp.
rheumatoid_arthritis	a cross-sectional reliability study was conducted with 23 normal participants to establish normal values, and the repeatability and validity of distal radioulnar joint translation measurements using ultrasound imaging. static transverse images of maximal supination, neutral and maximal pronation were examined to assess translation, using a method consistent with the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio. translation while gripping a 1kg weight in supinated and pronated positions was then compared with non-gripping translation. there was significantly more ulnar radial translation found with pronation than supination, when compared with neutral. gripping in pronation did not produce statistically significant changes in translation, whereas the changes produced by gripping in supination were significant. internal consistency was deemed very high and the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio values measured using ultrasound imaging were consistent with previously documented values measured by computerized tomography. this study demonstrated that translational movement of the distal radioulnar joint can be reliably detected in healthy participants using ultrasound imaging. this may reduce dependency on other imaging modalities to diagnose distal radioulnar joint instability. level of evidence: 2.
rheumatoid_arthritis	to assess seroprevalence of anti-toxoplasma gondii antibodies; both igg and igm in egyptian rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients versus a non-ra group and to compare anti-toxoplasma antibodies seroprevalence among ra patients receiving traditional treatment and ra patients treated with biologic drug. 60 ra patients and 60 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. patients were categorized into two groups: one group included 30 patients receiving disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards), while the other group included 30 patients receiving biologic agent, infliximab, a tnf-alpha antagonist. serum samples of all investigated persons were examined for anti-toxoplasma antibodies. ra activity markers including rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated protein antibodies, c reactive protein, esr in addition to disease activity score 28 (das28) of ra patients were also evaluated to explore their association with toxoplasma seropositivity. anti-toxoplasma igg antibodies were detected among 46/60 ra patients (76.7%) versus 29/60 controls (48.3%), (p = 0.001). anti-toxoplasma igg titre was higher among ra group [median, (range) = 232.940 (8.949-653.242) iu/ml] than among controls [median, (range) = 68.820 (2.450-318.945) iu/ml], (p < 0.001). no difference was detected among ra patients either on traditional or biologic treatment regarding anti-toxoplasma igg antibodies. no positive anti-toxoplasma igm was detected. a positive correlation was detected between anti-toxoplasma igg titre and disease activity markers. higher seroprevalence of anti-toxoplasma igg antibodies among ra patients compared to controls reflects an association between latent toxoplasma infection and ra. our findings support previous studies and necessitate future large-scale studies to elucidate the exact role of toxoplasma whether a trigger of autoimmunity in ra or an effect of immunosuppression.
rheumatoid_arthritis	progranulin (pgrn) restrains inflammation and is therapeutic against inflammatory arthritis; however, the underlying immunological mechanism remains unknown. in this study, we demonstrated that antiinflammatory cytokine il-10 was a critical mediator for pgrn-mediated anti-inflammation in collagen-induced arthritisbyusingpgrnandil-10geneticallymodifiedmousemodels. il-10greenfluorescentproteinreportermice revealed that regulatory t (treg) cells were the predominant source of il-10 in response to pgrn. in addition, pgrn-mediated expansion and activation of treg cells, as well as il-10 production, depends on jnk signaling, but not on known pgrn-activated erk and pi3k pathways. furthermore, microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing screens led to the discovery of forkhead box protein o4 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 as the transcription factors required for pgrninduction of il-10 in(treg) cells. these findings define a previously unrecognized signaling pathway that underlies il-10 production bypgrnin treg cells and present new insights into the mechanisms by which pgrn resolves inflammation in inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, particularly inflammatory arthritis.-fu, w., hu, w., shi, l., mundra, j. j. xiao, g., dustin, m. l., liu, c. foxo4-and stat3-dependent il-10 production by progranulin in regulatory t cells restrains inflammatory arthritis.
osteoporosis	background: vitamin d, and possibly vitamin k, has an established association to fracture risk. other vitamins are, however, less studied. aim: to determine whether specific micronutrients other than 25(oh)d and vitamin k play a role in risk of hip fracture and bone turnover. methods: in this case control study, blood was drawn for measurements of vitamins a, b6, b12, c, e, and folic acid as well as the bone turnover markers osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase upon admission for hip fracture in 116 patients and in 73 home-dwelling non fractured controls. results for vitamin k1 and 25(oh)d from the same populations have been reported previously. results: low vitamin a, c, and e concentrations were independently associated with a risk of hip fracture. the adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) per 10 smol/l increase in vitamin a concentration was 0.74 (0.65-0.84); for 1 jtmol/l vitamin c and e: 0.94 (0.92-0.97) and 0.81 (0.74-0.89) respectively. the results were principally unchanged when 25(oh)d, vitamin k1, body mass index, and other potential confounders were adjusted for. all vitamins except b12 and folic acid correlated positively with total osteocalcin and negatively with bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. conclusions: low vitamin a, c, and e concentrations are associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, possibly mediated through bone turnover mechanisms.

osteoporosis	vertebral fracture assessment (vfa) by dxa is an accepted tool in adults. however, its use in children has not been assessed. the aim of this study was to evaluate dxa vfa and morphometric analysis (mxa) using a ge lunar idxa bone densitometer against spinal radiographic assessment (ra) for the identification of vertebral fractures in children. spine ra and vfa (t3-l5) were acquired on the same day in 80 children. forty children considered high risk for fracture by their metabolic bone specialist were referred for spinal ra. another 40 children were recruited as part of a prospective fracture study and were considered low risk for vertebral fracture. agreement between ra and vfa was assessed by an expert paediatric radiologist and two paediatricians with expertise in bone pathology. agreement between ra and mxa was assessed by an expert paediatric radiologist, two clinical scientists and an experienced paediatric radiographer. vertebrae were ranked as normal, mild, moderate or severe if they had50% deformity, respectively. levels of agreement were calculated using the cohen kappa score. evaluating the data from all readable vertebrae, 121 mild, 44 moderate and 16 severe vertebral fractures were identified; with 26, 8, and 5 subjects having at least one mild, moderate or severe fracture, respectively. depending on rater, 92.8-94.8% of the vertebrae were evaluable by ra. in contrast, 98.4% were evaluable by vfa and only 83.6% were evaluable by mxa moderate agreement was found between raters for ra [kappa 0.526-0.592], and vfa [kappa 0.601-0.658] and between ra and vfa [kappa 0.630-0.687]. in contrast, only slight agreement was noted between raters for mxa [kappa 0.361-0.406] and between vfa and mxa [kappa 0.137-0.325]. agreement substantially improved if the deformities were dichotomised as normal or mild versus moderate or severe [kappa 0.826-0.834]. for the detection of moderate and/or severe fractures the sensitivities & specificities were 81.3% & 99.3%, and 62.5% & 99.2% for vfa and mxa, respectively. this study demonstrates that vfa is as good as ra for detecting moderate and severe vertebral fractures. given the significant radiation dose saving of vfa compared with ra, vfa is recommended as a diagnostic tool for the assessment of moderate or severe vertebral fracture in children. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
osteoporosis	background: previous studies have noticed the high incidence of suboptimal vitamin d (vtd) status and bone loss in short bowel syndrome (sbs) with parenteral nutrition (pn) dependence. however, limited data have focused on adult sbs without pn dependence. therefore, our objective was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of suboptimal vtd status and bone loss in adult sbs even after weaning off pn. materials and methods: we performed a prospective study of 60 adult patients with sbs. serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25-ohd) was measured by radioimmunoassay. bone mineral density (bmd) was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa). medical records and various laboratory parameters were collected in all participants. results: suboptimal vtd status was identified in all individuals, including 3 (5.0%) with vtd insufficiency and 57 (95.0%) with vtd deficiency. residual small bowel length (b, 0.072, p = .001) and duration of sbs (b, -0.066, p = .020) were both significantly correlated with suboptimal vtd levels. overall, only 2 patients presented a normal bmd; osteopenia and osteoporosis were noted in 41 (68.3%) and 17 (28.3%) individuals, respectively. low 25-ohd concentration was associated with a decreased bmd (b, 0.065, p = .029). there were no other demographic characteristics or clinical examinations associated with suboptimal vtd levels and bone loss. conclusion: suboptimal vtd status and bone loss were common in adult sbs even after weaning off pn. despite routine oral vtd supplementation, most patients did not achieve satisfactory status. this emphasizes the critical importance of routine surveillance of 25-ohd and bmd, as well as consideration of alternative methods of supplementation after weaning off pn.
osteoporosis	background and aims: lateral spine radiographs provide an inexpensive resource for characterizing abdominal aortic calcification (aac). a widely accepted measurement of aac is the semi-quantitative technique generated by the framingham heart study (f-aac-24). we sought to develop an analytical method to quantify acc (q(aac)) on lateral spine radiographs and compare the finding to conventional subjective measurements. methods: severity of aac was quantified by measuring pixel intensities in the user-defined region of the aorta with internal standardization to the vertebral endplates and background calibration to the density of the vertebral body. the association between bone mineral density (bmd) measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) and aac measured by q(aac), f-aac-24 and a modified framingham score (f-aac-12) was determined in 110 participants of the canadian multicenter osteoporosis study (camos). results: the inter-observer reliability for the q(aac) was slightly higher than with the visual and semi-quantitative framingham method and the pseudo-colored images illustrate the potential to meaningfully resolve severity of calcification. there was a significant negative association between q(aac) and bmd measures of the hip and spine. this association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, phosphate and hypertension. significant predictors of f-acc-12 and 24 included age and hypertension. conclusions: the q(aac) is a reproducible approach to measuring aac. whether it is capable of monitoring subtle calcific changes over time requires further study. this technique could be applied to large studies that seek to determine the impact of interventions that modify bone density as a treatment for vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease in the general population.(c) 2017 published by elsevier inc.
osteoporosis	chemotherapy is the most reliable treatment for osteoporosis and osseous metastases. to facilitate better drug delivery for bone treatments, a novel preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with high affinity to bone has been prepared. two-step synthesis of cholesteryl-functionalized poly(ethylene sodium phosphate) (ch-pepn(center dot)na) was performed via ring-opening polymerization of cyclic phosphoesters and the demethylation. the molecular weight of ch-pepn center dot na could be well controlled by changing the ratio of cholesterol and cyclic phosphoesters. because ch-pepn center dot na exhibits an amphiphilic nature in aqueous media, ch-pep..na-bearing nanoparticles (pep.na nps) were prepared by a solvent evaporation technique. the size of the nanoparticles investigated in the current study is approximately 100 nm, which was determined by dynamic light scattering (dls) and transmission electron microscopy (tem). due to the presence of highly water-soluble polymer chains, dispersion of pepn center dot na nps in aqueous media was stable for at least i week. hemolytic activity of pepn center dot na nps was found to be low and pepirna nps did not disintegrate mammalian cell membranes. additionally, cytotoxicity of pepn center dot na nps was not observed at concentrations below 100 p.,g/ml. the adsorption of pepn""na nps on hydroxyapatite (hap) microparticles was studied in comparison with poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (peg nps). both pepn center dot na nps and peg nps adsorbed well onto hap microparticles in distilled water with binding equilibrium constants (ichap) for pepn center dot na nps and peg nps of 3.6 x 10(6) and 7.9 x 10(6), respectively. in contrast, only pepn center dot na nps adsorbed onto hap microparticles in a saline phosphate buffer. moreover, the adsorption of pepn center dot na nps onto hap microparticles occurred even in the presence of 1.2 mm calcium ions or low-ph media. the affinity of the nanoparticles to bovine bone slices was also studied, with the result that large quantities of adsorbed pepn center dot na nps were observed on the slices by scanning electron microscope.

osteoporosis	study design: a retrospective study. summary of background data: complications of the bone cement used in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures have received increasingly more attention, especially for bone cement volume. objective: the aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the relationship between bone cement volume fraction and adjacent vertebral fracture (avf) after unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (pkp). materials and methods: between 2006 and 2011, 495 patients with single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (ovcf) were surgically treated by unilateral pkp and had completed 12-month follow-up in our hospital. according to the new ovcf, they were divided into 3 groups: avf group, non-avf group, and normal group (who were not new ovcf). on the basis of the value of the plain radiography, the cement volume fraction for the vertebral body was calculated, and cement leakage, bone mineral density, visual analog scale, and cobb angle of preoperative and postoperative were analyzed. results: during the follow-up, 110 (22.2%) patients had new ovcf, and others were normal (n=385). fifty-two cases were avf and 58 were non-avf. the cement volume fraction of avf group, non-avf group, and normal group were 32.5% +/- 5.5%, 27.3% +/- 1.8%, and 27.1% +/- 2.6%, respectively. the 95% confidence interval of volume fraction were (31.0, 34.1), (26.8, 27.7), and (26.9, 28.5), respectively. the avf group showed higher cement volume fraction in 3 groups (p0.05). there were 19 (36.5%) patients with cement leakage in avf group, 12 (20.7%) in non-avf group, and 68 (17.7%) in normal group. the avf group showed higher cement leakage (p < 0.05). compared with avf group and normal group, non-avf group had lower bone mineral density in preoperation. all groups reported significantly improved visual analog scale scores and cobb angle on the day of surgery. however, there were no significant difference between the 3 groups. conclusions: unilateral pkp is an effective and safe procedure for patients with ovcf. however, cement volume should be determined in terms of the vertebral body fraction to obtain a favorable outcome. the risk of avf and cement leakage will increase obviously with the cement volume fraction increased. we recommend that a bone cement volume fraction of about one fourth is suitable for unilateral pkp.
osteoporosis	currently, the use of stem cell transplantation for the treatment of osteoporosis is a popular research topic. in general, promotion of the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells is the goal of researchers. micrornas (mirnas of mirs) are critical regulatory factors of osteogenic induction, and mir-9 and mir-10 have been substantiated to be involved in the osteogenic process, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. the present study investigated the role of mir-9 and mir-10 in the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bmscs) and aimed to elucidate the mechanism of osteogenic differentiation. using mtt assay and rt-pcr, we found that mir-9 expression was upregulated and mir-10 expression was downregulated during osteogenic differentiation. moreover, as shown by the results of mineralization analysis and western blot analysis, the overexpression of mir-9 enhanced the osteogenic abilities and overexpression of mir-9 inhibited these abilities. furthermore, mir-9 and mir-10 also affected the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (runx2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathway by western blot analysis. based on these results, we conclude that mir-9 and mir-10 play key roles in regulating the differentiation of bmscs.
osteoporosis	objective. increasing evidence has suggested an association between sleep duration and osteoporosis risk, although the results of previous studies have been inconsistent. to our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of the literature and quantitative estimates of the association between sleep duration and risk of osteoporosis in population-based studies of middle aged and elderly women. methods. pertinent studies were identified by searching pubmed and embase databases up to february 2016. five out of six included studies were cross-sectional and one was a prospective cohort study. they included 72,326 participants from three different countries. we extracted 31,625 individuals in these studies for our meta-analysis. results. a pooled odds ratio analysis in women between 40 to 86 years indicated that there is an inverse relationship between sleep duration and osteoporosis (overall or =1.07 95% ci: 1.00-1.15). the negative association of long sleep duration (8 h or more per day) with osteoporosis risk was observed in middle aged and elderly women (or =1.22, 95% ci: 1.06-1.38) but not in women with short sleep duration (7 h or less per day) (or =0.98, 95% ci: 0.90-1.05). conclusion. this meta-analysis suggests that long sleep duration (8 h or more per day) may be associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis in middle-aged and elderly. further prospective cohort studies with longer follow-up periods, valid instruments for measurement of sleep duration and dynamic sleep quality are warranted to support the possible relationship between sleep duration and osteoporosis risk in women.

osteoporosis	objective: to evaluate the effects of osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoid (giop) on bone tissue of rats with experimental periodontitis (ep). design: 48 male wistar rats divided into groups: naive, ep, giop and giop + er rats of giop and giop + ep groups received 7 mg/kg of dexamethasone intramuscularly once a week for 5 weeks. following, ep and giop + ep groups were subjected to ligature-induced periodontitis. naive group experienced no manipulation. after 11 days, the animals were euthanized and left maxillae collected for macroscopic, radiographic, micro-tomographic and microscopic analysis of alveolar bone loss (abl). blood samples were collected for determination of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (balp) levels and the right femurs were removed for radiographic and biomechanical analysis. results: ep caused abl and reduced balp levels (p < 0,05), but it did not change the architecture or biomechanics of femur, compared to naive. giop did not cause abl, but it significantly decreased alveolar bone mineral density (abmd), bone percentage and trabecular thickness (tb.th) and increased alveolar bone porosity (p < 0.05) and significantly reduced balp serum levels, as well as radiographic density and young 's module of femur, compared to naive. there was a greater abl in group giop + ep when compared to ep (p < 0.05). giop + ep caused a greater decrease on abmd, tb.th, bone percentage and increased bone porosity (p < 0.05) and also presented a significant reduction in balp levels (p < 0.05), in radiographic density and in young 's module of femur compared to ep (p < 0.05). conclusions: giop can potentiate the destructive effects of ep on alveolar bone and alter the systemic bone loss, by promoting bone resorption and reducing osteoblast activity.

osteoporosis	objectives maternal nutrition during pregnancy plays an important role in predisposing offspring to the development of chronic disease in adulthood, including osteoporosis. our aim was to investigate maternal dietary intakes during pregnancy, with a focus on nutrients important for skeletal development in the offspring. methods in this case-control study, cases were pregnant women recruited for the vitamin d in pregnancy study (n = 350, age 20-40 years) and controls were non-pregnant peers participating in the geelong osteoporosis study (n = 305, age 20-40 years). dietary intakes of nutrients were quantified using a validated food frequency questionnaire. results compared to controls, cases consumed more energy [median (interquartile range): 7831 (6506-9461) vs. 7136 (6112-8785) kj/day]; median intakes for cases were greater for carbohydrates [206.2 (172.5-249.9) vs. 188.2 (147.7-217.5) g/day], fat [77.9 (60.3-96.6) vs. 72.1 (53.3-87.4) g/day], potassium [2860 (2363-3442) vs. 2606 (2166-3442) mg/day] and calcium [1022 (819-1264) vs. 918 (782-1264) mg/day] (all p <= 0.05). however, pregnant women were not consuming greater amounts of those nutrients which had an increased demand (protein, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc). similarly, this translated to the likelihood of achieving national recommendations for corresponding nutrients. conclusions for practice compared to their non-pregnant peers, pregnant women were more likely to meet dietary recommendations for calcium and potassium; however, this was not the pattern observed for protein, magnesium and zinc. future public health messages should perhaps focus on increasing awareness of the importance of all these nutrients during pregnancy.
medicare	objectives: to assess in veterans with spinal cord injury (sci) or amputated limb (al) the following: (1) patient demographics, medical factors, cultural and psychosocial characteristic by race; (2) wheelchair quality by race; and (3) the independent associations of patient race and the other factors with wheelchair quality. design: cross-sectional cohort study. setting: three department of veterans affairs (va) medical centers affiliated with academic medical centers. participants: eligible participants were veterans with sci or als (n=516); 482 of them completed the interview. analyses were restricted to white and african american participants. because there was no variation in wheelchair quality among al patients (n=42), they were excluded from all but descriptive analyses, leading to a final sample size of 421. interventions: not applicable. main outcome measure: wheelchair quality as defined by the medicare healthcare common procedure coding system. results: we found race differences in many of our variables, but not in quality for manual (odds ratio [or] = .67; 95% confidence interval [ci], .33-1.36) or power (or=.82; 95% ci,.51-1.34) wheelchairs. several factors including age (or= .96; 95% ci, .93-.99) and income (or=3.78; 95% ci, 1.43-9.97) were associated with wheelchair quality. there were no significant associations of cultural or psychosocial factors with wheelchair quality. conclusions: although there were no racial differences in wheelchair quality, we found a significant association of older age and lower income with poorer wheelchair quality among veterans. efforts are needed to raise awareness of such disparities among va wheelchair providers and to take steps to eliminate these disparities in prescription practice across va sites. published by elsevier inc. on behalf of the american congress of rehabilitation medicine
medicare	purpose: in implementing the merit-based incentive payment system (mips), cms will provide special considerations to physicians with infrequent face-to-face patient encounters by reweighting mips performance categories to account for the unique circumstances facing these providers. the aim of this study was to determine the impact of varying criteria on the fraction of radiologists who are likely to receive special considerations for performance assessment under mips. methods: data from the 2014 medicare physician and other supplier file for 28,710 diagnostic radiologists were used to determine the fraction of radiologists meeting various proposed criteria for receiving special considerations. for each definition, the fraction of patient facing encounters among all billed codes was determined for those radiologists not receiving special considerations. results: when using the criterion proposed by cms that physicians will receive special considerations if billing <= 25 evaluation and management services or surgical codes, 72.0% of diagnostic radiologists would receive special considerations, though such encounters would represent only 2.1% of billed codes among remaining diagnostic radiologists without special considerations. if cms were to apply an alternative criterion of billing <= 100 evaluation and management codes exclusively, 98.8% of diagnostic radiologists would receive special considerations. at this threshold, patient-facing encounters would represent approximately 10% of billed codes among remaining radiologists without special considerations. conclusions: the current cms proposed criterion for special considerations would result in a considerable fraction of radiologists being evaluated on the basis of measures that are not reflective of their practice and beyond their direct control. alternative criteria could help ensure that radiologists are provided a fair opportunity for success in performance review under the mips.

medicare	objective: to study differences in imaging utilization downstream to initial emergency department (ed) ultrasound examinations interpreted by radiologists versus nonradiologists. methods: using 5% medicare research identifiable files from 2009 to 2014, we identified episodes where the place of service was ""emergency room hospital"" and the patient also underwent an ultrasound examination. we determined whether the initial ultrasound was interpreted by a radiologist or nonradiologist and then summed all additional imaging events occurring within 7, 14, and 30 days of each initial ed ultrasound. for each year and each study window, we calculated the mean number of downstream imaging procedures by specialty group. results: of 200,357 ed ultrasound events, 163,569 (81.6%) were interpreted by radiologists and 36,788 (18.4%) by nonradiologists. across all study years, ed patients undergoing ultrasound examinations interpreted by nonradiologists underwent 1.08, 1.22, and 1.34 additional diagnostic imaging studies at 7, 14, and 30 days, respectively (p <.01) compared with when the initial ultrasound examination was interpreted by a radiologist. from 2010 to 2014, the volume of downstream imaging for both radiologists and non radiologists significantly decreased, with each year resulting in 0.08 fewer imaging examinations (p <.001) 14 days after the ed ultrasound event. despite that decline, differences in downstream imaging between radiologists and nonradiologists persisted over rime. conclusion: downstream imaging after an initial ed ultrasound is significantly reduced when the ultrasound examination is interpreted by a radiologist rather than a nonradiologist.
medicare	aim: the aim of this article is to evaluate the clinical and cost implications of failed endoscopic hemostasis in patients with gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding. methods: a retrospective claims analysis of the medicare provider analysis and review (medpar) file was conducted to identify all hospitalizations for gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding in the year 2012. the main outcome measures were to compare all-cause mortality, total length of hospital stay (los), hospital costs and payment between patients managed with one upper gastrointestinal (ugi) endoscopy versus more than one ugi endoscopy or requiring interventional radiology-guided hemostasis (irh) or surgery after failed endoscopic attempt. results: the medpar claims data evaluated 13,501 hospitalizations, of which 12,242 (90.6%) reported one ugi endoscopy, 817 (6.05%) reported >1 ugi endoscopy, 303 (2.24%) reported irh after failed endoscopy and 139 (1.03%) reported surgeries after failed endoscopy. all cause-mortality was significantly lower for patients who underwent only one ugi endoscopy (3%) compared to patients requiring >1 endoscopy (6%), irh (9%) or surgery (14%), p1 endoscopy (eight days), irh (nine days) or surgery (15 days), p1 endoscopy ($20,055), irh ($34,730) or surgery ($47,589), p < 0.0001. conclusions: failure to achieve hemostasis at the index endoscopy has significant clinical and cost implications. when feasible, a repeat endoscopy must be attempted followed by irh. surgery should preferably be reserved as a last resort for patients who fail other treatment measures.
medicare	objectiveto measure variation in payment rates under medicare 's inpatient prospective payment system (ipps) and identify the main payment adjustments that drive variation. data sources/study settingmedicare cost reports for all medicare-certified hospitals, 1987-2013, and dartmouth atlas geographic files. study designwe measure the medicare payment rate as a hospital 's total acute inpatient medicare part a payment, divided by the standard ipps payment for its geographic area. we assess variation using several measures, both within local markets and nationally. we perform a factor decomposition to identify the share of variation attributable to specific adjustments. we also describe the characteristics of hospitals receiving different payment rates and evaluate changes in the magnitude of the main adjustments over time. data collection/extraction methodsdata downloaded from the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the national bureau of economic research, and the dartmouth atlas. principal findingsin 2013, medicare paid for acute inpatient discharges at a rate 31 percent above the ipps base. for the top 10 percent of discharges, the mean rate was double the ipps base. variations were driven by adjustments for medical education and care to low-income populations. the magnitude of variation has increased over time. conclusionsadjustments are a large and growing share of medicare hospital payments, and they create significant variation in payment rates.
medicare	objective the comparative effectiveness of the 2 treatment options surgical clipping and endovascular coiling for unruptured cerebral aneurysms remains an issue of debate and has not been studied in clinical trials. the authors investigated the association between treatment method for unruptured cerebral aneurysms and outcomes in elderly patients. methods the authors performed a cohort study of 100% of medicare fee-for-service claims data for elderly patients who had treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms between 2007 and 2012. to control for measured confounding, the authors used propensity score conditioning and inverse probability weighting with mixed effects to account for clustering at the level of the hospital referral region (hrr). an instrumental variable (regional rates of coiling) analysis was used to control for unmeasured confounding and to create pseudo-randomization on the treatment method. results during the study period, 8705 patients underwent treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms and met the study inclusion criteria. of these patients, 2585 (29.7%) had surgical clipping and 6120 (70.3%) had endovascular coiling. instrumental variable analysis demonstrated no difference between coiling and clipping in 1-year postoperative mortality (or 1.25, 95% ci 0.68-2.31) or 90-day readmission rate (or 1.04, 95% ci 0.66-1.62). however, clipping was associated with a greater likelihood of discharge to rehabilitation (or 6.39, 95% ci 3.85-10.59) and 3.6 days longer length of stay (los; 95% ci 2.90-4.71). the same associations were present in propensity score adjusted and inverse probability weighted models. conclusions in a cohort of medicare patients, there was no difference in mortality and the readmission rate between clipping and coiling of unruptured cerebral aneurysms. clipping was associated with a higher rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility and a longer los.
medicare	background total hip arthroplasty (tha) is very frequently performed. despite low complication rates, revisions play an important clinical and economical role. the aim of this study was to identify comorbid diseases of patients undergoing primary tha and their potential influence on the survival of hip replacements. patients/material and methods a total of 867 patients were included in this retrospective study. all revisions were reviewed that took place at our hospital within one year of primary implantation of tha. comorbid diseases were detected by administrative data, using the elixhauser definition, which includes thirty diseases. the cox regression model and fisher 's exact test were used to examine correlations between comorbidities and risk of revision. results 41 patients required re-operation within the first year of surgery. the presence of one or more of the analysed comorbidities was associated with a greater risk of revision. deficiency anemia, obesity, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, fluid and electrolyte disorders and peripheral vascular disorders were associated with increased risk of revision (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). conclusion: the total number of comorbidities and specific comorbid diseases was independently associated with an increased risk of re-operation within the first year of total hip arthroplasty. this information could be helpful in pre- and post-operative risk adjustment and patient selection.
medicare	purpose: frailty and functional status have emerged as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing cancer surgery. to articulate the impact on value (ie quality per cost), we compared perioperative outcomes and expenditures according to patient function for older adults undergoing kidney cancer surgery. materials and methods: using linked seer (surveillance, epidemiology and end results)-medicare data, we identified 19,129 elderly patients with kidney cancer treated with nonablative surgery from 2000 to 2009. we quantified patient function using function related indicators (claims indicative of dysfunction and disability) and measured 30-day morbidity, mortality, resource use and cost. using multivariable, mixed effects models to adjust for patient and hospital characteristics, we estimated the relationship of patient functionality with both treatment outcomes and expenditures. results: of 19,129 patients we identified 5,509 (28.8%) and 3,127 (16.4%) with a function related indicator count of 1 and 2 or greater, respectively. while surgical complications did not vary (or 0.95, 95% ci 0.86-1.05), patients with 2 or more indicators more often experienced a medical event (or 1.22, 95% ci 1.10-1.36) or a geriatric event (or 1.55, 95% ci 1.33-1.81), or died within 30 days of surgery (or 1.43, 95% ci 1.10-1.86) compared with patients with no baseline dysfunction. these patients utilized significantly more medical resources and amassed higher acute care expenditures (p < 0.001). conclusions: during kidney cancer surgery, patients in poor functional health can face a more eventful medical recovery at elevated cost, indicating lower value care. greater consideration of frailty and functional status during treatment planning and transitions may represent areas for value enhancement in kidney cancer and urology care.
medicare	we explored the epidemiology and outcomes of clostridium difficile infection (cdi) recurrence among medicare patients in a nursing home (nh) whose cdi originated in acute care hospitals. we conducted a retrospective, population-based matched cohort combining medicare claims with minimum data set 3.0, including all hospitalized patients age >= 65 years transferred to an nh after hospitalization with cdi 1/2011-11/2012. incident cdi was defined as icd-9-cm code 008.45 with no others in prior 60 days. cdi recurrence was defined as (within 60 days of last day of cdi treatment): oral metronidazole, oral vancomycin, or fidaxomicin for >= 3 days in part d file; or an icd-9-cm code for cdi (008.45) during a rehospitalization. cox proportional hazards and linear models, adjusted for age, gender, race, and comorbidities, examined mortality within 60 days and excess hospital days and costs, in patients with recurrent cdi compared to those without. among 14,472 survivors of index cdi hospitalization discharged to an nh, 4775 suffered a recurrence. demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar, as was the risk of death (24.2% with vs 24.4% without). median number of hospitalizations was 2 (iqr 1-3) among those with and 0 (iqr 0-1) among those without recurrence. adjusted excess hospital days per patient were 20.3 (95% ci 19.1-21.4) and medicare reimbursements $12,043 (95% ci $11,469-$12,617) in the group with a recurrence. although recurrent cdi did not increase the risk of death, it was associated with a far higher risk of rehospitalization, excess hospital days, and costs to medicare.
medicare	background. tens of millions of seniors are at risk of herpes zoster (hz) and its complications. live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (hzv) reduces that risk, although questions regarding effectiveness and durability of protection in routine clinical practice remain. we used medicare data to investigate hzv effectiveness (ve) and its durability. methods. this retrospective cohort study included beneficiaries ages >= 65 years during january 2007 through july 2014. multiple adjustments to account for potential bias were made. hzv-vaccinated beneficiaries were matched to unvaccinated beneficiaries (primary analysis) and to hzv-unvaccinated beneficiaries who had received pneumococcal vaccination (secondary analysis). hz outcomes in community and hospital settings were analyzed, including ophthalmic zoster (oz) and postherpetic neuralgia (phn). results. among eligible beneficiaries (average age 77 years), the primary analysis found ve for community hz of 33% (95% ci: 32%-35%) and 19% (95% ci: 17%-22%), for the first 3, and subsequent 4+ years postvaccination, respectively. in the secondary analysis, ve was, respectively, 37% (95% ci: 36%-39%) and 22% (95% ci: 20%-25%). in the primary analysis, ve for phn was 57% (95% ci: 52%-61%) and 45% (95% ci: 36%-53%) in the first 3 and subsequent 4+ years, respectively; ve for hospitalized hz was, respectively, 74% (95% ci: 67%-79%) and 55% (95% ci: 39%-67%). differences in ve by age group were not significant. conclusions. in both the primary and secondary analyses, hzv provided protection against hz across all ages, but effectiveness declined over time. ve was higher and better preserved over time for phn and hz-associated hospitalizations than for community hz.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective. to study the effect of the presence of fibromyalgia (fm) on common clinical disease activity indices in patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa). methods. seventy-three consecutive outpatients with psa (mean age 51.7 yrs; 42 females, 57.5%) were enrolled in a prospective cross-sectional study. fm was determined according to american college of rheumatism criteria (2010 and 1990). all patients underwent clinical evaluation of disease activity and completed the health assessment questionnaire (haq), the bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai), the dermatology life quality index, and the leeds enthesitis index (lei). disease activity was evaluated using the composite psoriatic disease activity index (cpdai), minimal disease activity (mda), and the disease activity index for psoriatic arthritis (dapsa) scores. results. the overall prevalence of fm was 17.8% (13 patients), and all but 1 were women (12 patients, 92.3%, p = 0.005). cpdai and dapsa scores were significantly higher in patients with coexisting psa and fm (9.23 +/- 1.92 and 27.53 +/- 19.23, respectively) than in patients with psa only (4.25 +/- 3.14 and 12.82 +/- 12.71, respectively; p < 0.001 and p = 0.003). none of the patients with fm + psa met the criteria for mda, whereas 26 psa-only patients did (43.3%, p = 0.003). haq, basdai, and lei scores were significantly worse in patients with psa and associated fm. conclusion. coexisting fm is related to worse scores on all tested measures in patients with psa. its influence should be taken into consideration in the treatment algorithm to avoid unnecessary upgrading of treatment.
psoriatic_arthritis	objectives: patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) are at an elevated risk for the development of coronary artery disease, but the risk cerebrovascular disease among these patients remains incompletely understood. we investigated the cerebrovascular risk profiles of patients with a cerebrovascular disease and as and compared these profiles to those of cerebrovascular disease patients without as. methods: we retrospectively analysed 34 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease also diagnosed with as and 597 controls without as with respect to patient age, gender, cerebrovascular risk factors, and laboratory test results. results: as patients were significantly younger than control patients in this study (56.2 +/- 13.5 years vs. 63.0 +/- 13.4 years, respectively; p=0.004). logistic regression analysis did not indicate significant relationships between gender, cerebrovascular risk factors, and biochemical risk factors in as patients, nor were any significant relationships found between erythrocyte sedimentation rate or c-reactive protein and biochemical risk factors. a low frequency of large-artery atherosclerosis and high frequency of small-vessel occlusion according to trial of org 10172 in acute stroke treatment (toast) classification were found in as patients with stroke. conclusions: among the population included in this study, patients with as sought treatment for cerebrovascular disease were at a younger age compared to control patients without as. thus, our results indicate that as patients have an increased risk for the premature onset of cerebrovascular disease. and the premature atherosclerosis may associate with the patients with as. furthermore, the high frequency of the small-vessel stroke subtype in as patients indicates that small-vessel inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases in as patients. further prospective study with more samples will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.
psoriatic_arthritis	psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disorder which manifests as dermatologic lesions, and psoriatic arthritis (psa) in about 30% of cases. psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular events, obesity and psychiatric disorders, which can all affect the course of sleep disorders. a systematic review of the literature on the relationship between psoriasis, psa, and formal sleep disorders identified 33 studies. there is an increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (osa) with 36%-81.8% prevalence in psoriasis versus 2%-4% in the general population. there was also an increase in the prevalence of restless legs syndrome of 15.1%-18% in psoriasis versus 5%-10% in european and north american samples. the wide variety of insomnia criteria used in studies resulted in an insomnia prevalence of 5.9%-44.8% in psoriasis, which is insufficient to show an elevated prevalence when the general population has a 10% prevalence of chronic insomnia and 30-35% prevalence of transient insomnia. there is evidence that symptoms of insomnia in psoriasis are directly mediated by pruritus and pain. treatments that decrease the cutaneous symptoms in psoriasis were successful in mitigating insomnia, but did not show improvements in osa where the relationship with psoriasis is multifactorial.

psoriatic_arthritis	multistate processes provide a convenient framework when interest lies in characterising the transition intensities between a set of defined states. if, however, there is an unobserved event of interest (not known if and when the event occurs), which when it occurs stops future transitions in the multistate process from occurring, then drawing inference from the joint multistate and event process can be problematic. in health studies, a particular example of this could be resolution, where a resolved patient can no longer experience any further symptoms, and this is explored here for illustration. a multistate model that includes the state space of the original multistate process but partitions the state representing absent symptoms into a latent absorbing resolved state and a temporary transient state of absent symptoms is proposed. the expanded state space explicitly distinguishes between resolved and temporary spells of absent symptoms through disjoint states and allows the uncertainty of not knowing if resolution has occurred to be easily captured when constructing the likelihood; observations of absent symptoms can be considered to be temporary or having resulted from resolution. the proposed methodology is illustrated on a psoriatic arthritis data set where the outcome of interest is a set of intermittently observed disability scores. estimated probabilities of resolving are also obtained from the model.

psoriatic_arthritis	il-17 cytokines are expressed by a variety of cells and mediate host defence against extracellular pathogens. il-17 is upregulated at sites of inflammation and can synergize with other cytokines, such as tnf-alpha, to amplify the inflammatory response. activation of these signalling pathways has been hypothesized to contribute to the underlying pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, ra, psa and asthma. thus the il-17 signalling pathway is an attractive target for the development of therapeutic agents to modulate aberrant inflammatory responses. this review of the clinical development of therapeutic agents that target il-17 signalling pathways in inflammatory diseases focuses on brodalumab, a human anti-il-17 receptor a mab. the cumulative findings of early clinical studies with anti-il-17 agents, including brodalumab, secukinumab and ixekizumab, provide strong evidence for the role of il-17 signalling in the pathophysiology of certain inflammatory diseases and support the potential use of these agents in treating these diseases.
psoriatic_arthritis	this chapter describes the involvement of the lung in systemic inflammatory joint disease (ud) with a particular focus on rheumatoid arthritis, although the topics of pulmonary involvement in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis are also addressed. interstitial lung disease is the most lethal pulmonary complication of ud and the chapter describes recent advances in both our understanding of this complication and the therapeutic options that offer real hope for improved outcomes. although less well recognised, airways disease is just as common and its association with ud is described in some detail, with a section devoted to the recent surge in interest in bronchiectasis. acute pulmonary infection is common in ud and its management is reviewed in some detail. although pleural disease is less common than it once was, its treatment is explored. we conclude by reviewing the relationship between the drug therapies employed in ud and their effects on the lung. crown copyright (c) 2016 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
psoriatic_arthritis	tnf inhibitors have been used in psoriasis (pso) and psoriatic arthritis (psa), which were associated with increased risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular events. however, whether tnf inhibitors reduce cardiovascular event is still unclear. therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of tnf inhibitors on adverse cardiovascular events (cves) in pso with or without psa. we undertook a meta-analysis of clinical trials identified in systematic searches of medline, embase, wanfang database, cochrane database, and google scholar through december 31, 2015. five studies (49,795 patients) were included. overall, compared with topical/photo treatment, tnf inhibitors were associated with a significant lower risk of cve (rr, 0.58; 95 % ci, 0.43 to 0.77; p < 0.001; i (2) = 66.2 %). additionally, compared with methotrexate (mtx) treatment, risk of cve was also markedly decreased in the tnf inhibitor group (rr, 0.67; 95 % ci, 0.52 to 0.88; p = 0.003; i (2) = 9.3 %). meanwhile, tnf inhibitors were linked to reduced incidence of myocardial infarction compared with topical/photo or mtx treatment (rr, 0.73; 95 % ci, 0.59 to 0.90; p = 0.003; i (2) = 56.2 % and rr, 0.65; 95 % ci, 0.48 to 0.89; p = 0.007; i (2) = 0.0 %, respectively). furthermore, there was a trend of decreased rate of mortality in the tnf inhibitor group compared with other therapy (rr, 0.90; 95 % ci, 0.54 to 1.50; p = 0.68; i (2) = 70.9 %). tnf inhibitors appear to have net clinical benefits with regard to adverse cardiovascular events in pso and/or psa. rigorous randomized controlled trials will need to evaluate whether tnf inhibitors truly result in reduction of cardiovascular diseases.
psoriatic_arthritis	background: patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa) experience functional impairment and reduced quality of life, and thus patient global assessment in psa is explained mainly by the physical, but also by the psychological, aspect of the disease. to assess the prevalence of minimal disease activity (mda) in spanish patients with psa, we examined their characteristics and the association between mda and the impact of the disease as assessed by the psa impact of disease (psaid) questionnaire. methods: a cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in patients who fulfilled the classification for psoriatic arthritis (caspar) criteria with at least 1 year of disease duration, and who were treated with biological or conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) according to routine clinical practice in spain. patients were considered in mda if they met at least 5/7 of the mda criteria. the association between mda and the recently developed psaid questionnaire was also recorded. results: of 227 patients included, 133 (58.6%) were in the mda state (52% with antitumor necrosis factor (anti-tnf) a monotherapy, 24% with csdmard monotherapy, and 24% with anti-tnf alpha in combination with csdmard). using multivariate logistic regression analysis, male gender (odds ratio (or) 2.74, p = 0.001), a sedentary lifestyle (or 3.13, p = 0.002), familial history of psa (or 0.38, p = 0.036), c-reactive protein (crp) level (or 0.92, p = 0.010), and use of corticoids (or 0.33, p = 0.007) were considered features related to mda. mda patients had a significantly lower impact of the disease according to psaid (mean total score (sd): mda 3.3 (3.1) vs. non-mda 7.1 (5.2); p < 0.001). conclusions: nearly 60% of spanish psa patients achieve mda in routine clinical practice. mda remains one of the most useful therapeutic targets for psa since patients who reached this state also had a significantly lower impact of disease according to psaid.
psoriatic_arthritis	differentiation between psoriatic arthritis (psa) sine psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (ra) may be a challenge, especially in the early stages, hence the need for new instrumental markers to assist their diagnosis. in this study, we investigated possible dermoscopic differences in vascular appearance of nail fold and elbow (a classic site of repeated trauma) in these two conditions. fifteen patients with psa sine psoriasis, 12 patients with ra and 12 controls were included in the study. regarding the nail fold vascular appearance in psa sine psoriasis and ra cohorts, the presence of diffuse reddish background with or without sparse dotted vessels was significant in the former, whereas the evidence of parallel dotted/short linear vessels (fish school-like pattern) or irregular/ramified, blurry, purple vessels were significant in the latter; none of these patterns were detected in the control group. regarding the elbow, the pattern significantly associated with psa sine psoriasis consisted of diffusely distributed, red, dotted vessels. on the other hand, ra patients and controls displayed similar dermoscopic findings, with three possible vascular patterns being observed: (i) irregular, blurry, purple vessels; (ii) avascular appearance; and (iii) sparse, dotted, purple vessels. in conclusion, dermoscopy may be a useful supportive tool for differentiating early psa sine psoriasis from ra.
psoriatic_arthritis	the structure and physiological state of the local white adipose tissue (wat) located underneath the lesional psoriatic skin and inside of the joints affected by psoriatic arthritis play an important role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. wat pads associated with inflammatory sites in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are, correspondingly, dermal wat and articular adipose tissue; these pads demonstrate inflammatory phenotypes in both diseases. such local wat inflammation could be the primary effect in the pathophysiology of psoriasis leading to the modification of the local expression of adipokines, a change in the structure of the basement membrane and the release of keratinocytes with consequent epidermal hyperproliferation during psoriasis. similar articular adipose tissue inflammation can lead to the induction of structural modifications and synovial inflammation in the joints of patients with psoriatic arthritis.
addiction	dysfunction of the orbitofrontal (ofc) and anterior cingulate (acc) cortices has been linked with several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and addiction. these conditions are also associated with abnormalities in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the white matter (wm) bundle carrying ascending and descending fibers from the ofc and acc. furthermore, deep-brain stimulation (dbs) for psychiatric disorders targets these fibers. experiments in rats provide essential information on the mechanisms of normal and abnormal brain anatomy, including wm composition and perturbations. however, whereas descending prefrontal cortex (pfc) fibers in primates form a well defined and topographic anterior limb of the internal capsule, the specific locations and organization of these fibers in rats is unknown. we address this gap by analyzing descending fibers from injections of an anterograde tracer in the rat acc and ofc. our results show that the descending pfc fibers in the rat form wm fascicles embedded within the striatum. these bundles are arranged topographically and contain projections, not only to the striatum, but also to the thalamus and brainstem. they can therefore be viewed as the rat homolog of the primate anterior limb of the internal capsule. furthermore, mapping these projections allows us to identify the fibers likely to be affected by experimental manipulations of the striatum and the anterior limb of the internal capsule. these results are therefore essential for translating abnormalities of human wm and effects of dbs to rodent models.
addiction	objective: internet gaming disorder (igd) is a type of behavioral addiction characterized by abnormal executive control, leading to loss of control over excessive gaming. attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is one of the most common comorbid disorders in igd, involving delayed development of the executive control system, which could predispose individuals to gaming addiction. we investigated the influence of childhood adhd on neural network features of igd. methods: resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis was performed on 44 young, male igd subjects with and without childhood adhd and 19 age-matched, healthy male controls. posterior cingulate cortex (pcc)-seeded connectivity was evaluated to assess abnormalities in default mode network (dmn) connectivity, which is associated with deficits in executive control. results: igd subjects without childhood adhd showed expanded functional connectivity (fc) between dmn-related regions (pcc, medial prefrontal cortex, thalamus) compared with controls. these subjects also exhibited expanded fc between the pcc and brain regions implicated in salience processing (anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex) compared with igd subjects with childhood adhd. igd subjects with childhood adhd showed expanded fc between the pcc and cerebellum (crus ii), a region involved in executive control. the strength of connectivity between the pcc and cerebellum (crus ii) was positively correlated with self-reporting scales reflecting impulsiveness. conclusion: individuals with igd showed altered pcc-based fc, the characteristics of which might be dependent upon history of childhood adhd. our findings suggest that altered neural networks for executive control in adhd would be a predisposition for developing igd.

addiction	objectivewe compared the prevalence of receiving depression care between adults with past-year major depressive episodes (depressed) and substance use disorders (sud) in the united states and their depressed counterparts without sud. methoddata were from 25,500 adults who participated in the 2008-2014 national surveys on drug use and health. descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were applied. resultsduring 2008-2014, approximately 55.4% of depressed u.s. adults with sud received past-year depression care, while 60.1% of depressed adults without sud received such care. overall, co-occurring sud was associated with an 8% decreased likelihood of receiving past-year depression care (risk ratio (rr) = 0.92, 95% ci = 0.89-0.96). for depressed adults with severe functional impairment, co-occurring sud was associated with a 9% decreased likelihood of receiving past-year depression care (rr = 0.91, 95% ci = 0.87-0.95). for depressed men, co-occurring sud was associated with a 13% decreased likelihood of receiving past-year depression care (rr= 0.87, 95% ci = 0.81-0.94). the following depressed adults were at increased risk of not receiving depression care: those without functional impairment, without suicidal ideation, and without physical comorbidities, aged 18-29, male, racial/ethnic minorities, having less than high school education, uninsured, and never married. conclusionsamong depressed adults in the united states, comorbid sud modestly but significantly decreases the likelihood of receiving past-year depression care. depressed young adults, men, racial/ethnic minorities, less educated individuals, uninsured adults, and never married adults are also at increased risk for not receiving depression care. outreach efforts are needed to broaden access to depression care for these underserved adults.
addiction	liposomes are natural vesicles generally based on phosphatidylcholine (pc). the optimization of the lipid bilayer composition with the addition of little percentages of natural lipids is still at early stage due to the difficulties experienced by classical liposome formation processes, mainly, in reproducibility and encapsulation efficiency. supercritical assisted liposome formation (superlip) has demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome. therefore, in this work, this process has been tested to produce liposomes of controlled nanometric diameter and the effect of water solution flow rate on drug encapsulation efficiency was investigated. the addition of cholesterol (chol) or phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) was also studied to gain the control on the release rate of the drug entrapped in liposomes. theophylline was selected as the model hydrophilic drug. using superlip process, pc/chol and pc/pe liposomes were successfully produced with nanometric mean diameters down to 200 nm. optimization of both lipid composition and superlip operative parameters allowed to obtain theophylline encapsulation efficiencies up to 98%. drug release kinetics were affected by liposome composition, in particular, the addiction of chol and pe allowed to slow down theophylline release rate. these results confirmed the possibility of producing liposomes with a complex architecture of the lipid membrane using the superlip process.

addiction	historically, recovery from substance use disorders (sud) has focused exclusively on the use or non-use of the addictive substance(s). more recently, samsha [1] has defined recovery in a more holistic way, using quality of life (qol) as a measure of recovery for individuals with substance use and mental health disorders. however, little is known about the myriad experiences that inform and affect qol for individuals with substance use disorders. using an attachment informed stress-buffering framework, the purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of parental warmth and recovery support to qol among women in substance abuse treatment. linear regression and bootstrapping were used to examine direct and mediated effects of parental warmth and recovery support on qol among 318 women recruited from three inner-city women-only addiction treatment programs. relationships were assessed across three domains of quality of life: physical, psychological, and social. parental warmth and recovery support were directly associated with psychological and social qol, when controlling for the influence of trauma symptoms. recovery support mediated the relationship between parental warmth and qol across psychological and social qol domains. findings suggest that interventions that focus on attachment-related constructs to enhance recovery support may improve quality of life among women with sud.
addiction	online social networking sites (snss) have gained increasing popularity in the last decade, with individuals engaging in snss to connect with others who share similar interests. the perceived need to be online may result in compulsive use of snss, which in extreme cases may result in symptoms and consequences traditionally associated with substance-related addictions. in order to present new insights into online social networking and addiction, in this paper, 10 lessons learned concerning online social networking sites and addiction based on the insights derived from recent empirical research will be presented. these are: (i) social networking and social media use are not the same; (ii) social networking is eclectic; (iii) social networking is a way of being; (iv) individuals can become addicted to using social networking sites; (v) facebook addiction is only one example of sns addiction; (vi) fear of missing out (fomo) may be part of sns addiction; (vii) smartphone addiction may be part of sns addiction; (viii) nomophobia may be part of sns addiction; (ix) there are sociodemographic differences in sns addiction; and (x) there are methodological problems with research to date. these are discussed in turn. recommendations for research and clinical applications are provided.
addiction	alcohol dependence (ad) is characterized by corticostriatal impairments in individual brain areas such as the striatum. as yet however, complex brain network topology in ad and its association with disease progression are unknown. we applied graph theory to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fmri) to examine weighted global efficiency and local (clustering coefficient, degree and eigenvector centrality) network topology and the functional role of the striatumin 24 ad patients compared with 20 matched healthy controls (hcs), and their association with dependence characteristics. graph analyses were performed based on pearson 's correlations between rs-fmri time series, while correcting for age, gender and head motion. we found no significant group differences between ad patients and hcs in network topology. notably, within the patient group, but not in hcs, the whole-brain network showed reduced average cluster coefficient with more severe alcohol use, whereas longer ad duration within the patient group was associated with a global decrease in efficiency, degree and clustering coefficient. additionally, within four a-priori chosen bilateral striatal nodes, alcohol use severity was associated with lower clustering coefficient in the left caudate. longer ad duration was associated with reduced clustering coefficient in caudate and putamen, and reduced degree in bilateral caudate, but with increased eigenvector centrality in left posterior putamen. especially changes in global network topology and clustering coefficient in anterior striatum remained strikingly robust after exploratory variations in network weight. our results show adverse effects of ad on overall network integration and possibly on striatal efficiency, putatively contributing to the increasing behavioral impairments seen in chronically addicted patients.
addiction	the studies reported analyze the factorial structure of facebook addiction italian questionnaire (faiq), a variant of 20-item young 's internet addiction test (iat). in study 1, we tested faiq psychometric properties using exploratory factor analysis (efa). in study 2, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) to verify the faiq factorial structure identified through efa. results from cfa confirm the presence of a four-factor model accounting for 58 percent of total variance, plus a general higher order factor that best fits the data. further relationships between faiq factor scores, personality, and facebook usage have been explored.
addiction	purpose: to assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused by the six most commonly occurring candida species in patients with and without malignancies. methods: analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common candida species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (paris area, france, 2002 to 2014). results: of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164 (34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). the hematology patients were significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected by c. tropicalis, c. krusei, or c. kefyr, and more often treated in the first instance with an echinocandin. compared with inpatients who were not in icu at the time of fungemia, those in icu were less frequently infected by c. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). an increase in crude mortality over time in icu was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). for all patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood culture increased the risk of death. the odds of being infected by a given candida species compared with c. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type of malignancy, hospitalization in icu, central venous catheter, hiv status, intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. compared with c. albicans, c. glabrata (or = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and c. parapsilosis (or = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8 and day 30. conclusion: the clinical context of underlying malignancy and hospitalization in icu may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.
addiction	background and objectives: the seeds of sophora alopecuroides l. var. alopecuroides may benefit treatment of opioid dependence. therefore, the plant alkaloid composition, toxicity and effects on morphine withdrawal were studied. methods: the alkaloid composition was determined by gc and gc/ms analysis. mice were made dependent by morphine injected 3 times a day for 3 days. the withdrawal jumping and diarrhea were induced by administration of naloxone 2 h after the 10th injection of morphine on the day 4. the ethanol 90% extract (100, 200, 300 mg/kg), alkaloid fraction (5, 10, 20 mg/kg), morphine (50 mg/kg) or saline were injected 30 min before naloxone. all drugs were injected subcutaneously to groups each consisting of 10 mice. to assess toxicity, different doses of the ethanol or aqueous extracts dissolved in normal saline were gavaged once to groups each consisting of 30 mice. afterward, the numbers of dead animals within 72 h after gavage were counted and ld50 was calculated. results: matrine, cytisine, sophoridine, n-methyl cytisine, sophocarpine and sophoramine were the major alkaloids. all doses of the total extract, alkaloid fraction and morphine decreased jumping and diarrhea significantly compared to the saline (p0.05). the ethanol and aqueous extracts ld50 were 355 mg/kg and 540 mg/kg, respectively. conclusion: the plant inhibited opioid withdrawal with efficacy comparable to morphine. the alkaloids may be involved in the effect. the ethanol and aqueous extracts are moderately and slightly orally toxic, respectively.
atopic_dermatitis	background: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is associated with local immunoglobulin hyperproduction and the presence of ige antibodies against staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (saes). aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a severe form of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in which nearly all patients express anti-saes. objectives: we aimed to understand antibodies reactive to saes and determine whether they recognize saes through their complementarity-determining regions (cdrs) or framework regions. methods: labeled staphylococcal enterotoxin (se) a, sed, and see were used to isolate single sae-specific b cells from the nasal polyps of 3 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. recombinant antibodies with ""matched"" heavy and light chains were cloned as igg(1), and those of high affinity for specific saes, assayed by means of elisa and surface plasmon resonance, were recloned as ige and antigen-binding fragments. ige activities were tested in basophil degranulation assays. results: thirty-seven sae-specific, igg- or iga-expressing b cells were isolated and yielded 6 anti-sae clones, 2 each for sea, sed, and see. competition binding assays revealed that the anti-see antibodies recognize nonoverlapping epitopes in see. unexpectedly, each anti-see mediated see-induced basophil degranulation, and igg(1) or antigen-binding fragments of each anti-see enhanced degranulation by the other anti-see. conclusions: sees can activate basophils by simultaneously binding as antigens in the conventional manner to cdrs and as superantigens to framework regions of anti-see ige in anti-see ige-fc epsilon ri complexes. anti-see igg(1)s can enhance the activity of anti-see iges as conventional antibodies through cdrs or simultaneously as conventional antibodies and as ""superantibodies"" through cdrs and framework regions to sees in see-anti-see ige-fc epsilon ri complexes.
atopic_dermatitis	probiotics are living microorganisms providing health beneficial effect to the host (1). probiotics have been used for the treatment or prevention of various diseases related to diarrhea (2), cholesterol (3) immune function (4), and inflammatory bowel disease (5). in addition, recent study also presents that probiotic bacteria in the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus genera are able to have therapeutic effects in the patients of psychological disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and memory (6). lactobacillus casei is a gram-positive bacterium that naturally inhabits the human and animal gastrointestinal and mouth organs (7). as its name implies, this heterofermentative microorganism is the dominant species present in ripening cheddar cheese (8). in probiotic aspects, l. casei showed beneficial roles in the activation of the gut mucosal immune system (9), treatment of diabetics (10), and chronic constipation (11). in the previous study, we isolated l. casei lc5 strain from fermented dairy products, which showed immune regulatory functions, especially, therapeutic effect on atopic dermatitis as a member of complex probiotics (12-14). in order to gain better insight of the probiotic effect on atopic dermatitis, we analyzed the genome sequence of l. casei lc5. according to the report of ncbi genome, 1 more than two hundreds of lactobacillus organisms are sequenced and their beneficial properties derived from genomic information are used in the food industry. however, the available genomes of l. casei strains as members of health promoting probiotics are still insufficient. furthermore, l. casei strains are frequently confused with the closely related strains such as lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. therefore, comparative study in a whole genome scale is required to clarify taxonomic association of l. casei lc5 as well as its functional characteristics. the availability of the genomic information of l. casei lc5 will aid as a basis for further in-depth analysis of the probiotic function of l. casei strains.
atopic_dermatitis	purpose: the src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor protein b (shb) is widely expressed in immune cells and acts as an important regulator for hematopoietic cell function. shb silencing induces th2 immunity in mice. shb is also involved in t-cell homeostasis in vivo. however, shb has not yet been studied and addressed in association with dendritic cells (dcs). materials and methods: the effects of shb expression on the immunogenicity of dcs were assessed by shb gene silencing in mouse bone marrow-derived dcs (bmdcs). after silencing, surface phenotype, cytokine expression profile, and t-cell stimulation capacity of bmdcs were examined. we investigated the signaling pathways involved in shb expression during bmdc development. we also examined the immunogenicity of shb-knockdown (shbkd) bmdcs in a mouse atopic dermatitis model. results: shb was steadily expressed in mouse splenic dcs and in in vitro-generated bmdcs in both immature and mature stages. shb expression was contingent on activation of the mitogen- activated protein kinase/foxa2 signaling pathway during dc development. shbkd increased the expression of mhc class ii and costimulatory molecules without affecting the cytokine expression of bmdcs. when co-cultured with t cells, shbkd in bmdcs significantly induc-ed cd4+ t-cell proliferation and the expression of th2 cytokines, while the regulatory t cell (treg) population was downregulated. in mouse atopic dermatitis model, mice inoculated with shbkd dcs developed more severe symptoms of atopic dermatitis compared with mice injected with control dcs. conclusion: shb expression in dcs plays an important role in t-cell homeostasis in vivo by regulating dc-mediated th2 polarization.
atopic_dermatitis	practall is a joint initiative of the american academy of allergy, asthma & immunology and the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology to provide shared evidence-based recommendations on cutting-edge topics in the field of allergy and immunology. practall 2017 is focused on what has been established regarding the role of the microbiome in patients with asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy. this is complemented by outlining important knowledge gaps regarding its role in allergic disease and delineating strategies necessary to fill these gaps. in addition, a review of progress in approaches used to manipulate the microbiome will be addressed, identifying what has and has not worked to serve as a baseline for future directions to intervene in allergic disease development, progression, or both.
atopic_dermatitis	background: the march from early aeroallergen sensitization to subsequent respiratory allergy is well established, but it is unclear whether early life food sensitization precedes and further increases risk of allergic airway disease. objective: to assess the association between food sensitization in the first 2 years of life and subsequent asthma and allergic rhinitis by age 10-12 years. methods: we used data from two independent cohorts: the high-risk melbourne atopic cohort study (macs) (n = 620) and the population-based lisaplus (n = 3094). food sensitization was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months in macs and 24 months in lisaplus. multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate associations between sensitization to food only, aeroallergen only, or both and allergic airway disease. results: when compared to non-sensitized children, sensitization to food only at 12 months in macs and 24 months in lisaplus was associated with increased risk of current asthma (aor = 2.2; 95% ci 1.1, 4.6 in macs and aor = 4.9; 2.4, 10.1 in lisaplus). similar results were seen for allergic rhinitis. additionally, cosensitization to food and aeroallergen in both cohorts at any tested point was a stronger predictor of asthma (at 24 months, aor = 8.3; 3.7, 18.8 in macs and aor = 14.4; 5.0, 41.6 in lisaplus) and allergic rhinitis (at 24 months, aor = 3.9; 1.9, 8.1 in macs and aor = 7.6; 3.0, 19.6 in lisaplus). conclusions: in both cohorts, food sensitization (with or without aeroallergen sensitization) in the first two years of life increased the risk of subsequent asthma and allergic rhinitis. these findings support the role of early life food sensitization in the atopic march and suggest trials to prevent early onset have the potential to reduce the development of allergic airways disease.
atopic_dermatitis	context: spirodela polyrhiza (l.) schleid. (lemnaceae), spirodelae herba (sh), has been known to relieve inflammation, urticaria and skin symptoms including pruritus, eczema and rash. objective: the effects of sh extract on two calcium ion channels, orai1 and trpv3, and their potential as novel therapeutics for atopic dermatitis (ad) were investigated. the regulatory role of orai1 on mast cell degranulation was evaluated. materials and methods: the dried leaves of sh were extracted by 70% methanol. effects of sh extract (100 mu g/ml) in an hek293t cell line overexpressing human orai1 or trpv3 were assessed. ion channel modulation in transfected hek293t cells was measured using a conventional whole-cell patch-clamp technique. ige-antigen complex-stimulated mast cell degranulation was measured by beta-hexosaminidase assay with morphological observation after treatment with 20, 50 and 100 mu g/ml sh extract. results: sh extract (100 mu g/ml) significantly inhibited orai1 activity (63.8 +/- 0.97%) in orai1-stim1 co-overexpressed hek293t cells. sh extract significantly increased trpv3 activity (81.29 +/- 0.05% at 100mv) compared with the positive control 2-apb (100 mu m), which induced full activation. sh extract inhibited degranulation in ige-antigen complex-stimulated rbl-2h3 mast cells by decreasing beta-hexosaminidase activity (3.14 +/- 0.03, 2.56 +/- 0.12 and 2.29 +/- 0.08 mu/mg, respectively). conclusion: our results suggested that sh extract could treat abnormal skin barrier pathologies in ad through modulation of the activities of the calcium ion channels orai1 and trpv3 and inhibition of mast cell degranulation. this is the first report of an herbal effect on the modulation of ion channels associated with skin barrier disruption in ad pathogenesis.
atopic_dermatitis	background: antibody responses to the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine in patients with atopic dermatitis (ad) have not been carefully characterized. objective: the primary objective of this study was to compare antibody responses to intradermal vaccination in participants with moderate/severe ad with those in nonatopic participants. secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of route of administration, staphylococcus aureus skin colonization, and disease severity on vaccine response. methods: this was an open-label study conducted in the 2012-2013 influenza season at 5 us clinical sites. a total of 360 participants with moderate/severe ad or nonatopic subjects were assessed for eligibility, 347 of whom received intradermal or intramuscular vaccination per label and were followed for 28 days after vaccination. the primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of participants achieving seroprotection (hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer >= 1:40 on day 28 after vaccination). results: seroprotection rates for influenza b, h1n1, and h3n2 were not different (1) between participants with ad and nonatopic participants receiving intradermal vaccination and (2) between ad participants receiving intradermal and intramuscular vaccination. after intradermal, but not intramuscular, vaccination, participants with ad with s aureus colonization experienced (1) lower seroprotection and seroconversion rates and lower hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer geometric mean fold increase against influenza b and (2) lower seroconversion rates against influenza h1n1 than noncolonized participants with ad. conclusion: participants with ad colonized with s aureus exhibited a reduced immune response to influenza vaccination compared with noncolonized participants after intradermal but not intramuscular vaccination. because most patients with ad are colonized with s aureus, intramuscular influenza vaccination should be given preference in these patients.
atopic_dermatitis	background: allergic diseases are thought to be inherited. prevalence of allergic diseases has, however, increased dramatically in last decades, suggesting environmental causes for the development of allergic diseases. objective: we studied risk factors associated with the development of atopic dermatitis (ad), allergic rhinitis (ar) and asthma (as) in children of non-atopic parents in a subtropical country. methods: in a birth cohort of 1,497 newborns, parents were prenatally enrolled and validated for allergic diseases by questionnaire, physician-verified and total or specific immunoglobulin e (ige) levels; 1,236 and 756 children, respectively, completed their 3-year and 6-year follow-up. clinical examination, questionnaire, and blood samples for total and specific ige of the children were collected at each follow-up visit. results: prevalence of ad, ar and as was, respectively, 8.2%, 30.8% and 12.4% in children of non-atopic parents. prevalence of ar (p<. 001) and as (p=. 018) was significantly higher in children of parents who were both atopic. a combination of cesarean section (c/s) and breastfeeding for more than 1 month showed the highest risk for ad (or= 3.111, p=. 006). infants living in homes with curtains and no air filters had the highest risk for ar (or= 2.647, p<. 001), and male infants of non-atopic parents living in homes without air filters had the highest risk for as (or= 1.930, p=. 039). conclusions: breastfeeding and c/s affect development of ad. gender, use of curtains and/or air filters affect ar and as, suggesting that control of the perinatal environment is necessary for the prevention of atopic diseases in children of nonatopic parents.
atopic_dermatitis	non-adherence to treatment and medical recommendations is one of the leading causes of treatment failure, poor clinical outcomes, and increased healthcare utilization. although non-adherence is observed across all medical specialties, adherence to treatment in dermatology deserves special attention given the multiple different routes of treatment. adherence can be measured using subjective methods (patient reporting and questionnaires) or objective methods (pill counts, electronic chips, and pharmacy records). adherence to dermatologic treatments varies based on the specific condition but is poor for systemic therapies and even worse with topical agents. among the factors that influence adherence, duration of treatment, complexity of regimen, and access play a large role. interventions to improve adherence can range from simplifying treatment regimens to scheduling more frequent office visits. due to the profound effect on cost, healthcare outcomes, and mortality, understanding and improving adherence is equally as important as making the correct diagnosis and prescribing the correct treatment.
atopic_dermatitis	immunoglobulin (ig) e-mediated food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis (eoe) are chronic, allergen-mediated disorders characterized by an aberrant th2 immune response. the development and investigation of biologics for the treatment of ige-mediated food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis have provided further insight into the pathophysiology and management of these disorders. this article provides an overview of biologic therapies that are being investigated or have potential as treatments for ige-mediated food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis. identification of eoe phenotypes that are responsive to biologics and investigation of biologics combined with other therapies may help elucidate a role for biologics in eoe.
digestive_health	in rabbits, the bacterial and archaeal community of caecal ecosystem is composed mostly of species not yet described and very specific to that species. in mammals, the digestive ecosystem plays important physiological roles: hydrolysis and fermentation of nutrients, immune system regulation, angiogenesis, gut development and acting as a barrier against pathogens. understanding the functioning of the digestive ecosystem and how to control its functional and specific diversity is a priority as this could provide new strategies to improve the resistance of the young rabbit to digestive disorders and improve feed efficiency. this review first recalls some facts about the specificity of rabbit digestive microbiota composition in the main fermentation compartment, and its variability with some new insights based on recent molecular approaches. the main functions of the digestive microbiota will then be explained. finally some possible ways to control rabbit caecal microbiota will be proposed and a suitable timing for action will be defined.
digestive_health	background: understanding views about what constitutes a healthy diet in diverse populations may inform design of culturally tailored behavior change interventions. the objective of this study was to describe perspectives on healthy eating among chinese and american young adults and identify similarities and differences between these groups. methods: chinese (n = 55) and american (n = 57) undergraduate students in changsha, hunan, china and honolulu, hawai'i, u.s.a. composed one- to two-paragraph responses to the following prompt: ""what does the phrase `a healthy diet' mean to you?"" researchers used content analysis to identify predominant themes using dedoose (version 5.2.0, sociocultural research consultants, llc, los angeles, ca, 2015). three researchers independently coded essays and grouped codes with similar content. the team then identified themes and sorted them in discussion. two researchers then deductively coded the entire data set using eight codes developed from the initial coding and calculated total code counts for each group of participants. results: chinese students mentioned physical outcomes, such as maintaining immunity and digestive health. timing of eating, with regular meals and greater intake during day than night, was emphasized. american students described balancing among food groups and balancing consumption with exercise, with physical activity considered essential. students also stated that food components such as sugar, salt and fat should be avoided in large quantities. similarities included principles such as moderation and fruits and vegetables as nutritious, and differences included foods to be restricted and meal timing. while both groups emphasized specific foods and guiding dietary principles, several distinctions in viewpoints emerged. conclusions: the diverse views may reflect food-related messages to which participants are exposed both through the media and educational systems in their respective countries. future studies may further examine themes that may not typically be addressed in nutrition education programs in diverse populations of young adults. gaining greater knowledge of the ways in which healthy eating is viewed will allow for development of interventions that are sensitive to the traditional values and predominant views of health in various groups.
digestive_health	the canadian association of gastroenterology and the canadian digestive health foundation published guidelines on colon cancer screening in 2004. subsequent to the publication of these guidelines, many advances have occurred, thereby necessitating a review of the existing guidelines in the context of new technologies and clinical knowledge. the assembled guideline panel recognized three recent american sets of guidelines and identified seven issues that required comment from a canadian perspective. these issues included, among others, the role of program-based screening, flexible sigmoidoscopy, computed tomography colonography, barium enema and quality improvement. the panel also provided context for the selection of the fecal immunochemical test as the fecal occult blood test of choice, and the relative role of colonoscopy as a primary screening tool. recommendations were also provided for an upper age limit for colon cancer screening, whether upper endoscopy should be performed following a negative colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test and when colon cancer screening should resume following negative colonoscopy.
digestive_health	this work aimed to study the response of the growing rabbit caecal ecosystem (bacterial community and caecal environmental parameters) after a switch from a control to a low-fibre diet (lfd). a group of 160 rabbits were fed ad libitum a control diet (adf: 20.4%) from weaning (36 days). at 49 days of age (day 0), 75 rabbits were switched to a lfd group (adf: 10.7%), whereas 85 others (control group) remained on the control diet, for 39 days. caecal contents were regularly sampled throughout the trial (60 rabbits per group). the bacterial community structure was characterized using ce-sscp (capillary electrophoresis single strand conformation polymorphism) and total bacteria were quantified using real-time pcr. redox potential (eh), ph, nh3-n, volatile fatty acid (vfa) were measured in the caecum to characterize environmental parameters. the reduction of fibre in the diet modified the ce-sscp profiles (p < 0.001) but not the diversity index (5.6 +/- 0.8, ns). the number of 16s rrna gene copies of total bacteria decreased (p < 0.01) in lfd rabbits compared with controls. in lfd rabbits, the caecal environment was less acid (+0.2 units; p < 0.01), more reductive (-11 mv; p < 0.05) and drier (+3.4 g 100 per g; p < 0.001), with an increase in nh3-n (+77%; p < 0.001) and a decrease in total vfa concentration (-17%; p < 0.001). we found significant correlations between the bacterial community, the quantity of bacteria and the caecal traits of the caecal ecosystem. indeed, in both groups, the caecal traits barely constrained the total inertia of the ce-sscp profile set (less than 14%), whereas total bacteria were positively related to total vfa, acetic acid and butyric acid levels, and eh, and negatively related to ph. all the microbial and environmental modifications had occurred by day 2 and remained stable thereafter. these results suggest that the bacterial community in the growing rabbit caecum is able to adapt quickly after a change to in the dietary fibre supply to reach a new steady-state equilibrium.
digestive_health	measurement: of the impact and influence of medical/scientific journals, and of individual researchers has become more widely practiced in recent decades. tills is driven, in part, by the increased availability of data regarding citations of research articles, and by increased competition for research funding. digestive disease research has been identified as a particularly strong discipline in canada. the authors collected quantitative data on the impact and influence of canadian digestive health research. the present study involved an analysis of the research impact (hirsch factor) and research influence (influence factor) of 106 digestive health researchers in canada. rankings of the top 25 researchers on the basis of the two metrics were dominated by the larger research groups at the university of toronto (toronto, ontario), mcmaster university (hamilton, ontario), and the universities of calgary (calgary, alberta) and alberta (edmonton, alberta), but with representation by other research groups at the universities of manitoba (winnipeg, manitoba), western ontario (london, ontario) and mcgill university (montreal, quebec). female and male researchers had similar scores for the two metrics, as did basic scientists versus clinical investigators. strategic recruitment, particularly of established investigators, can have a major impact on the ranking of research groups. comparing these metrics over different time frames can provide insights into the vulnerabilities and strengths of research groups.
digestive_health	this study aimed at comparing various diets predicted to induce different stimulations of the cecal microbial activity of the young rabbit fed ad libitum from 16 to 70 d of age: i) a diet enriched with rapidly fermentable fiber expected to stimulate the cecal microbial activity (rff group); ii) a control diet with a standard composition (c group); iii) and the same control diet with tiamulin and apramycin antibiotics, expected to inhibit the microbial activity (c+ab group). a total of 398 rabbits were used from 42 litters and weaned at 28 d of age. an in vivo digestibility trial was performed on 36 rabbits of 42 to 46 d of age housed in individual metabolic cages. the feed intake and growth rates were lower in the rff group compared with the c+ab group (-15% in adfi and -11% in adg, p < 0.001), with a lower weight of -183 g at 70 d (p < 0.001). no significant difference was found on adg and final bw between the rff and the c groups, but the rff diet allowed a better g: f ratio at postweaning (p < 0.01). the digestion of soluble fiber (total dietary fiber minus ndf) was greater for the rff group. the c+ab diet had a positive effect on the postweaning morbidity rate (p < 0.05) but did not affect the mortality rate and the health risk index (morbidity and mortality). conversely, the rff diet appeared to reduce the mortality rate compared with the c+ab diet, especially before 41 d of age. concerning the cecal microbial activity, a supply of rff in the diet increased the cecal vfa concentrations (+28% vs. c+ab and +22% vs. c, p < 0.001) and lowered the ph. the vfa pattern was affected at 45 and 60 d, with a dominance of acetate in the rff group (+4% vs. c+ab and c groups, p < 0.001) instead of butyrate in the c+ab and c groups (-3.6% and -5% vs. c+ab and c, respectively, p < 0.001). antibiotics addition (c+ab group) reduced the vfa concentration, but only after weaning (-25% at 45d of age) without changing the fermentation pattern. in conclusion, early intake of rff in young rabbits stimulated the cecal microbial activity, and reduced the voluntary feed intake, leading to a reduced g: f ratio.
digestive_health	our colons harbor trillions of microbes including a prominent archaeon, methanobrevibacter smithii. to examine the contributions of archaea to digestive health, we colonized germ-free mice with bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an adaptive bacterial forager of the polysaccharides that we consume, with or without m. smithii or the sulfate-reducing bacterium desulfovibrio piger. whole-genome transcriptional profiling of b. thetaiotaomicron, combined with mass spectrometry, revealed that, unlike d. piger, m. smithii directs b. thetaiotaomicron to focus on fermentation of dietary fructans to acetate, whereas b. thetaiotaomicron-derived formate is used by m. smithii for methanogenesis. b. thetaiotaomicron-m. smithii cocolonization produces a significant increase in host adiposity compared with monoassociated, or b. thetaiotaomicron-d. piger biassociated, animals. these findings demonstrate a link between this archaeon, prioritized bacterial utilization of polysaccharides commonly encountered in our modern diets, and host energy balance.
digestive_health	normal digestive tract microbiota plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis and normal development of the digestive tract and metabolism, immunity and angiogenesis. treatment with antibiotics, especially in children, is often associated with significant changes in intestinal microbiota, which can lead to intestinal disbioses. probiotic bacteria have been used for over a century to promote digestive health. the objective of this study was to investigate the interrelations between probiotic bifidobacterium strains isolated from infants faeces by studying their influence on the expression of antibiotic resistance of enteropathogenic strains recently isolated from digestive tract infections. this study demonstrates that probiotics associated with antibiotics increase enteropapathogens susceptibility to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, quinolones and carbapenems.
digestive_health	post-weaning feed restriction is a common practice in rabbit farming to reduce mortality, but results in lower growth performance and slaughter weights. this study aimed to assess the influence of 2 diets both rich in fibre and low in starch, with high or low digestible energy (de) and digestible protein (dp) contents for a constant dp/de ratio offered from 18 to 70 d of age, on the growth performance and health parameters of rabbits. eight hundred rabbit kits were divided in 2 experimental groups differing in the feed offered from 18 to 70 d: a high concentrate diet (hc group; 10.37 mj de/kg dm and 102 g dp/kg dm) or low concentrate diet (lc group; 9.63 mj de/kg dm and 95 g dp/kg dm). feed was offered ad libitum before weaning (35 d) and from 63 to 70 d, while feed offered from 35 to 63 d was controlled to obtain similar de intake in both groups. feed intake, animal weights and health status were recorded weekly. mortality was recorded daily. feed intake was similar in both groups before weaning (p=0.204), and consequently the de intake was higher in the hc group compared to the lc group before weaning (3.91 vs. 3.39 mj, respectively; p=0.017). feed intake from 63 to 70 d was lower in the ho than in the lc group (229 vs. 239 g/d/kit, respectively; p<0.001). total de ingested after weaning was similar in both groups (45.44 mj; p=0.143). kits were heavier in the ho group throughout the study (p<0.05). a higher average daily gain during the periods of 18-28, 35-42 and 56-63 d was seen in the ho group (+8.1%, +16.8% and +4.5%, respectively; p<0.05). mortality and morbidity rates were similar between groups throughout the study (p=1.0 and p=0.104, respectively). our results suggest that when the feed intake after weaning is controlled, i) the feeding strategy before weaning determines the weight at weaning and at slaughter age; and ii) rabbits fed a diet more highly concentrated but rich in fibre increase their growth performance without negative consequences on their digestive health.
digestive_health	background: quality of life (qol) improvement is the main objective of treating patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). this study aimed to assess the validity, reliability, and factor analysis of ibs-qol-34 questionnaire as a common transcultural instrument for iranian ibs patients. materials and methods: two hundred and forty patients with ibs (based on gastroenterologists' diagnosis according to rom iii criteria) were referred to digestive health clinic in psychosomatic research center have been selected in this study. aside with ibs-qol-34, mos 36-item short-form health survey (sf-36) and ibs severity index (ibssi) questionnaires were completed by the cases for determination of correlation coefficients; the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, cronbach 's alpha, pearson correlation coefficient by statistical package for social sciences (spss) software, version 18. results: total reliability of the questionnaire was reported by using cronbach 's alpha as 0.95, ranging from 0.65 to 0.90. correlation coefficients of concurrent implementation of ibs-qol with sf-36 and ibssi resulted in - 0.61 and 0.64, respectively. exploratory factor analysis using varimax rotation identified eight principle components, which will determine qol at 67% variance. conclusion: according to the results, ibs-qol-34 questionnaire has good psychometric properties in the research community and can be safely used as a valid tool to assess qol of patients with ibs for healthcare and therapeutic purposes.
healthy_sleep	standard replacement therapy for addison 's disease (ad) does not restore a normal circadian rhythm. in fact, hydrocortisone replacement in ad patients likely induces disrupted sleep. given that healthy sleep plays an important role in improving quality of life, optimizing cognition, and ensuring affect regulation, the aim of this study was to investigate whether poor quality of life, mood alterations, and memory complaints reported by ad patients are associated with their disrupted sleep patterns. sixty patients with ad and 60 matched healthy controls completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing perceived physical and mental health (short-form 36), mood (beck depression inventory-ii), sleep quality (pittsburgh sleep quality index), and cognition (cognitive failures questionnaire). a latent variable model revealed that although ad had a significant direct effect on quality of life, the indirect effect of sleep was significantly greater. furthermore, although ad had no direct effect on cognitive functioning, the indirect effect of sleep was significant. the overall model showed a good fit (comparative fit index = 0.91, root mean square of approximation = 0.09, and standardized root mean square residual = 0.05). our findings suggest that disrupted sleep, and not the disease per se, may induce poor quality of life, memory impairment, and affect dysregulation in patients with ad. we think that improving sleep architecture may improve cognitive, affective, and physical functioning.

healthy_sleep	people spend a third of the lifetime on sleep. exercise and light exposing have critical influence on sleep quality. exercise affects sleep efficiency, and the light exposing affect sleep circadian rhythm. this paper investigates the impact of sleep rhythm and efficiency with a html5-based behavior recording and analytic service - healthy sleep space (hss). hss takes advantages of important features from html5, such as consistent user experience across multiple mobile device; offline processing etc. with hss, users can record their sleep and behavioral information; then analyze collected information in the cloud, regardless of internet condition or type of mobile devices. we propose a simple sleep quotient (sq) index to evaluate the quality of sleep. based on the sq values, hss provides appropriate exercise and light exposing prescriptions to users eventually modify daytime behavior, and to improve sleep quality.
healthy_sleep	transitioning to university involves a major life change that can have implications for physical and mental health. this study had three objectives: first, assess the mental health and health-behavior participation of australian university students; second, evaluate clustering of health behaviors; and third, examine how mental health relates to health behaviors. university students (n=751) enrolled at an australian regional university completed an online survey containing the depression, anxiety, and stress scales and a health-behavior questionnaire. over one-third of students reported mild or higher mental illness symptoms and most reported engaging in multiple unhealthy behaviors. furthermore, mental health was associated with unhealthy behaviors. for males, depressive symptoms were associated with skipping breakfast and poor sleep quality. for females, depressive symptoms were associated with skipping breakfast, inadequate vigorous physical activity, and short or long sleep hours. stress symptoms in females were associated with healthy sleep hours, but poor sleep quality. future research may consider whether an intervention targeting one or two key health behaviors has utility in improving participation in other health behaviors and mental health.
healthy_sleep	the abcs of sleeping mnemonic was developed to serve as an organizing framework for common pediatric sleep recommendations. the mnemonic stands for 1) age appropriate bedtimes and wake times with consistency, 2) schedules and routines, 3) location, 4) exercise and diet, 5) no electronics in the bedroom or before bed, 6) positivity 7) independence when falling asleep and 8) needs of child met during the day, 9) equal great sleep. this review examines the empirical evidence behind the practices and recommendations captured by the abcs of sleeping mnemonic for children aged 1 to 12. a search was conducted of key electronic databases (pubmed, psycinfo, cinahl, & embase) to identify english articles that included the concepts of sleep, insomnia, and/or bedtime. 77 articles were eligible for inclusion and were coded to extract key details and findings regarding the relations between sleep practices identified in the abcs of sleeping mnemonic and sleep outcomes. findings provided preliminary support for many of the recommendations that are commonly made to families regarding healthy sleep practices. however, more robust investigations are needed to better understand the causal contributions of healthy sleep practices to the onset and maintenance of children 's sleep problems.

healthy_sleep	study objective: to examine the relationship between sleep and dietary intake in adolescents using an experimental sleep restriction protocol. design: randomized crossover sleep restriction-extension paradigm. setting: sleep obtained and monitored at home, diet measured during an office visit. participants: forty-one typically developing adolescents age 14-16 years. interventions: the 3-week protocol consisting of a baseline week designed to stabilize the circadian rhythm, followed randomly by 5 consecutive nights of sleep restriction (6.5 hours in bed monday-friday) versus healthy sleep duration (10 hours in bed), a 2-night washout period, and a 5-night crossover period. measurements: sleep was monitored via actigraphy and teens completed validated 24-hour diet recall interviews following each experimental condition. results: paired-sample t-tests examined differences between conditions for consumption of key macronutrients and choices from dietary categories. compared with the healthy sleep condition, sleep-restricted adolescents' diets were characterized by higher glycemic index and glycemic load and a trend toward more calories and carbohydrates, with no differences in fat or protein consumption. exploratory analyses revealed the consumption of significantly more desserts and sweets during sleep restriction than healthy sleep. conclusions: chronic sleep restriction during adolescence appears to cause increased consumption of foods with a high glycemic index, particularly desserts/sweets. the chronic sleep restriction common in adolescence may cause changes in dietary behaviors that increase risk of obesity and associated morbidity.
healthy_sleep	aims: to investigate the hypothesis that the presence of transient morning masticatory muscle pain in young, healthy sleep bruxers (sbr) is associated with sex-related differences in sleep electroencephalographic (eeg) activity. methods: data on morning masticatory muscle pain and sleep variables were obtained from visual analog scales and a second night of polysomnographic recordings. nineteen normal control (ctrl) subjects were age-and sex-matched to 62 tooth-grinding sbr. differences in sleep macrostructure (stage distribution and duration, number of sleep-stage shifts), number of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (rmma) events/hour, and eeg activity were analyzed blind to subject status. the influence of pain and gender in sbr and ctrl subjects was assessed with the fisher 's exact test, mann-whitney u test, two-sample t test, and analysis of variance (anova). results: low-intensity morning transient orofacial pain was reported by 71% of sbr, with no sex difference. rmma event frequency was higher in sb than ctrl subjects (4.5/hour vs 1.3/hour; p < .001). sbr had fewer sleep-stage shifts, irrespective of sex or pain status. female sbr had significantly lower theta and alpha eeg activity compared to female ctrl subjects (p = .03), irrespective of pain. conclusion: female sbr had lower theta and alpha eeg activity irrespective of transient morning pain.
healthy_sleep	although a subset of iraq and afghanistan veterans show aggression toward others after they return home from military service, little is known about protective mechanisms that could be bolstered to prevent violence. a national longitudinal survey was conducted between 2009 and 2011 using a random sample of veterans who served in operation iraqi freedom or operation enduring freedom. one thousand and ninety veterans, from 50 states representing all military branches, completed 2 waves of data collection, 1 year apart (retention rate = 79%). the final sample resembled the u.s. military post 9/11 in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, geography, and service branch. protective mechanisms in socioeconomic (money to cover basic needs, stable employment), psychosocial (resilience, perceiving control over one 's life, social support), and physical (healthy sleep, no physical pain) domains were examined. we found these protective mechanisms predicted decreased aggression and violence at follow-up, particularly among higher risk veterans. multivariable analyses confirmed that protective mechanisms lowered violence through their interaction with risk factors. this study identifies protective mechanisms related to decreased community violence in veterans and indicates that rehabilitation aimed at improving socioeconomic, psychosocial, and physical well-being has potential promise to reduce aggression and violence among veterans after returning home from military service.
healthy_sleep	objective: to provide evidence- or consensus-based recommendations concerning the assessment and management of sleep problems in youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). method: pubmed, ovid, embase, and web of knowledge were searched through october 31, 2012. when no evidence was available, consensus of the authors was achieved. the evidence-level of the recommendations on the management of sleep disturbances was based on the scottish intercollegiate guidelines network (sign) system. results: a total of 139 original articles on sleep and childhood adhd were retrieved, including 22 on treatment of sleep disturbances. this review focuses on behaviorally based insomnia, circadian rhythm disorder, sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder, and sleep disturbances due to comorbid psychiatric disorders or adhd medications. healthy sleep practices are recommended as the foundation of management strategies. behavioral interventions should be considered as first-line treatment of insomnia, although further evidence from randomized controlled trials (rcts) is needed to prove their efficacy in adhd. among pharmacological treatments, rcts support the use of melatonin to reduce sleep-onset delay, whereas there is more limited evidence for other medications. conclusion: growing empirical evidence is informing assessment/management strategies of sleep problems in youths with adhd. however, further rcts are warranted to support current recommendations.
healthy_sleep	objectives: the purpose of this study was to assess state licensing and administrative regulations promoting healthy sleep practices in child care and to compare these regulations to national recommendations. methods: we reviewed regulations related to healthy sleep practices for all states and territories for both child care centers (centers) and family child care homes (homes). we compared regulations with institute of medicine recommendations to promote sleep in child care, including (1) create environments that ensure restful sleep; (2) encourage sleep-promoting behaviors and practices; (3) encourage practices that promote child self-regulation of sleep; and (4) seek consultation yearly from a sleep expert. we used cochran-mantel-haenszel trend tests to assess associations between geographic region and number of regulations consistent with the recommendations. results: the mean number of regulations for states was 0.9 for centers and 0.8 for homes out of a possible 4.0. for centers, no state had regulations for all 4 recommendations; 11 states had regulations for 2 of the 4 recommendations. for homes, 9 states had regulations for 2 of the recommendations. states in the northeast had the greatest mean number of regulations for centers (1.2) and homes (1.1), and states in the south had the fewest (0.7 and 0.7, respectively); these geographic differences were significant for centers (p = .03) but not homes (p = .14). conclusions: more states in the northeast had regulations consistent with the institute of medicine sleep recommendations, but overall few states had regulations consistent with the recommendations.
healthy_sleep	background. regular sleep schedules are an important part of healthy sleep habits. although television viewing is associated with altered sleep patterns and sleep disorders among children and adolescents, the effect of television viewing on the sleep patterns of infants and toddlers is not known. objective. to test the hypothesis that television viewing by infants and toddlers is associated with having irregular naptime and bedtime schedules. methods. we used data from the national survey of early childhood health, a nationally representative, cross-sectional study of the health and health care of children 4 to 35 months of age. our main outcome measures were whether children had irregular naptime and bedtime schedules. our main predictor was hours of television watched on a daily basis. we performed multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusting for a variety of factors including demographic information, measures of maternal mental health, and measures of family interactions, to test the independent association of television viewing and irregular naptime and bedtime schedules. results. data were available for 2068 children. thirty-four percent of all children had irregular naptime schedules, and 27% had irregular bedtime schedules. mean hours of television viewing per day were as follows: 0.9 hours/ day ( 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.8-1.0 hours/ day) for children < 12 months of age, 1.6 hours/ day ( 95% ci: 1.4-1.8 hours/ day) for children 12 to 23 months of age, and 2.3 hours/day ( 95% ci: 2.1-2.5 hours/ day) for children 24 to 35 months of age. in our logistic regression model, the number of hours of television watched per day was associated with both an irregular naptime schedule ( odds ratio: 1.09; 95% ci: 1.01 -1.18) and an irregular bedtime schedule ( odds ratio: 1.13; 95% ci: 1.04-1.24). conclusions. television viewing among infants and toddlers is associated with irregular sleep schedules. more research is warranted to determine whether this association is causal.
anxiety	in the present study, we examined group differences in error-related negativity (ern) based on perfectionism and emotional intelligence (eiq). ern is an erp component that is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex and peaks 60-150 ms after making an error response on a task. the amplitude of the ern after making a mistake reflects individual differences in emotional traits and performance concerns. past researchers have found that participants higher in perfectionistic doubts displayed larger ern amplitudes; however, researchers have not yet differentiated between type of perfectionism (i.e., adaptive or maladaptive) in relation to ern. additionally, previous researchers have found affective processes are reflected in ern, but have not yet examined whether differences in ern could be influenced by eiq. participants in the present study were 34 adults who responded to surveys and completed a computerized ern paradigm utilizing a flanker task while neural activity was recorded using eeg. the paradigm was designed to elicit a high error rate, thereby allowing capture and measurement of the ern component. anova results indicated maladaptive perfectionists had the greatest negativity, followed by adaptive perfectionists, followed by nonperfectionists. anova results indicated individuals with high eiq had lower ern than individuals with low eiq.

anxiety	background: prenatal detection of congenital malformations gives an opportunity to positively influence prenatal and postnatal management, survival and morbidity, as well as to allow parental choice and psychological preparation. objective: to examine the available evidence regarding the impact of detection and underdetection of fetal anomalies as well as that of fetal therapy on neonatal outcome, parental psychological wellness and neonatal care organization. methods: literature search of pubmed. results and conclusions: the impact of prenatal diagnosis on neonatal survival and morbidity is dependent upon the type and severity of the anomalies inasmuch as upon the evaluation criteria chosen. we discuss the various pitfalls in the design of trials explaining why only few studies, targeting selected anomalies, have shown improved outcomes associated with prenatal diagnosis of congenital malformations. fetal therapy applies mainly to conditions that are lethal either in utero or at birth if untreated before birth. it has rarely been evaluated with the highest level of evidence; this may be explained by a poor acceptability of randomization between prenatal intervention and expectancy up until delivery.
anxiety	telecare is a healthcare resource based on new technologies that, through the services offered, attempt to help elderly people to continue living in their homes. in this sense, first-generation telecare services have quickly developed in europe. the aim of this work was to define the profile, pattern of medication consumption and disease frequencies of elderly users of a telecare service. the cross-sectional study involved 742 spanish community-dwelling elders (85.3% of the total users aged 65 years and over who used a telecare service before the end of the data collection period). data were collected between march and september 2012. subjects' mean age was 83.3 (sd 6.6) years, and the majority lived alone (78.3%) and were female (85.8%). the mean charlson comorbidity index score was 1.13 (sd 1.1), and the mean number of prescribed medications per day was 5.6 (sd 3.0). the most frequent diseases were hypertension (51.1%) and rheumatic disorders (44%); and the most consumed medications were those for the cardiovascular (75%) and nervous (65.2%) systems. for the total sample, the three main determinants of polymedication (five or more medications) were hypertension, anxiety-depressive symptoms and coronary heart disease. regardless of the social elements contributing to the implementation of telecare services, specific health characteristics of potential users, such as morbidity and polypharmacy, should be carefully considered when implementing telecare services in the coming years.
anxiety	we investigated whether juvenile rats do not express renewal following extinction of conditioned fear due to their inability to form a long-term contextual fear memory. in experiment 1, postnatal day (p) 18 and 25 rats received 3 white-noise and footshock pairings, followed by 60 white-noise alone presentations the next day. when tested in a different context to extinction, p25 rats displayed renewal whereas p18 rats did not. experiments 2a and 2b surprisingly showed that p18 and p25 rats do not show differences in contextual and cued fear, regardless of the conditioning-test intervals and the number of white-noise-footshock pairings received. finally, we observed age differences in contextual fear when p25 rats were weaned at p21 in experiment 3. these results indicate that the developmental dissociation observed in renewal of extinguished fear is not related to the widely believed late emergence of contextual fear learning.
anxiety	background: we aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of the leadership and coaching for health (leach) program on physical activity (pa), dietary habits, and distress management in cancer survivors. methods: we randomly assigned 248 cancer survivors with an allocation ratio of two-to-one to the leach program (lp) group, coached by long-term survivors, or the usual care (uc) group. at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, we used pa scores, the intake of vegetables and fruits (vf), and the post traumatic growth inventory (ptgi) as primary outcomes and, for secondary outcomes, the ten rules for highly effective health behavior adhered to and quality of life (qol), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), and the european organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire (eortc qlq-c30). results: for primary outcomes, the two groups did not significantly differ in pa scores or vf intake but differed marginally in ptgi. for secondary outcomes, the lp group showed a significantly greater improvement in the hads anxiety score, the social functioning score, and the appetite loss and financial difficulties scores of the eortc qlq-c30 scales from baseline to 3 months. from baseline to 12 months, the lp group showed a significantly greater decrease in the eortc qlq-c30 fatigue score and a significantly greater increase in the number of the ten rules for highly effective health behavior. conclusion: our findings indicate that the leach program, coached by long-term survivors, can provide effective management of the qol of cancer survivors but not of their pa or dietary habits.
anxiety	background: across cancers, the decision to pursue genetic testing is influenced more by subjective than objective factors. however, skin cancer, which is more prevalent, visual, and multifactorial than many other malignancies, may offer different motivations for pursuing such testing. objectives: the primary objective was to determine factors influencing the decision to receive genetic testing for skin cancer risk. a secondary objective was to assess the impact of priming with health questions on the decision to receive testing. methods: we distributed anonymous online surveys through researchmatch.org to assess participant health, demographics, motivations, and interest in pursuing genetic testing for skin cancer risk. two surveys with identical questions but different question ordering were used to assess the secondary objective. results: we received 3783 responses (64% response rate), and 85.8% desired testing. subjective factors, including curiosity, perceptions of skin cancer, and anxiety, were the most statistically significant determinants of the decision to pursue testing (p < . 001), followed by history of sun exposure (odds ratio 1.85, p < . 01) and history of skin cancer (odds ratio 0.5, p = .01). age and family history of skin cancer did not influence this decision. participants increasingly chose testing if first queried about health behaviors (p < .0001). limitations: the decision to pursue hypothetical testing may differ from in-clinic decision-making. self-selected, online participants may differ from the general population. surveys may be subject to response bias. conclusion: the decision to pursue genetic testing for skin cancer is primarily determined by subjective factors, such as anxiety and curiosity. health factors, including skin cancer history, also influenced decision-making. priming with consideration of objective health factors can increase the desire to pursue testing.
anxiety	individual differences in attentional control involve the ability to voluntarily direct, shift, and sustain attention. in studies of the role of attentional control in emotional adjustment, social relationships, and vulnerability to the effects of stress, self-report questionnaires are commonly used to measure this construct. yet, convincing evidence of the association between self-report scales and actual cognitive performance has not been demonstrated. across 2 independent samples, we examined associations between self-reported attentional control (attentional control scale; acs), self-reported emotional adjustment, five-factor model personality traits (neo personality inventory-revised) and performance measures of attentional control. study 1 examined behavioral performance on the attention network test (ant; fan, mccandliss, sommer, raz, & posner, 2002) and the modified switching task (mst; suchy & kosson, 2006) in a large sample (n = 315) of healthy young adults. study 2 (n = 78) examined behavioral performance on standardized neuropsychological tests of attention, including conner 's continuous performance test-ii and subtests from the wechsler adult intelligence scales, third edition (wais-iii; psychological corporation, 1997) and delis-kaplan executive function system (d-kefs; delis, kaplan, & kramer, 2001). results indicated that the acs was largely unrelated to behavioral performance measures of attentional control but was significantly associated with emotional adjustment, neuroticism, and conscientiousness. these findings suggest that although self-reported attentional control may be a useful construct, researchers using the acs should exercise caution in interpreting it as a proxy for actual cognitive ability or performance.
anxiety	the perceived ability to cope with trauma (pact) scale measures perceived forward-focused and trauma-focused coping. this measure may also have significant utility measuring positive adaption to life-threatening trauma, such as combat. our objective was to examine perceived ability to cope with trauma, as measured by the pact, and the relationships between this perceived ability and clinically pertinent information (anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [ptsd]) among u.s. military veterans. data were provided from 71 combat veterans, consisting of 47 veterans with ptsd and 24 veterans without ptsd who had subthreshold symptoms of the disorder. all veterans completed standardized clinical interviews as well as a battery of well-validated self-report symptom measures. we found that veterans with ptsd had significantly lower pact scores than veterans without ptsd; those without ptsd self-reported more ability to engage in forward-focused and trauma-focused coping than those with ptsd. importantly, we also showed relationships between the pact scores and indices of psychological difficulties as both forward focus and trauma focus coping scores negatively correlated with ptsd, depression, anxiety, and alexithymia. finally, the forward focus pact scale improved prediction of ptsd severity over combat exposure alone. the pact, especially the forward focus scale, appears to be a useful measure of perceived positive coping ability with trauma in combat-exposed veterans who report symptoms of traumatic stress, extending the utility of the measure from normative to clinical populations. the importance of adopting forward-focused coping is discussed.
anxiety	the purpose of this review was to discuss the place of hypnotherapy in a modern medical world dominated by so-called evidence-based clinical practice. hypnosis is an easily learned technique that is a valuable adjuvant to many medical, dental and psychological interventions.
anxiety	we examined the relationship between contact of police officers with citizens, their (meta-)stereotypes about citizens, and their work-related well-being. ninety-three police officers from 4 police stations in low- and high-crime regions in france completed the questionnaire. as expected, negative well-being of police officers is predicted by negative contact with citizens and their belief that police officers are stereotyped negatively by citizens. moreover, the relationship between negative contact and negative well-being was mediated by police officers' beliefs that police officers are perceived negatively by citizens, whereas their perceptions of citizens did not mediate this relationship. interestingly, level of crime did not influence these relationships. together, this research shows the important role of beliefs about how one 's group is stereotyped when in contact with another group as it may have consequences for people 's well-being.
psoriasis	in psoriatic skin, laminin integrity is altered, which could lead to insufficient laminin integrin interactions, leaving the 6-integrin exposed and possibly accessible for autoantibody production. therefore we investigated the presence of anti-6-integrin autoantibodies in the serum of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (ps), psoriatic arthritis (psa) and rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in comparison with healthy donors. the level of circulating anti-6-integrin antibodies was determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay using 6-integrin fragments. antibodies against at least one recombinant fragment were found in approximately 30% of ps and psa patients. in contrast, in ra patients, the frequency of antibodies was similar to healthy controls. our study shows the presence of anti-6-integrin antibodies in ps and psa but not in ra, which could indicate ongoing abnormal processes in the skin. anti-6-integrin autoantibodies may contribute to the formation of micro-wounds in the skin and to the characteristic wound-healing phenotype in psoriasis.
psoriasis	objetive: to describe (structure, processes) of the multidisciplinary care models in psoriatic arthritis (psa) in spain, as well as barriers and facilitators of their implementation. methods: a qualitative study was performed following structured interviews with 24 professionals (12 rheumatologists, 12 dermatologists who provide multidisciplinary care for patients with psa). we collected data related to the hospital, department, population and multidisciplinary care model (type, physical and human resources, professional requirements, objectives, referral criteria, agendas, protocols, responsibilities, decision-making, research and education, clinical sessions, development and planning of the model, advantages and disadvantages of the model, barriers and facilitators in the implementation of the model. the models characteristics are described. results: we analyzed 12 multidisciplinary care models in psa, with at least 1-2 years of experience, and 3 subtypes of models, face-to-face, parallel, and preferential circuit. all are adapted to the hospital and professionals characteristics. a proper implementation planning is essential. the involvement and empathy between professionals and an access and well-defined referral criteria are important facilitators in the implementation of a model. the management of agendas and data collection to measure the multidisciplinary care models health outcomes are the main barriers. conclusions: there are different multidisciplinary care models in psa that can improve patient outcomes, system efficiency and collaboration between specialists.

psoriasis	background: although acitretin has been widely used for the treatment of psoriasis, additional safer and more effective approaches, including traditional chinese medicine, are needed. objectives: to investigate the efficacy and safety of total glucosides of paeony (tgp) combined with acitretin in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. materials & methods: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical study was conducted. in total, 108 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were randomly assigned to treatment with ""tgp plus acitretin"" (group a) or ""placebo plus acitretin"" (group b) for 12 weeks. results: after 12 weeks of therapy, the percentage of patients achieving a 50% reduction in psoriasis area and severity index was 90% in group a and 70.5% in group b (p<0.05). the rate of serum alanine aminotransferase elevation was 6.25% in group a and 20.4% in group b (p<0.05). conclusion: tgp is conducive to enhancing anti-psoriatic efficacy and reducing liver damage due to acitretin. tgp combined with acitretin is a safe and effective treatment approach for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
psoriasis	objective: to evaluate the relationship between the serum resistin levels and metabolic syndrome (mets) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (csu) patients. methods: in the study 42 csu patients and 42 healthy volunteers were included. height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure measurements were assesed for both of the groups. fasting blood sugar, serum lipid levels, resistin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were evaluated in the venous blood samples. the metabolic syndrome (mets) diagnosis was determined using the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel iii diagnostic criteria. results: mets was found in 14 (33.3%) csu patients and 5 (11.9%) control subjects. there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.037) in terms of mets presence. it was found that the mean serum resistin levels was 1928.31 +/- 212.85 pg/ml in the csu patients and 2107.60 +/- 156.71 pg/ml in the control group. there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of serum resistin levels. no difference was seen between the patients with and without a diagnosis of mets regarding the urticaria activity score, duration of the disease, autologous serum skin test positivity, serum immunoglobulin e levels, presence of autoimmunity, serum resistin and tnf-alpha levels. conclusion: an increased incidence of mets in the csu patient group is found in our study. however, there was no difference between the csu patients with and without mets regarding the disorder-associated parameters and the serum resistin and tnf-alpha levels.
psoriasis	psoriasis, a common disease affecting 2%-3% of the uk population, produces significant impairment of quality of life and is an immense burden on sufferers and their families. psoriasis is associated with significant cardiovascular comorbidity and the metabolic syndrome. angiogenesis, a relatively under-researched component of psoriasis, is a key factor in pathogenesis of psoriasis and also contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a well-established mediator of pathological angiogenesis which is upregulated in psoriasis. it is possible that, in patients with psoriasis, cutaneous angiogenesis may be both a marker for systemic vascular pathology and a novel therapeutic target. in this viewpoint study, the role of vegf-mediated angiogenesis as a cause for cardiovascular events in patients with psoriasis is explored.
psoriasis	although infliximab is approved for psoriasis, its efficacy is reduced over time in some patients. the aim of this phase iii trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of infliximab dose escalation in japanese psoriasis patients with loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy. patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, pustular psoriasis or psoriatic erythroderma who showed loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy received infliximab dose escalation (10 mg/kg every 8 weeks) from weeks 0 to 32. loss of efficacy was defined as not maintaining 50% reduction in the psoriasis area and severity index (pasi 50) after achieving pasi 75. efficacy and safety were evaluated up to week 40. fifty-one patients received dose escalation and 43 completed the study. pasi 75 and median improvement rate of pasi score at week 40 were 44% and 70.0%, respectively, showing efficacy in skin symptoms. efficacies in quality of life, nail psoriasis and joint pain were also obtained. median serum infliximab level increased from less than 0.1 to 1.1 g/ml from weeks 0 to 40, showing positive correlation between efficacy and serum infliximab level at week 40. favorable efficacy was observed in patients with detectable serum infliximab levels (0.1 g/ml) at baseline. incidences of adverse events, serious adverse events, serious infections and serious infusion reactions were 92%, 10%, 4% and 0%, respectively. no marked difference was observed in both efficacy and safety among psoriasis types. no new safety concerns were observed. infliximab dose escalation was effective and well-tolerated in psoriasis patients with loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy, suggesting that dose escalation may be a useful therapeutic option for these patients.
psoriasis	background/objective: the prevalence of selected psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, is higher in patients with psoriasis. however, the association between psoriasis and schizophrenia is less clear. here, we investigated whether the prevalence of schizophrenia is higher in patients with psoriasis. methods: in this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the 1-million-person cohort enrolled from taiwan 's national health insurance research database. psoriasis, schizophrenia, and comorbidities were ascertained by the international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification coding. for schizophrenia, the concomitant catastrophic illness certificate was used to verify the diagnosis. the prevalence of schizophrenia in patients with psoriasis was compared with the prevalence of schizophrenia in a comparable population using a generalized linear mixed model. results: the prevalence of schizophrenia was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis than in the comparison population [prevalence ratio = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.482.12, p < 0.0001)]. within the psoriasis cohort, patients aged between 40 years and 59 years had a higher odds ratio (or) for schizophrenia (or = 2.49, 95% ci = 1.554.00, p = 0.0002). furthermore, psoriatic patients with comorbid cerebrovascular disease (or = 2.01, 95% ci = 1.113.65, p = 0.0220) and chronic pulmonary disease (or = 1.64, 95% ci = 1.072.49, p = 0.0218) had higher odds for schizophrenia. conclusion: schizophrenia is more prevalent in patients with psoriasis. although the exact mechanisms remain to be clarified, the finding that psoriatic patients with comorbid cerebrovascular disease or chronic pulmonary disease have higher odds for schizophrenia may imply psoriatic patients with those comorbidities are likely to have higher inflammatory burden, which would contribute to the development of schizophrenia if a disruption of the bloodbrain barrier is present. further investigations are indicated to validate the hypothesis explaining the association between known comorbidies of psoriasis and schizophrenia. copyright (c) 2016, taiwanese dermatological association. published by elsevier taiwan llc.
psoriasis	psoriasis is a disease characterized by an imbalance between th-1 and th-17 and th-2 inflammatory axes, in which cutaneous mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) are early involved, as they show a greater relative expression of several genes encoding for th-1 and th-17 cytokines. therapeutic implications of tnf- inhibitors on differentiated skin cells have been largely described in psoriasis; however, their effects on mscs derived from patients with psoriasis have been only partially described. the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of tnf- inhibitors on cytokine milieu expressed by mscs isolated from the skin of patients with psoriasis. resident mscs from skin of patients with psoriasis and healthy subjects have been isolated, characterized and profiled by pcr and elisa for the expression of 22 cytokines involved in th-1, th-2 and th-17 pathways, both before and after 12weeks therapy with tnf- inhibitors. the administration of tnf- inhibitors for 12-weeks acts on mscs as follows: it reduces the expression of several th-1-th-17 cytokines whose levels are elevated at baseline (il-6, il-8, il-12, il-23a, ifn-, tnf-, ccl2, ccl20, cxcl2, cxcl5, il-17a, il-17c, il-17f, il-21, g-csf). similarly, it enhances the expression of several th-2 cytokines which are underexpressed at baseline (il-2, il-4, il-5), reducing the expression of those overexpressed at baseline (tgf- and il-13). tnf- inhibitors could contribute to reduce the pathological imbalance between the th-1-th-17 vs th-2 axis in mscs of patients with psoriasis.
psoriasis	leptin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine secreted mostly by adipose tissue. serum leptin levels are elevated in obese individuals and correlate positively with body mass index (bmi). interestingly, serum leptin levels are also elevated in patients with psoriasis and correlate positively with disease severity. psoriasis is associated with obesity; patients with psoriasis have a higher incidence of obesity, and obese individuals have a higher risk of developing psoriasis. additionally, obese patients with psoriasis experience a more severe degree of psoriasis. in this study, we hypothesised that leptin may link psoriasis and obesity and plays an aggravating role in psoriasis. to investigate leptin 's role in psoriasis, we applied the widely accepted imiquimod (imq)-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation mouse model on leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice and evaluated psoriasis severity. moreover, we stimulated human keratinocytes with leptin and investigated the effect on proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory proteins. in ob/ob mice, clinical signs of erythema, infiltration and scales in dorsal skin and inflammation in ear skin, as measured by ear thickness, were attenuated and compared with wt mice. moreover, il-17a and il-22 mrna expression levels, as well as increased epidermal thickness, were significantly less induced. in vitro, the effect of leptin stimulation on human keratinocytes demonstrated increased proliferation and induced secretion of several pro-inflammatory proteins; two hallmarks of psoriasis. in conclusion, leptin deficiency attenuated imq-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in a mouse model, and leptin stimulation induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in human keratinocytes, thus, supporting an aggravating role of leptin in psoriasis.
psoriasis	psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorder that impacts the skin and joints, with the propensity to produce devastating psychosocial, economic, and occupational effects. these are often not solitary; for example, psychological manifestations may impact one 's occupational and economic statuses. the purpose of this reviewis to raise awareness of these consequences of disease that clinicians may consider incorporating into a patient-centered model of care.
ankylosing_spondylitis	the purpose of this retrospective study is to report the clinical and radiological outcome of total hip arthroplasty in patients with previous hip arthrodesis. we retrospectively reviewed 28 (40 hips) prospectively followed patients in whom ankylosed hips were converted to total hip arthroplasty (tha) between 2010 and 2014 in our institution. the average age at the time of the conversion operation was 40.8 +/- 9.8 years (range 24-62). the ankylosis had lasted 20.4 +/- 13.0 years (range 3-56) before conversion surgery. the etiology of the ankylosis was septic arthritis in 10 (25%), post-traumatic hip osteoarthritis in 8 (20%), developmental hip dysplasia in 6 (15%), rheumatoid arthritis in 6 (15%), primary osteoarthritis in 5 (12.5%) and ankylosing spondylitis in 5 (12.5%) hips. the indications for arthroplasty were intractable low back pain in 14 (50%), hip pain in 24 (85.7%), and ipsilateral knee pain in 19 (67.8%) patients. harris hip score (hhs) was used to rate the clinical results before and after the surgery. radiographic evaluations included component malposition and loosening. all complications during the study period were recorded. the mean follow-up period was 39.9 +/- 10.6 months (range 24-60). the mean preoperative hhs was 33.3 +/- 8.6 (range 18-50) and the mean hhs at the final follow-up was 74.9 +/- 8.6 (range 52-97). there was a statistically significant increase in hhs (p = 0.0001). hhs was excellent in 1, good in 6, fair in 14 and poor in 7 patients. increase in hhs was lower than 20 points in one patient (18 points), and one patient required two-staged exchange procedure due to deep infection. thus, according to our success criteria (increase in hhs more than 20 points, radiographically stable implant, and no further surgical reconstruction), 92.8% (26/28) of patients had benefit from the surgery. trendelenburg sign was positive in 12 hips. there was limb length inequality in 11 patients (mean 0.5 cm, range 1-3 cm). no patients had heterotopic ossification, sciatic nerve palsy or dislocation. there were five intra-operative fractures of the greater trochanter that were treated with cable wiring. one patient had trochanteric avulsion injury and was treated with trochanteric grip and cables. one patient (2.5%) had deep infection one year after the conversion tha and was treated with two-staged exchange procedure. conversion hip arthroplasty is an effective treatment method which provides functional recovery and patient satisfaction. however, a proper surgical technique and planning is necessary to minimize the complications.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: the transcription factor ets1 is highly expressed in b lymphocytes. loss of ets1 leads to premature b cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells (ascs), secretion of autoantibodies, and development of autoimmune disease. despite the importance of ets1 in b cell biology, few ets1 target genes are known in these cells. results: to obtain a more complete picture of the function of ets1 in regulating b cell differentiation, we performed ets1 chip-seq in primary mouse b cells to identify >10,000-binding sites, many of which were localized near genes that play important roles in b cell activation and differentiation. although ets1 bound to many sites in the genome, it was required for regulation of less than 5% of them as evidenced by gene expression changes in b cells lacking ets1. the cohort of genes whose expression was altered included numerous genes that have been associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility. we focused our attention on four such ets1 target genes ptpn22, stat4, egr1, and prdm1 to assess how they might contribute to ets1 function in limiting asc formation. we found that dysregulation of these particular targets cannot explain altered asc differentiation in the absence of ets1. conclusion: we have identified genome-wide binding targets for ets1 in b cells and determined that a relatively small number of these putative target genes require ets1 for their normal expression. interestingly, a cohort of genes associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility is among those that are regulated by ets1. identification of the target genes of ets1 in b cells will help provide a clearer picture of how ets1 regulates b cell responses and how its loss promotes autoantibody secretion.
ankylosing_spondylitis	psoriasis can be managed successfully with long-term biologics. real-life clinical practice may require dose tapering as a therapeutic option to reduce the risk of drug-exposure and to increase cost-effectiveness. the responsiveness to extended intervals between adalimumab doses and the possible predictive factors of maintenance of complete clearance were studied in a retrospective 7-year single-centre analysis. thirty patients who achieved complete clearance with adalimumab underwent dose tapering, progressively extending between-dose intervals (to 21-28 days). sixty percent of subjects (group a) maintained complete clearance, whereas 40.0% (group b) relapsed and were switched back to the standard dosage to re-achieve complete clearance. body mass index (bmi) and time to achieve psoriasis area severity index (pasi-100) with adalimumab standard treatment before dose tapering were significantly lower in group a than in group b (multivariate cox regression: p < 0.05, kaplan-meier analysis: p < 0.001, respectively). this study suggests that patients with lower bmi and shorter time to achieve pasi-100 with adalimumab standard dose were significantly more likely to be candidates for dose tapering.
ankylosing_spondylitis	introduction: early diagnosis, monitoring of disease activity, prediction of treatment response, and structural outcome remain major challenges in spondyloarthritis (spa). biomarkers could play a role in addressing these challenges, but in spa there is a lack of suitable biomarkers.areas covered: as spa is clinically and pathophysiologically closely related to psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), we reviewed in literature, the value of serum biomarkers in these conditions with the aim to find potential candidates for assessing spa.expert commentary: candidates of interest were antimicrobial peptides, including serum human beta defensin-2 (hbd-2) and lipocalin-2 (lcn-2), and class-1 mhc molecule beta2-microglobulin. since these biomarkers are relevant in psoriasis and/or ibd from a pathophysiological point of view, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of spa, we recommend further exploration of their value as biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of spa.
ankylosing_spondylitis	patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and ankylosing spondylitis (as) have increased cardiovascular (cv) morbidity and mortality. arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cv events. the aim of the study was to assess arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers in patients with short duration chronic arthritis. we assessed carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (pwv), augmentation index (aix), traditional cv risk factors and inflammatory and endothelial markers in 71 chronic arthritis patients (ra and as) and in 29 healthy controls. we did not find differences in pwv (for ra, as and controls, respectively: 10 [8.8-10.9] versus 10.7 [9.1-11.8] versus 9.2 [8.3-11.4] m/s; p=.14) and aix (for ra, as and controls, respectively: 24.3 +/- 11.5 versus 5.7 +/- 12.4 versus 10 +/- 12.8%; p=.22). both groups of arthritis patients had active disease with significantly elevated inflammatory markers compared to controls. there were no correlations between endothelial and inflammatory markers and parameters of arterial stiffness in arthritis patients. when analyzing arthritis patients according to median of pvw, there were no significant differences in inflammatory and endothelial markers. we found that in patients with short duration active ra and as arterial stiffness was not increased and furthermore, there was no association between markers of systemic inflammation and arterial stiffness.
ankylosing_spondylitis	meloxicam, a bcs class ii drug belonging to the class of nsaids is indicated in conditions of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and osteoarthritis in which rapid onset of drug action is desired to reduce inflammation and pain. the objective of the study was to thus develop self nanoemulsifying granules (snegs) of meloxicam (mlx) for enhancement of solubility; and subsequently dissolution rate, thus aiming for a faster onset of action. preliminary studies along with molecular modeling studies were carried out for selection of appropriate lipids, surfactants and cosurfactants for the development of mlx-loaded self nanoemulsifying preconcentrate (snep). a charge inducer was incorporated into the formulation so as to increase the solubility of mlx in lipids and hence, drug loading. a three-factor d-optimal mixture design was used for optimization of mlx loaded snep. the role of charge inducer in increasing the drug loading of mlx in snedds was studied by molecular dynamics simulation using desmond. optimized snep was adsorbed onto solid carriers to form snegs for improved stability and enhanced flow properties. physical characterization studies of snegs, in vitro release studies, and in vivo evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of the optimized formulation were performed. all the results indicated that mlx snegs can be a promising alternative to conventional oral nsaids therapy because of enhanced dissolution characteristics and subsequent rapid onset of action.
ankylosing_spondylitis	despite intensive research in spondyloarthritis pathogenesis, some important questions still remain unanswered, particularly concerning enthesis new bone formation. several evidences suggest that it prevalently occurs by endochondral ossification, however it remains to identify factors that can induce and influence its initiation and progression. recent progress, achieved in animal models and in vitro and genetic association studies, has led us to hypothesize that several systemic factors (adipokines and gut hormones) and local factors (bmp and wnt signaling) as well as angiogenesis and mechanical stress are involved. we critically review and summarize the available data and delineate the possible mechanisms involved in enthesis ossification, particularly at spinal ligament level. key messages complete understanding of spondyloarthritis pathophysiology requires insights into inflammation, bone destruction and bone formation, which are all located in entheses and lead all together to ankylosis and functional disability. several factors probably play a role in the pathogenesis of bone formation in entheses including not only cytokines but also several systemic factors such as adipokines and gut hormones, and local factors, such as bmp and wnt signaling, as well as angiogenesis and mechanical stress. data available about pathophysiology of new bone formation in spondyloarthritis are limited and often conflicting and future studies are needed to better delineate it and to develop new therapeutic approaches.
ankylosing_spondylitis	the clinical importance of the thyroid nodules in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (ax-spa) rests with the need to exclude thyroid malignancy. the aim of this study is to assess the risk of thyroid malignancy in ax-spa patients receiving anti-tnf therapy. from september 2015 until december 2015, 70 patients diagnosed with ax-spa were included in the research. forty of the patients had received anti-tnf therapy, and 30 of the patients were anti-tnf naive. all cases were screened for the presence of nodules in the thyroid gland with ultrasound. of the patients that received anti-tnf therapy, 15 (37.5%); and of the anti-tnf naive patients, 11 (36.7%) had thyroid nodule(s). four patients from the anti-tnf group underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy of the nodules, and two of them were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma. none of the nodules in anti-tnf naive patients required biopsy. when compared to the normal population, the standardized incidence ratio (sir) was found to be increased in both male (sir 2.03, 95% ci 1.9 to 18) and female (sir 2.7, 95% ci 2.6 to 24) cases. it is not yet established whether the development of cancer during the treatment process is the effect of the treatment or if it is a part of the natural course of the disease or if it is coincidental. we saw a mild increase in thyroid malignancies in ax-spa patients who received anti-tnf therapy. therefore, we believe that the thyroid gland should also be taken into consideration while screening for malignancy before anti-tnf therapy.
ankylosing_spondylitis	erap1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) are associated with ankylosing spondylitis. data on erap1snps in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) is scarce. erap1 rs30187 snp was shown to confer risk in the enthesitis-related arthritis (era) category of jia. we examined the prevalence and association of this snp in indian children with era. snps in erap1 (rs30187) were genotyped in children with era (n = 271), ankylosing spondylitis (as) (n = 213) and healthy controls (n = 101), using taqman genotyping. allele frequencies and genotype frequencies were calculated and compared using the cochran armitage test. minor allele frequencies were 0.52 in era, 0.57 in as, and 0.57 in healthy controls. neither era nor as patients showed significant association with this snp. segregating according to hlab27 status did not alter the lack of association. rs30187 snp in erap1 does not confer risk of developing era or as in the asian indian population.
ankylosing_spondylitis	in a sidonian sarcophagus, from the late antique/early christian period, skeletal remains of two persons were found. one of them, male, 30-50 years old, was found almost completely ankylosed, with highly osteoporotic bones and prominent erosion of joint surfaces. we diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis based on the eroded odontoid process, mandibular condyles, distal humerus, proximal and distal ulna, as well ankylosed hand and foot bones. despite the fact that ankyloses of vertebrae and sacroiliac joint could point towards ankylosing spondylitis, the lack of typical vertebral ankyloses and new bone formation led to exclusion. in a practical sense, due to the advanced stage of the disease, the man was fixed in the supine position, on the left, with his head turned to the right. apparently, he could not move and had problems with chewing and breathing. but, the high standard of provided healthcare probably enabled him to survive in advanced stages of the disease. this case shed light on the antiquity of the disease, its medical, and social context and provided the example of most extreme osteological changes reported in the paleopathological and medical literature.
children's_health	background: treatment guidelines for asthma have been established based on asthma severity; there are limitations in the identification of underlying pathophysiology and prediction of prognosis in heterogeneous phenotypes of asthma. although the complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors affect the development and progression of asthma, studies on asthma phenotypes considering environmental factors are limited. this study aimed to identify asthma phenotypes using latent class analysis including environmental factors in school-age children. methods: we included 235 children (6-8 years) with parent-reported, physician-diagnosed asthma from the children 's health and environmental research (cheer) study, which is a 4-year prospective follow-up study with 2-year intervals. at every survey, pulmonary function tests, methacholine challenge tests and blood tests with questionnaire were conducted. results: four asthma phenotypes were identified. cluster 1 (22% of children) was characterized by high prevalence of atopy and mild symptoms; subjects in cluster 2 (17%) consisted of less atopy and normal lung function, but intermittent troublesome; cluster 3 (29%) experienced late-onset atopic troublesome asthma with decreased lung function in combination with low socioeconomic status; and cluster 4 was associated with early-onset and less-atopic infrequent asthma. conclusions: late-onset, high atopy, and low socioeconomic status are associated with troublesome persistent asthma phenotype in school-age children. environmental factors might be implicated in the clinical heterogeneity of asthma. asthma phenotypes considering diverse factors might be more helpful in the identification of asthma pathogenesis and its prevention.
children's_health	objective:maternal depression affects 10% to 40% of mothers with young children and has negative consequences for children 's health and development. the american academy of pediatrics (aap) recommends that pediatricians identify women with maternal depression. the authors examined trends in inquiring about (asking informal questions) or screening for (using a standardized instrument) maternal depression by pediatricians in 2004 and 2013 and identified correlates of usually inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression.methods:data were ascertained from 778 nontrainee pediatricians exclusively practicing general pediatrics who completed the 2004 (n = 457) and 2013 (n = 321) aap periodic surveys. pediatricians answered questions about physician and practice characteristics, training, attitudes, and inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression. sample weights were used to reduce nonresponse bias. weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted.results:the prevalence of usually inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression increased from 33% to 44% (p < .01). in both years, pediatricians who usually inquired about child/adolescent depression had increased odds of usually inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression. patient race/ethnicity and training in adult diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm) diagnostic criteria for depression were associated with inquiring/screening in 2004, and believing that family screening is within the scope of the pediatrician was associated with inquiring/screening in 2013.conclusion:although inquiring/screening about maternal depression has increased since 2004, less than half of pediatricians usually screen or inquire about maternal depression, representing a missed opportunity to identify depression and manage or refer women for treatment. further training on the importance of mental and family health to children 's health may increase identification of maternal depression in pediatric primary care.
children's_health	child health literacy is a 'hot topic' of late, as researchers and practitioners work to attain an equitable and healthy future. health literacy emphasizes the wide range of skills that people need to access, understand, evaluate and use health information to promote good health. in light of the recognition that health literacy is an important determinant of health for adults, addressing child health literacy early on is essential to maximize future health outcomes. meeting children 's specific needs arguably includes the delivery of information that can be easily accessed and understood by younger age groups. while much academic discourse pertains to the importance of building parental health literacy, there is less literature that explicitly focuses on child-centred health literacy. on the premise that health literacy is an asset, this paper provides an argument for investing in children 's health literacy by working with children to encourage meaningful contributions in research and practice.
children's_health	fifty percent of inborn errors of metabolism are present in later childhood and adulthood, with crises commonly precipitated by minor viral illnesses or increased protein ingestion. many physicians only consider iem after more common conditions (such as sepsis) have been considered. in view of the large number of inborn errors, it might appear that their diagnosis requires precise knowledge of a large number of biochemical pathways and their interrelationship. as a matter of fact, an adequate diagnostic approach can be based on the proper use of only a few screening tests. a detailed history of antecedent events, together with these simple screening tests, can be diagnostic, leading to life-saving, targeted treatments for many disorders. unrecognised, iem can lead to significant mortality and morbidity. advice is available 24/7 through the metabolic service based at the major paediatric hospital in each state and starship children 's health in new zealand.
children's_health	purpose of review the purpose of this review is to identify emerging developmental toxicants that are understudied in children 's health. exposures may arise from new products designed to improve utility, to reduce toxicity, or to replace undesirable chemicals. exposures to less-toxic chemicals may also be significant if they are very commonly used, thereby generating widespread exposure. sources of exposure include the workplace, personal, home, and office products; food, water, and air. recent findings we describe eight exposure categories that contain numerous potential developmental toxicants. references are discussed if reported in pubmed during the past decade at least 10 times more frequently than in 1990-2000. examples included phthalates, phenols, sunscreens, pesticides, halogenated flame retardants, perfluoroalkyl coatings, nanoparticles, e-cigarettes, and dietary polyphenols. replacements are often close structural homologs of their precursors. we suggest biomonitoring as preferred means of exposure assessment to emerging chemicals. some existing analytic methods would require minimal modification to measure these exposures, but others require toxicokinetic and analytic investigation. summary a deliberate strategy for biomonitoring of emerging replacement chemicals is warranted, especially in view of concerns regarding developmental toxicity. to prevent adverse health effects, it is important to characterize such exposures before they become widely disseminated.
children's_health	objective: to test the hypotheses that children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) have higher screen time than other children on a us nationally representative sample and that children with asd are overrepresented among children who exceed the american academy of pediatrics (aap) screen time recommendation (2 hours or less a day). methods: the national survey of children 's health 2011-2012, a nationally representative survey, asked parents to report their child 's (aged 6-17 years) average daily media usage. the asd subpopulation (n = 1393) was compared to children without asd (non-asd, n = 64,163). differences were compared by design-corrected f tests. regression models were estimated for both groups separately. adjusted wald tests were used to rigorously test the hypotheses. results: more than half of us children exceed the aap screen time recommendation. compared to non-asd, children with asd had similar amounts of total screen time (3.21 hours per day vs,3.46 hours per day; p >.05), media (tv/video) time, and computer/mobile device leisure time. children with asd have a milder age gradient than the general population on computer/mobile device usage. children with asd were proportionally represented among high users (more than 2 hours per day). data did not support hypotheses. conclusions: in a large, nationally representative us sample, there was no evidence that children with asd differ in their screen time habits from other children. both groups have high screen time use. caution should be exercised before assuming that children with asd are at higher risk of exceeding aap screen time recommendations. efforts to promote adherence to the recommendation are needed, but they should neither target nor exclude children with asd.
children's_health	an overall investigation of children 's health status, residential thermal environment, and pollutants was conducted in the homes primary school children during winter and summer in shanghai, china. the houses were divided into group a (unhealthy child living) and group b (healthy child living). during a two-week monitoring period in winter, indoor temperatures in group a were significantly lower than in group b (1-2 degrees c; p < 0.001). relative humidity (rh) of group a were 5-8% higher than group b (p70% of group a was around 0.6 in winter. bad thermal environment in group a was a risk factor for children 's health. average winter co2 concentrations were 758 ppm in group a and 701 ppm in group b, and the houses had poor ventilation during nighttime. indoor concentrations of formaldehyde (hcho), acetaldehyde and tvoc generally satisfied the chinese national standards. however, indoor pm2.5 and pm10 concentrations in group a were higher than those of group b, and pm concentrations in all investigated houses exceeded the chinese national standards in winter. dibutyl phthalate (dbp) and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (dehp) in house dust of four living rooms showed very high concentrations (3-4 times the eu recommended limit of 1000 mu g/g). aspergillus and cladosporium in room air and house dust were linked to high rh, and could be suspected association with poor children 's health. this study provides comprehensive information on indoor thermal and environmental conditions in houses in shanghai, and their exposures of primary schoolchildren to these health risks.

children's_health	background: skipping breakfast was found to be associated with abdominal obesity in primary school children. the aim of this research was to examine factors associated with skipping breakfast in primary school children in order to develop targeted preventive measures. methods: baseline data assessment (2010) of a cluster-randomized controlled trial for the evaluation of a school-based health promotion program in primary school children in the state of baden-wurttemberg, germany. anthropometric measures of 1,943 primary school children aged 7.1 +/- 0.6 years (51.2% boys) were conducted according to isak-standards (international standard for anthropometric assessment) by trained staff. further information on the health and living conditions of the children and their parents were assessed in parental questionnaires. generalized linear mixed regression analysis was calculated to define correlates for skipping breakfast in terms of odds ratios (or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). results: according to the final regression models, significant correlates of skipping breakfast can be divided into modifiable behavioral components (high consumption of soft drinks ( or 2.49, 95% ci 1.81; 3.43), screen media (or 2.48, 95% ci 1.77; 3.46) and high levels of physical activity (or 0.64, 95% ci 0.44; 0.93)) on the one hand, and more or less static socio-economic factors (migration background (or 2.81, 95% ci 2.02; 3.91), single parenting (or 2.13, 95% ci 1.34; 3.40), and high family education level (or 0.42, 95% ci 0.28; 0.64)) on the other hand, and finally individual factors ( female gender (or 1.43, 95% ci 1.03; 1.99) and having a percentage of body fat at or above the 95th percentile (or 1.47, 95% ci 1.00; 2.17)). conclusion: targeted prevention should aim at health-related behaviors accompanying the habit of skipping breakfast. focusing on vulnerable groups, characterized by not so easily modifiable socio-economic as well as individual factors, may improve results. interventions should synergistically promote children 's health and involve their parents in order to be successful. to reach all children and to avoid skipping breakfast, schools should offer regular breakfast at the start of a school day. policy makers should support healthy eating habits at all times.
children's_health	objective: the aim of this study is to present data concerning children 's participation in the german preventive medical examinations for children (""u2"" to ""u8"") in accordance with sections 26 and 92 of the german social code (book v) as retrospectively recorded by the public health service (""offentlicher gesundheitsdienst"") of the german province of saxony-anhalt during school entry medical examinations. also we wanted to analyse the additional variables recorded per child in the areas of social factors, diagnostic findings and levels of therapeutic care in connection with their degree of participation in the preventive medical examinations. methodology: the statistical analysis of 73 628 anonymised data sets from the health monitoring system of the german province of saxony-anhalt that were collected by the 14 health authorities in saxony-anhalt during school entry medical examinations between 2008 and 2012. an analysis of the data for 20 variables per child was performed with regard to the influence of their degree of participation in the u2 to u8 medical examinations using differences in frequency in the examination groups and checking the significance of these differences by means of the chi-squared test. results: 99-96 % of children in saxony-anhalt underwent the 5 preventive medical examinations u2-u6. as the children get older, the participation rates decrease (u2 = 98.7% down to u8 = 88.5%). by the time the school entry medical examinations are carried out (at an average age of 63 months), 83 % of the children have undergone all 7 preventive medical examinations for children, while 0.4% have not undergone one single ""u"" examination. a child 's gender has no influence on its parents' decision as to whether or not it should undergo the examinations. the results also reveal that children who attend day care facilities are significantly more likely to have undergone all of the u examinations (84.8%) than children who are cared for at home (55.1%). conclusion: the retrospective comprehensive collection of data concerning the children 's degree of participation in preventive medical examinations using the school entry medical examination is suitable for identifying connections between participation rates and the social factors, diagnostic findings and levels of therapeutic care of the children in question.
children's_health	despite eliminating incidences of many diseases in the united states, parents are increasingly rejecting vaccines for their children. this article examines the reasons parents offer for doing so. it argues that parents construct a dichotomy between the natural and the artificial, in which vaccines come to be seen as unnecessary, ineffective, and potentially dangerous. using qualitative data from interviews and observations, this article shows first, how parents view their children 's bodies, particularly from experiences of birth and with infants, as naturally perfect and in need of protection. second, parents see vaccines as an artificial intervention that enters the body unnaturally, through injection. third, parents perceive immunity occurring from illness to be natural and superior and immunity derived from vaccines as inferior and potentially dangerous. finally, parents highlight the ways their own natural living serves to enhance their children 's immunity rendering vaccines unnecessary. taken together, this dichotomy allows parents to justify rejection of vaccines as a form of protecting children 's health. these findings expose perceptions of science, technology, health, and the meanings of the body in ways that can inform public health efforts.

stress_management	transition to university is stressful and successful adjustment is imperative for well-being. historically research on transitional stress focussed on negative outcomes and ill health. this is the first uk study applying a positive psychology approach to investigate the characteristics that facilitate adjustment among new university students. a range of psychological strengths conceptualised as covitality factors, shown individually to influence the stress and subjective well-being (swb) relationship were assessed among 192 first year uk undergraduates in week three of their first semester and again 6 months later. path analyses revealed that optimism mediated the relationship between stress and negative affect (a component of swb) over time, and academic self-efficacy demonstrated significant relationships with life satisfaction and positive affect. contrary to predictions, stress levels remained stable over time although academic alienation increased and self-efficacy decreased. optimism emerged as a key factor for new students to adjust to university, helping to buffer the impact of stress on well-being throughout the academic year. incorporating stress management and psycho-educational interventions to develop strengths is discussed as a way of promoting confidence and agency in new students to help them cope better with the stress at university.
stress_management	aimto identify core antecedents of job stress and job satisfaction, and to explore the potential of stress interventions to improve job satisfaction. backgrounddecreased job satisfaction for nurses is strongly associated with increased job stress. stress management strategies might have the potential to improve job satisfaction. evaluationcomparative scoping review of studies (2000-2013) and location of their outcomes within the job demands-job resources' (jd-r) model of stress to identify commonalities and trends. discussionmany, but not all, antecedents of both phenomena appeared consistently suggesting they are common mediators. others were more variable but the appearance of emotional demands' as a common antecedent in later studies suggests an evolving influence of the changing work environment. the occurrence of shift work' as a common issue in later studies points to further implications for nurses' psychosocial well-being. conclusionsjob satisfaction problems in nursing might be co-responsive to stress management intervention. improving the buffering effectiveness of increased resilience and of prominent perceived job resource issues are urgently required. implications for nursing managementparticipatory, psychosocial methods have the potential to raise job resources but will require high-level collaboration by stakeholders, and participative leadership and facilitation by managers to enable better decision-latitude, support for action planning and responsive changes.
stress_management	the demand for infrared transmitting materials has grown steadily for several decades as markets realize new applications for longer wavelength sensing and imaging. with this growth has come the demand for new and challenging material requirements that cannot be satisfied with crystalline products alone. chalcogenide materials, with their unique physical, thermal, and optical properties, have found acceptance by designers and fabricators to meet these demands. no material is perfect in every regard, and chalcogenides are no exception. a cause for concern has been the relatively low fracture toughness and the propensity of the bulk material to fracture. this condition is amplified when traditional subtractive manufacturing processes are employed. this form of processing leaves behind micro fractures and sub surface damage, which act as propagation points for both local and catastrophic failure of the material. precision lens molding is not a subtractive process, and as a result, micro fractures and sub surface damage are not created. this results in a stronger component than one produced by traditional methods. new processing methods have also been identified that result in an even stronger surface that is more resistant to breakage, without the need for post processing techniques that may compromise surface integrity. this paper will discuss results achieved in the process of lens molding development at edmund optics that result in measurably stronger chalcogenide components. various metrics will be examined and data will be presented that quantifies component strength for different manufacturing processes.acute limb ischemia is one of the most common peripheral arterial disease, while surgical restoration of blood flow often results in ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury. our previous study revealed the inflammation intensity in arterial tissue, characterized by expression of high mobility group box protein 1 (hmgb1), was contrary to the fluctuation of hemodynamics in reperfusion limbs in a rat model. this study meant to clarify the role of hmgb1 during this process. laser doppler perfusion imaging evaluated limb hemodynamics in mean and max perfusion unit (pu). femoral arterial tissue was collected for molecular biology examination. the results revealed that hmgb1 promoted vascular structure remodeling and vasomotor dysfunction during acute i/r, characterized by degradation of collagenous fibers, disruption of elastic lamellae, intensive inflammation and phenotype transfer of smooth muscle cells. blockade of hmgb1 preserved vascular homeostasis and improved pus (p-meanpu < 0.001, p-maxpu < 0.001). the elevated expression of tnf-alpha, il-6, icam, vcam, mmp-2, mmp-9, alpha-sm actin correlated with hmgb1 positively. in conclusion, hmgb1 promoted vascular remodeling and dysfunction via initiating an inflammation cascade during i/r. blockade of hmgb1 would preserve vascular homeostasis and facilitate the blood perfusion of ischemic limb.

stress_management	purpose. to test an ipad-delivered multiple behavior tailored intervention (healthy pregnancy: step by step) for pregnant women that addresses smoking cessation, stress management, and fruit and vegetable consumption. design. a randomized 2 x 5 factorial repeated measures design was employed with randomization on the individual level stratified on behavior risk. women completed three sessions during pregnancy and two postpartum at postdelivery months 1 and 4. setting. women were recruited from six locations of federally funded health centers across three states. subjects. participants (n = 335) were english-and spanish-speaking women at up to 18 weeks gestation. intervention. the treatment group received three interactive sessions focused on two priority health behavior risks. the sessions offered individually tailored and stage-matched change strategies based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change. the usual care group received march of dimes brochures. measures. the primary outcome was the number of behavior risks. stage of change and continuous measures for all behaviors also were assessed. analysis. data were analyzed across all time points using generalized estimating equations examining repeated measures effects. results. women in the treatment group reported significantly fewer risks than those in usual care at 1 month (.85 vs. 1.20, odds ratio [or] = .70) and 4 months postpartum (.72 vs. .91, or = .81). conclusion. healthy pregnancy is an evidence-based and personalized program that assists pregnant women with reducing behavior risks and sustaining healthy lifestyle behaviors.
stress_management	background: perceptions of appropriateness of treatments may differ between gastroenterologists (gis) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients. the aim of this study was to explore and compare gis' and patients' perceptions of risks and benefits of treatments and prioritization of expected outcomes.methods: four vignette cases were drawn from clinical situations and used in three independent focus groups with gis (n=7), ulcerative colitis (uc-p, n=8) and crohn 's disease patients (cd-p, n=6). content analysis was performed based on the conversation transcripts.results: uc-p agreed more often with gis' treatment choices than cd-p. cd-p often considered 5-asa as a placebo. uc-p saw topical 5-asa as a temporary solution, neither comfortable nor practical when professionally active. azathioprine was considered as the treatment for which the risks versus benefits were perceived as the highest. the main risk perceived by patients on anti-tnfs was a potential loss of response. divergences were observed on 1) stop of treatment: uc-p did not easily concur with stopping a treatment, which differed from gis' expectation of patients' perceptions; cd-p were more prone to consider stopping treatment than gis, 2) perception of outcomes: physicians had a focus on long-term objective goals. patients' expectations were of shorter term and mainly concerned stress management, nutritional advice, and information on the treatments effects.conclusions: overall, patients and gis agreed on perceptions of ibd treatments. gis seemed more concerned about objective and scientific measures of remission whereas patients focused on quality of life and social outcomes when it came to evaluating a therapy.
stress_management	a persistent assumption across the psychological literature is that talking and writing about one 's stress is inherently more beneficial than avoiding it. this study compared the effects of these stress management strategies on personal and relational health. two hundred and fifty-one dating individuals focused on a stressor that was a current source of rumination. writing about one 's stressor for 5 consecutive days (without talking about it) decreased anxiety the most. talking continuously about one 's stressor to a dating partner harmed the relationship more than writing about or avoiding it. the effect of talking repeatedly about one 's stressor on relationship quality and brooding, however, depended upon the emotional support received from one 's dating partner and the ability to reappraise (positively or neutrally) the stressor.
stress_management	this study explored the impact of staff group role and length of organizational tenure in the relationship between the awareness of stress interventions (termed intervention awareness: ia) and the work-related attitudinal outcomes of university employees. a two-wave longitudinal study of a sample of 869 employees from 13 universities completed a psychosocial work factors and health questionnaire. hierarchical regression analyses examined the contribution of staff role and different lengths of organizational tenure with ia and employees' reports of job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, trust in senior management, and perceived procedural justice. employees' length of tenure affected the relation between ia and work attitudes, and there were also differences between academic and non-academic staff groups. for non-academic employees. ia predicted job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, trust in senior management, and perceived procedural justice. however, for academics, ia only predicted job satisfaction and trust which identifies a need to increase the visibility of organizational interventions. across the tenure groups. ia predicted: (1) perceived procedural justice for employees with five or less years of tenure; (2) job satisfaction for employees with 0-19 years of tenure; (3) trust in senior management for employees with 6-19 years of tenure; and (4) affective organizational commitment for employees with a tenure length of 6-10 years. employees working at the university for an intermediate period had the most positive perceptions of their organization in terms of ia, job satisfaction, trust in senior management, and affective organizational commitment, whereas employees with 20-38 years of tenure had the least positive perceptions. results suggest that employees in the middle of their careers report the most positive perceptions of their university. the findings highlight the need to attend to contextual issues in organizational stress and wellbeing interventions and suggest that management may need to implement new strategies and/or promote existing stress-management and reduction strategies to academics, and employees whom are either new to the university or those who have been working for the organization for longer periods of time to ensure that they are aware of organizational strategies to promote employee wellbeing and morale within their work environments.
stress_management	background: individual dispositions have previously been associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms. the direction of the association has been found to be sometimes reciprocal. we examined whether temperament traits are associated with depressive symptoms and whether depressive symptoms contribute to changes in temperament. methods: participants (n=674-811) were from a population-based young finns study. temperament was assessed by a finnish version of the formal characteristics of behavior - temperament inventory. depressive symptoms were assessed with modified bdi (mbdi) in 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2012, and bdi-ii in 2012. results: higher perseveration and emotional reactivity were associated with higher level of depressive symptoms, and higher endurance was associated with lower level of depressive symptoms in 2007 and 2012. these associations were independent of several potential confounders and baseline depressive symptoms. the results of cross-lagged structural equation modeling showed that the associations between temperament and depressive symptoms were reciprocal: briskness, endurance and activity decreased the risk for depressive symptoms while depressive symptoms decreased the level of these characteristics. perseveration, emotional reactivity and depressive symptoms reinforced each other over time. limitations: the depressive symptoms scales we used are not meant for measuring clinically diagnosed depression. the relationships between temperament traits and depressive symptoms were not strong enough to provide a clinical basis for guiding treatment. conclusions: lower perseveration, lower emotional reactivity and higher endurance seem to be health protective temperament characteristics that reduce the risk for depressive symptoms. the reciprocal associations between temperament and depressive symptoms imply mutual health protective and health declining effects. clinical relevance of the study is that enhancing positive loops and self-concept, and supporting individual stress management might be helpful in prevention of depressive symptoms.

stress_management	investigation of correlation between the way of life of women-secular and devoted (belonging to a christian orthodox fraternity)-and their stress management skills. sample population consisted of 200 women, 100 belonging to an orthodox christian fraternity and 100 secular women, 18 years of age and older from the wider thessaloniki area (north greece). antonovsky 's scale sense of coherence (soc) was used for stress management skills evaluation. the mean soc score was 138 (95 % ci 133.9-142.1) for secular and 149.9 (95 % ci 144.9-154.9) for devoted women. the presence of a strong sense of coherence for those women belonging to the fraternity (p = 0.004) and older age (p = 0.019) correlate with higher soc scores. religiousness appears to enhance stress management skills in women although additional evidence needs in support of the findings of this research.
stress_management	the aim of this study was to analyse the development of the different dimensions of emotional intelligence in adolescents over one school year and in a cross-sectional study involving 484 adolescents of both sexes from the six school years between year 1 of spanish secondary school (age 12-13) and year 2 of the spanish baccalaureate (age 17-18). participants were administered the spanish version of the emotional quotient inventory: young version short (caraballo & villegas, 2001). consistently with most previous research, the findings indicate that, except for the stress management dimension in the female sample group, none of the dimensions of emotional intelligence undergo substantial changes in relation to age.
hiv_aids	design: we have previously shown that ifn-alpha stimulation augments direct natural killer (nk) cell lysis of autologous cd4(+) primary t cells infected with certain hiv-1 isolates based upon major histocompatibility complex class 1 (mhc-1) downregulation capacity. here, we investigated if antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) could trigger lysis of hiv-1 isolates that were resistant to direct nk lysis and if ifn-alpha prestimulation of nk cells could further enhance adcc. methods: using broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against gp120 (vrc01 or pgv04) or plasma from hiv-1infected patients (art-suppressed or elite controller) to trigger adcc, we measured nk cell chromium release cytotoxicity against hiv-1- infected autologous cd4(+) primary t cells and nk cell cd107a degranulation against gp120-coated cd4(+) t cells. total or nk-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effectors in the presence or absence of ifn-alpha prestimulation. results: plasma from hiv-1- infected patients and monoclonal antibodies against gp120 could trigger nk-dependent adcc lysis of viral isolates that were resistant to direct nk cell lysis following ifn-alpha stimulation. in contrast, viral isolates that exhibited potent mhc-i downregulation capacity could be lysed by nk cells through either ifn-alpha stimulated direct cytotoxicity or through adcc. when utilized in combination, ifn-alpha prestimulation significantly augmented adcc lysis of hiv-1- infected target cells and increased nk cell cd107a degranulation against gp120-coated adcc targets (p < 0.05, n = 6). conclusion: hiv-1 isolates with lower mhc-i downregulation capacity are resistant to direct lysis following ifn-alpha stimulation but retain sensitivity to adcc. ifn-alpha prestimulation can significantly increase nk-mediated clearance of hiv-1- infected target cells by both adcc and/or direct cytotoxicity depending on mhc downregulation status. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
hiv_aids	objective. although emerging in western industrialized societies, limited research exists on the links between housing and health outcomes for persons living with hiv/aids (plwhas) in sub-saharan africa (ssa). methods. using survey data collected from 605 plwhas in the lower manya krobo district of ghana, this paper examined the effects of housing structure, arrangements, accessibility and conditions on the physical and psychological/emotional health of respondents. results. results indicate that housing variables have independent effects on health outcomes, controlling for socio-economic and demographic variables. respondents living in poor housing structures and deplorable housing conditions had poorer physical and psychological health scores. conclusion. the findings suggest that it is relevant to think about houses occupied by plwhas as important sources of health inequality.
hiv_aids	rural south african men who have sex with men (msm) are likely to be underserved in terms of access to relevant healthcare and hiv prevention services. while research in urban and peri-urban msm populations has identified a range of factors affecting hiv risk in south african msm, very little research is available that examines hiv risk and prevention in rural msm populations. this exploratory study begins to address this lack by assessing perceptions of hiv risk among msm in rural limpopo province. using thematic analysis of interview and discussion data, two overarching global themes that encapsulated participants' understandings of hiv risk and the hiv risk environment in their communities were developed. in the first theme, community experience and the rural social environment, factors affecting hiv risk within the broad risk environment were discussed. these included perceptions of traditional value systems and communities as homophobic; jealousy and competition between msm; and the role of social media as a means of meeting other msm. the second global theme, hiv/aids knowledge, risk and experience, focused on factors more immediately affecting hiv transmission risk. these included: high levels of knowledge of heterosexual hiv risk, but limited knowledge of msm-specific risk; inconsistent condom and lubricant use; difficulties in negotiating condom and lubricant use due to uneven power dynamics in relationships; competition for sexual partners; multiple concurrent sexual partnerships; and transactional sex. these exploratory results suggest that rural south african msm, like their urban and peri-urban counterparts, are at high risk of contracting hiv, and that there is a need for more in-depth research into the interactions between the rural context and the specific hiv risk knowledge and behaviours that affect hiv risk in this population.
hiv_aids	the 2015 judgment of the namibia supreme court in government of the republic of namibia v lm and others set an important precedent on informed consent in a case involving the coercive sterilisation of hiv-positive women. this article analyses the reasoning and factual narratives of the judgment by applying neil manson and onora o'neill 's approach to informed consent as a communicative process. this is done in an effort to understand the practical import of the judgment in the particular context of resource constrained public healthcare facilities through which many women in southern africa access reproductive healthcare. while the judgment affirms certain established tenets in informed consent to surgical procedures, aspects of the reasoning in context demand more particularised applications of what it means for a patient to have capacity and to be informed, and to appropriately accommodate the disruptive role of power dynamics in the communicative process.
hiv_aids	individual factors associated with hiv testing have been studied across multiple populations; however, testing is not just an individual-level phenomenon. this secondary analysis of 2005 and 2011 ethiopia demographic and health survey data was conducted to determine the extent to which the 2007 institution of an opt-out policy of hiv testing during antenatal care increased testing among women, and whether effects differed by women 's stigmatizing beliefs about hiv. a logit model with interaction between pre-/post-policy year and policy exposure (birth in the past year) was used to estimate the increased probability of past-year testing, which may be attributable to the policy. results suggested the policy contributed to a nine-point increase in the probability of testing (95% ci 0.06-0.13, p < 0.0001). a three-way interaction was used to compare the effects of exposure to the policy among women holding higher and lower hiv stigmatizing beliefs. the increase in the probability of past-year testing was 16 percentage points greater among women with lower stigmatizing beliefs (95% ci 0.06-0.27, p = 0.002). women with higher stigmatizing beliefs were less likely to report attending antenatal care (anc), testing at their last anc visit, or being offered a test at their last anc visit. we encourage researchers and practitioners to explore interventions that operate at multiple levels of socio-ecological spheres of influence, addressing both stigma and structural barriers to testing, in order to achieve the greatest results in preventing hiv.
hiv_aids	we present three field experiments that probe the influence of choice architecture on the contributions of a total of 328 participants to real charities. in the first experiment, framing a one-time donation opportunity as an opt-out as opposed to opt-in decision significantly increases donations to an environmental non-profit. in the second experiment, an automatic donation mechanism is provided that allows subjects to self-select into an opt-out framing; when combined with incentive-neutral, social-norm supporting activities (cheap talk and voting), automatic donations sustain increased contributions over a ten-month study period to an hiv/aids-related charity. in the third experiment, we study the extent to which the mention of hiv/aids in the charity 's informational material impacts the emotions and donations of potential donors. in this case the connection to hiv/aids does not elicit stigma, but we do find that changes in mood from exposure to the charity 's informational material predict increased donations, and that donors experience an improved mood from donating.

hiv_aids	increased disclosure of hiv status has been shown to reduce disease transmission among persons living with hiv (plhiv). hiv-related stigma has been shown to reduce hiv disclosure; however, little is known about factors that may underlie the relation between hiv-related stigma and hiv disclosure. the current study examined emotion dysregulation (i.e., maladaptive generation, processing, and modulation of one 's emotions) in the relation between hiv-related stigma, sub-facets of hiv-related stigma, and hiv disclosure among plhiv seeking psychological treatment (n=80; 61.3% male; 56.3% african-american (non-hispanic); m-age=48.25, sd=7.39). results indicated past experiences of rejection due to one 's hiv status (i.e., enacted stigma), as well as subjective beliefs regarding how plhiv are evaluated by others (i.e., public attitudes stigma), are significantly related to hiv disclosure. additionally, these relations are moderated by emotion dysregulation. specifically, greater hiv-related stigma is associated with reduced hiv disclosure for individuals with greater emotion dysregulation. however, emotion dysregulation did not moderate the relations between negative self-image (e.g., shame, guilt) or disclosure concerns and hiv disclosure. findings suggest emotion dysregulation may play a moderating role for certain types of hiv disclosure.
hiv_aids	despite improved survival due to combination antiretroviral therapy (cart), youth with perinatallyacquired hiv (phiv) show cognitive deficits and developmental delay at increased rates. hiv affects the brain during critical periods of development, and the brain may be a persistent reservoir for hiv due to suboptimal blood brain barrier penetration of cart. we conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging (smri) and cognitive testing in 40 phiv youth (mean age = 16.7 years) recruited from the nih pediatric hiv/aids cohort study (phacs) who are part of the first generation of phiv youth surviving into adulthood. historical and current hiv disease severity and substance use measures were also collected. total and regional cortical grey matter brain volumes were compared to a group of 334 typically developing, hiv-unexposed and uninfected youth (frequency-matched for age and sex) from the pediatric imaging, neurocognition, and genetics (ping) study (mean age = 16.1 years). phiv youth had smaller (2.8-5.1%) total and regional grey matter volumes than hiv-unexposed and uninfected youth, with smallest volumes seen among phiv youth with higher past peak viral load (vl) and recent unsuppressed vl. in phiv youth, worse cognitive performance correlated with smaller volumes. this pattern of smaller grey matter volumes suggests that phiv infection may influence brain development and underlie cognitive dysfunction seen in this population. among phiv youth, smaller volumes were also linked to substance use (alcohol use: 9.0-13.4%; marijuana use: 10.1-16.0%). in this study, collection of substance use information was limited to the phiv cohort; future studies should also collect substance use information in controls to further address interactions between hiv and substance use on brain volume.

hiv_aids	the endogenous social support systems of young black men who have sex with men (ybmsm), like surrogate families and social networks, are considered crucial assets for hiv prevention in this population. yet, the extent to which these social systems foster sexual health protections or risks remains unclear. we examine the networked patterns of membership in ballroom houses and independent gay families, both black gay subcultures in the united states, and how these memberships are related to hiv protective and risk traits of members. drawing from a population-based sample of 618 ybmsm living in chicago between june 2013 and july 2014, we observe a suite of protective and risk traits and perform bivariate analyses to assess each of their associations with being a member of a house or family. we then present an analysis of the homophilous and heterophilous mixing on these traits that structures the patterns of house and family affiliations among members. the bivariate analyses show that members of the house and family communities were more likely than non-members to report protective traits like being aware of prep, having health coverage, having a primary care doctor, and discouraging sex drug use among peers. however, members were also more likely to engage in the use of sex drugs. with respect to how these traits inform specific house/family affiliations, results show that members who had a recent hiv test, who were prep aware, or who engaged in exchange sex were more likely to belong to the same house or family, while hiv positive individuals were less likely to cluster within houses or families. these findings provide insights regarding the strengths and vulnerabilities of the house and gay family communities that can inform more culturally specific interventions that build on the existing human and social capital in this milieu.

hiv_aids	hiv-related stigma is associated with many psychological challenges; however, minimal research has explored how perceived hiv-related stigma intersects with psychosocial issues that mothers living with hiv may experience including depression, perceived stress and social isolation. the present study aims to describe the correlates and predictors of hiv-related stigma in a cohort of women living with hiv (wlwh) from across ontario, canada during pregnancy and early postpartum. from march 2011 to december 2012, wlwh18 years (n=77) completed a study instrument measuring independent variables including sociodemographic characteristics, perceived stress, depression symptoms, social isolation, social support and perceived racism in the third trimester and 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum. multivariable linear regression was employed to explore the relationship between hiv-related stigma and multiple independent variables. hiv-related stigma generally increased from pregnancy to postpartum; however, there were no significant differences in hiv-related stigma across all study time points. in multivariable regression, depression symptoms and perceived racism were significant predictors of overall hiv-related stigma from pregnancy to postpartum. the present analysis contributes to our understanding of hiv-related stigma throughout the pregnancy-motherhood trajectory for wlwh including the interactional relationship between hiv-related stigma and other psychosocial variables, most notably, depression and racism.
migraine	introduction: according to the ihcd-3 beta classification, chronic migraine (cm) is headache occurring on 15 or more days/month. episodic migraine (em) can be divided into low frequency (lfem) and high frequency (hfem) depending on the headache days suffered per month. methods: we performed a clinical comparison of migraine characteristics according to monthly headache days suffered. patients were divided into three groups: lfem (1-9 headache days/month), hfem (10-14 headache days/month) and cm (>= 15 headache days/month). results: the analysis included 1109 patients. previously reported differences between em and cm were replicated. however, there were three times more clinical differences between lfem and hfem than between hfem and cm (15 vs. 6). a new model that takes 10 headache days as a cut-off value for cm would have a minimally higher predictive capacity (72.8%) and no statistical differences (71.8%) when comparing it to the current classification. conclusions: hfem patients have few clinical differences compared with cm patients. this includes the poor outcomes regarding headache-related disability and impact on daily life. according to these findings, neurologists and headache specialists should consider that the emotional and functional impact in hfem patients could be as disabling as in those with cm.
migraine	cerebral cavernous angioma or cavernoma is a benign vascular malformation, usually asymptomatic. it is infrequent and often its discovery is incidental, a so-called incidentaloma. however, these lesions can be symptomatic, causing headaches, epilepsy, cerebral hemorrhage and other neurological signs depending on the brain area involved. frontal localization is responsible for psychiatric disorders, particularly the prefrontal region, leading to prefrontal syndrome, a condition common in all frontal lobe tumors. psychopathological syndrome can be depression-type, pseudodepression syndrome or maniac-type, pseudomaniac syndrome. surgical treatment of lesions like this may not always be possible due to their location in eloquent areas. in this study, we describe an unusual association of migraine-like headache, epilepsy and frontal lobe pseudodepression late-onset syndrome in the same patient. we have considered this case interesting mainly for the rarity of both a headache with migraine features and for the late onset of pseudodepression syndrome. pathophysiology underlying migraine-like headache and that concerning the late-onset pseudodepression frontal lobe syndrome seems to be unclear. this case leads to further hypotheses about the mechanisms responsible for headache syndromes and psychopathological disorders, in the specific case when caused by a cerebral frontal lobe lesion.
migraine	new advances in understanding the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine (vm) have suggested a large overlap between migraine and vestibular pathways. we explored the regional distribution of gray (gm) and white matter (wm) abnormalities in vm patients in comparison to migraine patients with (mwa) and without aura (mwoa) and their correlations with patients' clinical manifestations. using a 3.0 tesla scanner, brain t2-weighted and 3d t1-weighted mri scans were acquired from 19 vm, 19 mwa, 19 mwoa and 20 age-matched controls. gm and wm volumetric abnormalities were estimated using voxel-based morphometry (spm12). compared to controls, migraine patients had decreased gm volume of the left cerebellum and an increased gm volume of the left temporal lobe. vm patients had a selective gm volume increase of frontal and occipital regions compared to controls and the other two groups of migraineurs and no regions with decreased gm volume. compared to mwoa and mwa, vm had increased gm volume of the left thalamus. regional gm abnormalities did not correlate with disease duration and attack frequency. no wm volumetric differences were detected between migraine patients and controls. these results show that gm volume abnormalities of nociceptive and multisensory vestibular brain areas occur in vm patients. overall, our findings suggest that an abnormal brain sensitization might lead to a dismodulation of multimodal sensory integration and processing cortical areas in vm patients.
migraine	objective: the safety and outcomes of intravenous thrombolysis (ivt) to stroke patients via telestroke (ts) is similar to those presenting to stroke centers. little is known on the accuracy of ts diagnosis among those receiving ivt. we sought to compare the rate of patients receiving ivt with diagnosis of ischemic stroke as opposed to stroke mimic (sm) in our ts network to those who presented to our comprehensive stroke center (csc). materials and methods: consecutive patients receiving ivt between august 2014 and june 2015 were identified at our csc and ts network. we compared rates of sm, post-ivt symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sich), in-hospital mortality, and discharge destination. results: we evaluated 131 receiving ivt were included in the analysis. rates of sm receiving ivt were similar (csc 12% versus 7% ts, p = 0.33). four stroke patients experienced sich or in-hospital mortality; neither were found among sm patients. discharge destination was similar between stroke and sm patients (p = 0.9). sm patients had higher diagnoses of migraine (p = 0.05) and psychiatric illness (p < 0.01). conclusion: the accuracy of diagnosing stroke in ivt-eligible patients evaluated via ts is similar to evaluations at our csc. continued efforts should be made to minimize exposure of sm patients to ivt in both settings.

migraine	background: epidemiological and clinical studies have demonstrated comorbidity between migraine and affective disorders. however, it is unclear whether chronic migraine can lead to affective disorders in other animals. methods: a classical chronic migraine rat model (repeated dura mater inflammatory soup [is] infusion) was used to evaluate depression and anxiety behaviour via weight, sucrose preference test, open field test and elevated plus maze test. results: we found that sucrose preference, locomotor and rearing behaviours, inner zoon distance percent, open-arm entries percent and serotonin and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex decreased significantly in the is group compared with those in the control group; co-administration of low-dose amitriptyline ameliorated these deficits. however, no differences in weight, inner zone time percent, or open-arm time percent between the is and control groups. these results were used to create new depression and anxiety scales to comprehensively assess and evaluate the degree of affective disorders in rats. most of chronic migraine animals showed depression and anxiety like behaviors but a few did n't. conclusions: most of the chronic migraine rats were present depression and anxiety like behaviors. the new scales we created are expected to use in the future studies to find out the potential mechanism of affective disorders' comorbidity.
migraine	aim of this work was to assess the role of polymorphisms belonging to genes involved in the regulation of ionic homeostasis in caucasian patients with meniere disease (md). we recruited 155 patients with definite meniere disease and 186 controls (control group 1) without a lifetime history of vertigo, overlapping with patients for age and rate of hypertension. we validated the positive results on 413 caucasian subjects selected from a european general population (control group 2). the clinical history for migraine and hypertension was collected; genomic dna was characterized for a panel of 33 snps encoding proteins involved in ionic transport. we found a higher rate of migraineurs in md subjects compared to group 1 (46.8 vs 15.5%, p = 0.00005). four snps displayed differences in md patients compared to group 1 controls: rs3746951 and rs2838301 in sik1 gene, rs434082 and rs487119 in slc8a1; the p values of chi-squared test for genotype frequencies are 0.009, 0.023, 0.009 and 0.048, respectively. slc8a1 gene encodes for na+-ca++ exchanger, while sik1 gene encodes for salt inducible kinase 1, an enzyme associated with na+-k+ atpase function. the validation with control group 2 displayed that only rs3746951 and rs487119 are strongly associated to md (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0004, respectively). these data support the hypothesis that a genetically induced dysfunction of ionic transport may act as a predisposing factors to develop md.
migraine	background: a 6-mg dose of sc sumatriptan is the most efficacious and fast-acting acute treatment for migraine, but a 3-mg dose of sc sumatriptan may improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy. methods: this randomized, double-blind, crossover study compared the efficacy and tolerability of 3 mg subcutaneous (sc) sumatriptan (dfn-11) with 6 mg sc sumatriptan in 20 adults with rapidly-escalating migraine attacks. eligible subjects were randomized (1:1) to treat 1 attack with dfn-11 and matching placebo autoinjector consecutively or 2 dfn-11 autoinjectors consecutively and a second attack similarly but with the alternative dose (3 mg or 6 mg). results: the proportions of subjects who were pain-free at 60 min postdose, the primary endpoint, were similar following treatment with 3 mg sc sumatriptan and 6 mg sc sumatriptan (50% vs 52.6%, p = .87). the proportions of subjects experiencing pain relief (p = .48); reductions in migraine pain intensity (p = .78); and relief from nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia (p = .88) with 3 mg sc sumatriptan and 6 mg sc sumatriptan were similar, as were the mean scores for satisfaction with treatment (m = 2.6 vs m = 2.4, p = .81) and the mean number of rescue medications used (m = .11 vs m = .26, p = .32). the most common adverse events with the 3- and 6-mg doses were triptan sensations - paresthesia, neck pain, flushing, and involuntary muscle contractions of the neck - and the incidence of adverse events with both doses was similar (32 events total: 3 mg, n = 14 [44%]; 6 mg, n = 18 [56%], p = .60). triptan sensations affected 4 subjects with the 6-mg dose only, 1 subject with the 3-mg dose only, and 7 subjects with both sumatriptan doses. chest pain affected 2 subjects (10%) treated with the 6-mg dose and no subjects (0%) treated with the 3-mg dose of dfn-11. there were no serious adverse events. conclusions: the 3-mg sc dose of sumatriptan in dfn-11 provided relief of migraine pain and associated symptoms comparable to a 6-mg sc dose of sumatriptan. tolerability was similar with both study medications; dfn-11 treatment was associated with fewer triptan sensations than the 6-mg dose. dfn-11, with its 3-mg dose of sumatriptan, may be a clinically useful alternative to higher-dose autoinjectors.
migraine	objective.-to describe the development of the impact of migraine on partners and adolescent children (impac) scale. background.-although existing data and clinical experience suggest that the impact of migraine is pervasive and extends beyond the individual with migraine, no validated tools exist for assessing the impact of migraine on the family. methods.-the chronic migraine epidemiology and outcomes (cameo) study is a longitudinal study of people with migraine in the united states. the family burden module (fbm) of the cameo study contained an item pool of 53 questions derived through literature review, clinician input, and patient focus groups pertaining to the following concepts: impact of migraine on family interpersonal relationships, activities, well-being, finances, and health-related quality of life. respondents with migraine (ie, probands) were categorized into 4 groups based on household composition: migraine probands with partners/spouses and children (m-pc), migraine probands with partners/spouses only (m-p), migraine probands with child(ren) only (m-c), and migraine probands without a partner/spouse or child(ren) (m-o). the impac scale was developed in 3 steps: (1) exploratory factor analysis and item reduction, (2) bifactor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and scoring, and (3) reliability and construct validity analyses. results.-the analysis of data from 13,064 respondents to the fbm meeting criteria for migraine yielded a 12-item impac scale, with 4 items applying to all of the groups, 4 more items applying to the groups with partners (m-p and m-pc), and 4 additional items to the groups with children (m-c and m-pc). item responses can be summed and converted into a scoring system assessing mild (<0.5 sd below mean; impac scale grade i), moderate (0.5 sd below to < 0.5 sd above mean; grade ii), severe (0.5-= 0.5 sd above mean; grade iv) family impact. test information curves relating to the impac scale for each household type indicated adequate reliability across a large range of family burden severity (from similar to 1 sd below to similar to 3 sd above mean) and impac scores showed moderate-to-large correlations with other validated tools (range, +/- 0.38-0.52), providing support for construct validity. conclusions.-we developed a questionnaire to assess family burden attributed to migraine that is brief, robust, and psychometrically sound, with a simple scoring algorithm that can be applied to various household compositions. this questionnaire may be valuable in research settings to provide quantifiable data on the impact of migraine on family dynamics and in clinical settings to facilitate conversations about family burden as a target and a motivation for better treatment.
migraine	objective: vertigo symptoms can lead to more or less vertigo-related handicap. this longitudinal study investigated whether depression, anxiety, and/or somatization mediate the relationship between vertigo symptoms and vertigo-related handicap. methods: n = 111 patients with vertigo/dizziness provided complete data on the following measures: vertigo symptoms at baseline, depression at 6-month follow-up, anxiety at 6-month follow-up, somatization at 6 month follow-up, and vertigo handicap at 12-month follow-up. mediation analyses with bootstrapping were performed to investigate the mediating role of anxiety, depression, and somatization in the relationship between vertigo symptoms and vertigo-related handicap. results: when the mediating role of anxiety, depression, and somatization was evaluated separately from each other in single mediation models, the effect vertigo symptoms at baseline exerted on vertigo-related handicap at 12-month follow-up was significantly mediated by depression at 6-month follow-up (p < 0.05), by anxiety at 6-month follow-up (p < 0.05), as well as by somatization at 6-month follow-up (p < 0.05). when statistically controlling for the other mediators in amultiple mediator model, only depression at 6-month follow-up mediated the effect of vertigo symptoms at baseline on vertigo-related handicap at 12-month follow-up (p <0.05). conclusion: psychological distress is an important mechanism in the process how vertigo symptoms lead to vertigo -related handicap.

migraine	primula veris l. is an important medicinal plant with documented use for the treatment of gout, headache and migraine reaching back to the middle ages. triterpenoid saponins from roots and flowers are used in up-to-date phytotherapeutic treatment of bronchitis and colds due to their expectorant and secretolytic effects. in addition to the wild type plants with yellow petals, a red variant and an intermediate orange form of primula veris l. have recently been found in a natural habitat. the secondary metabolite profiles of roots, leaves and flowers of these rare variants were investigated and compared with the wild type metabolome. two flavonoids, six flavonoid glycosides, four novel methylated flavonoid glycosides, five anthocyanins and three triterpenoid saponins were identified in alcoholic extracts from the petals, leaves and roots of the three variants by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc)-diode array detection (dad)/mass spectrometry (msn) analyses. anthocyanins were detected in the petals of the red and orange variety, but not in the wild type. no other effects on the metabolite profiles of the three varieties have been observed. the possibility is discussed that a regulatory step of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway may have been affected by mutation thus triggering color polymorphism in the petals.
osteoarthritis	this is a retrospective review of 80 intra-articular calcaneal fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation by a specialist team under supervision of a single surgeon in a tertiary centre between 2005 and 2014. the fractures were evaluated with plain radiography and computed tomography, and graded using the eastwood-atkins classification. a lateral approach was used and all fractures were fixed with calcaneal plates. all patients had clinical and radiological follow-up. clinical assessment included foot and ankle disability index, sf-36 (r) and kerratkins scores. the mean follow-up duration was 72 months (range: 12-130 months). the mean age of patients was 49 years (range: 17-73 years). there were three open fractures and eight patients had other injuries. the mean bohler 's angle improved from 6 degrees preoperatively to 26 degrees postoperatively. the mean foot and ankle disability index score was 78.62, the mean sf-36 r scores were 45.5 (physical component) and 52.6 (mental component), and the mean kerr-atkins score was 72 (range: 36-100). early complications included one case of screw protrusion in the subtalar joint (which warranted a repeat procedure), one sural nerve injury and one wound breakdown, which healed with non-operative measures. twelve patients had symptomatic subtalar joint osteoarthritis. four of these had subtalar fusion. we believe that our strict protocols of patient selection, intraoperative and postoperative management produced long-term results comparable with those in the peer reviewed literature.
osteoarthritis	recent advances in the development of new drugs to halt or even reverse the progression of osteoarthritis at an early-stage requires new tools to detect early degeneration of articular cartilage. we investigated the ability of an electromechanical probe and an automated indentation technique to characterize entire human articular surfaces for rapid non-destructive discrimination between early degenerated and healthy articular cartilage. human cadaveric asymptomatic articular surfaces (four pairs of distal femurs and four pairs of tibial plateaus) were used. they were assessed ex vivo: macroscopically, electromechanically, (maps of the electromechanical quantitative parameter, qp, reflecting streaming potentials), mechanically (maps of the instantaneous modulus, im), and through cartilage thickness. osteochondral cores were also harvested from healthy and degenerated regions for histological assessment, biochemical analyses, and unconfined compression tests. the macroscopic visual assessment delimited three distinct regions on each articular surface: region i was macroscopically degenerated, region ii was macroscopically normal but adjacent to regions i and iii was the remaining normal articular surface. thus, each extracted core was assigned to one of the three regions. a mixed effect model revealed that only the qp (p < 0.0001) and im (p < 0.0001) were able to statistically discriminate the three regions. effect size was higher for qp and im than other assessments, indicating greater sensitivity to distinguish early degeneration of cartilage. when considering the mapping feature of the qp and im techniques, it also revealed bilateral symmetry in a moderately similar distribution pattern between bilateral joints.

osteoarthritis	the efficacy of transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain and chronic non-cancer pain (chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neuropathic pain) is well established. several formulations of fentanyl transdermal systems have been developed to improve the drug delivery and prevent misuse of the active principle. the addition of a rate controlling membrane to the matrix system represented an important advance. the design and functional features of alghedon patch are compared with other approved generic fentanyl transdermal systems, emphasizing the distinctiveness of alghedon patch. alghedon patch has no liquid component in the finished product, therefore no leakage of active ingredient from the system can occur. a rate-controlling membrane provides controlled release of the active substance from the matrix reservoir, ensuring that fentanyl delivery and entry into the microcirculation is not solely controlled by the skin 's permeability to this active substance. alghedon patch contains part of the drug (approximately 15%) in the skin-contact adhesive: this innovative solution allows to overcome a typical drawback of transdermal patches, i.e. the long lag-time before the drug appears in plasma after the first administration, and provides rapid analgesia during the first hours of administration. alghedon fentanyl transdermal system employs materials commonly used in other transdermal applications and having established safety profiles. for each strength level, the fentanyl content - and, thus, the resulting residual fentanyl remaining in the patch after use - is at the lowest end of the range used in commercially available fentanyl patches, minimizing the potential for abuse and misuse.
osteoarthritis	osteoarthritis (oa) is a degenerative disease characterized by deterioration of articular cartilage. the aim of this study was to identify and characterize the expression of microrna-125b-5p (mir-125b-5p) in normal and oa synovial cells, and to determine its role in oa pathogenesis. first, the levels of mir-125b-5p and synoviolin 1 (syvn1) were detected among normal, mild oa and severe oa groups with the use of quantitative pcr. computational analysis was used to search for the target of the mir-125b-5p, and luciferase reporter assay system was used to validate syvn1 as the target gene of mir-125b-5p. then the syvn1 expression level of cells transfected with mir-125b-5p mimics or inhibitors was estimated using quantitative pcr and western blotting. finally, mtt assay was employed to estimate the effect of mir-125b-5p on apoptosis. we enrolled 36 participants consisting of 12 normal control, 12 mild oa and 12 severe oa, furthermore, we performed quantitative pcr to detect the levels of mir-125b-5p and syvn1 among those groups, and found that mir-125b-5p was expressed at highest level in severe oa compared with normal control and mild oa groups, while syvn1 was expressed at the lowest level in severe oa. additionally, we identified that syvn1 is a target of mir-125b-5p by using computational analysis and luciferase assay. transfection with mir-125b-5p mimic or inhibitor was employed to investigate the effect of mir-125b-5p on expression of syvn1 in synovial cells, and synovial cell viability and apoptosis, and the results showed that mir-125b-5p mimics significant decreased the expression of syvn1, a substantially promoted apoptosis of synovial cells, while mir-125b-5p inhibitors remarkably increased the level of syvn1, and substantially suppressed apoptosis of synovial cells. the data suggested that mir125b-5p promoted apoptosis of synovial cells through targeting syvn1 gene, with important implication for validating mir-125b-5p as a potential target for oa therapy.
osteoarthritis	purpose: the main objective of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the injection of plasma rich in platelet-derived growth factors (prgf) versus hyaluronic acid (ha) following arthroscopic surgery in patients diagnosed with internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (tmj) with osteoarthritis (oa). materials and methods: a total of 100 patients were randomised into two study groups. group a (n = 50) received an injection of prgf, and group b (n = 50) received an injection of ha. the mean age was 35.5 years (range 18-77 years), and 88% of the patients were women. the pain intensity (visual analogue scale) and the extent of maximum mouth opening before and after the procedure were statistically analysed. results: better results were observed in the group treated with prgf, with a significant reduction in pain at 18 months, compared with ha treatment. regarding mouth opening, an increase was observed in both groups, with no significant difference. conclusions: the injection of prgf following arthroscopy is more effective than the injection of ha with respect to pain in patients with advanced internal derangement of the tmj.

osteoarthritis	objective. this study aimed to quantify the cartilage- and subchondral bone-related effects of low-dose and high-dose meloxicam treatment in the late phase of mono-iodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis of the stifle. methods. thirty-four male wistar rats received intra-articular injection of mono iodoacetate to trigger osteoarthritis; 10 control animals (grp co) received saline. the mono-iodoacetate-injected rats were assigned to three groups and treated from week 4 to the end of week 7 with placebo (grp p, n = 11), low-dose (grpm lo, 10.2 mg/kg, n 112) or high-dose (grpm hi, 1 mg/kg, n = 11) meloxicam. after a period of 4 additional weeks (end of week 11) the animals were sacrificed, and the stifle joints were examined histologically and immunohistochemically for cyclooxygenase 2, in conformity with recommendations of the osteoarthritis research society international. serum cytokines il-6, tnf alpha and il-10 were measured at the end of weeks 3, 7, and 11. results. compared with saline-treated controls, animals treated with mono-iodoacetate developed various degrees of osteoarthritis. the cartilage degerieration score and the total cartilage degeneration width were significantly lower in both the low-dose (p = 0.012 and p = high -dose (p = 0.003 and p = 0.006) rneloxicam-treated groups than in the placebo group. in the subchondral bone, only high -dose rneloxicam exerted a significant protective effect (p 0.011). low-grade cox-2 expression observed in placebo-treated animals was abolished in both meloxicam groups. increase with borderline significance of tnf alpha in grpp from week 3 to week 7 (p = 0.049) and reduction of il-6 in grpm lo from week 3 to week 11 (p = 0.044) were observed. conclusion. in this rat model of osteoarthritis, both low -dose and high -dose meloxicam had la chondroprotective effect, and the high dose also protected against subchondral bone lesions. the results suggest a superior protection of the high -dose meloxicam arresting the low-grade inflammatory pathway accompanied by chronic cartilage deterioration.
osteoarthritis	background: pronated foot posture is associated with many clinical and biomechanical outcomes unique to medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (oa). though shoe-worn insole treatment, including lateral wedges, is commonly studied in this patient population, their effects on the specific subgroup of people with medial knee oa and concomitant pronated feet are unknown. the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lateral wedge insoles with custom arch support are more beneficial than lateral wedge insoles alone for knee and foot symptoms in people with medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis (oa) and pronated feet. methods: twenty-six people with pronated feet and symptomatic medial knee oa participated in a randomized crossover study comparing five degree lateral wedge foot insoles with and without custom foot arch support. each intervention was worn for two months, separated by a two-month washout period of no insoles wear. main outcomes included the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index (womac) pain and physical function subscales, the revised short-form foot function index (ffi-r) pain and stiffness subscales, and the timed stair climb test. regression modeling was conducted to examine treatment, period, and interaction effects. results: twenty-two participants completed the study, and no carryover or interaction effects were observed for any outcome. significant treatment effects were observed for the timed stair climb, with greater improvements seen with the lateral wedges with arch support. within-condition significant improvements were observed for womac pain and physical function, as well as ffi-r pain and stiffness with lateral wedges with arch support use. more adverse effects were reported with the lateral wedges alone, while more people preferred the lateral wedges with arch support overall. conclusions: addition of custom arch support to a standard lateral wedge insole may improve foot and knee symptoms in people with knee oa and concomitant pronated feet. these preliminary findings suggest further research evaluating the role of shoe-worn insoles for treatment of this specific sub-group of people with knee oa is warranted.
osteoarthritis	generalized estimating equations (gee) are useful tools for marginal regression analysis for longitudinal data. having a high number of variables along with the presence of missing data presents complex issues when working in a longitudinal context. in variable selection for instance, penalized generalized estimating equations have not been systematically developed to integrate missing data. the mi-pgee: multiple imputation penalized generalized estimating equations, an extension of the multiple imputation least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (mi-lasso) is presented. mi-pgee allows integration of missing data and within-subject correlation in variable selection procedures. missing data are dealt with using multiple imputation, and variable selection is performed using a group lasso penalty. estimated coefficients for the same variable across multiply imputed datasets are considered as a group while applying penalized generalized estimating equations, leading to a unique model across multiply-imputed datasets. in order to select the tuning parameter, a new bic-like criterion is proposed. in a simulation study, the advantage of using mi-pgee compared to simple imputation pgee is shown. the usefulness of the new method is illustrated by an application to a subgroup of the placebo arm of the strontium ranelate efficacy in knee osteoarthritis trial study.

osteoarthritis	objective: high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (hr-pqct)is a novel imaging modality capable of visualizing bone microarchitecture in vivo at human peripheral sites such as the distal radius and distal tibia. this research has extended the technology to provide a non-invasive assessment of bone microarchitecture at the human knee by establishing new hardware, imaging protocols and data analysis. design: a custom leg holder was developed to stabilize a human knee centrally within a second generation hrpqct field of view. five participants with anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions had their knee joint imaged in a continuous scan of 6 cm axially. the nominal isotropic voxel size was 60.7 mu m. bone mineral density and microarchitecture were assessed within the weight-bearing regions of medial and lateral compartments of the knee at three depths from the weight-bearing articular bone surface, including both the cortical and trabecular bone regions. results: scan duration was approximately 18 min per knee and produced 5 gb of projection data and 10 gb of reconstructed image data (2304 x 2304 image matrix, 1008 slices). motion during the scan was minimized by the leg holder and was similar in magnitude as a scan of the distal tibia. bone mineral density and microarchitectural parameters were assessed for 16 volumes of interest in the tibiofemoral joint. conclusions: this is a new non-invasive in vivo assessment tool for bone microarchitecture in the human knee that provides an opportunity to gain insight into normal, injured and surgically reconstructed human knee bone architecture in cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
osteoarthritis	pomegranate fruit extract (pe) rich in polyphenols has been shown to exert chondroprotective effects, but the mechanism is not established. here, we used an in vitro model of inflammation in osteoarthritis (oa) to investigate the potential of pe to suppress interleukin 1 beta (il-1)-stimulated expression of inflammatory cytokine il-6, generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) levels, and investigated the mechanism of nf-b inhibition by analyzing the activation of the kinases upstream of ib in primary human chondrocytes. total and phosphorylated forms of kinases and expression of il-6 were determined at protein and mrna levels by western immunoblotting and taqman assay, respectively. dihydrorhodamine 123 staining estimated ros generation. pomegranate fruit extract inhibited the mrna and protein expression of il-6, generation of ros, and inhibited the il-1-mediated phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-b kinase subunit beta (ikk), expression of ikk mrna, degradation of ib, and activation and nuclear translocation of nf-b/p65 in human chondrocytes. importantly, phosphorylation of nf-b-inducing kinase was blocked by pe in il-1-treated human oa chondrocytes. taken together, these data suggest that pe exerts the chondroprotective effect(s) by suppressing the production of il-6 and ros levels. inhibition of nf-b activation by pe was blocked via modulation of activation of upstream kinases in human oa chondrocytes. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
hereditary_angioedema	hereditary angioedema (hae) with deficiency of c1 inhibitor (c1-inh) is an autosomal-dominant disease characterized by recurrent episodes of potentially life-threatening angioedema. the objective is to study the incidence of hae among patients who visit the emergency department. this was a 3-year prospective observational screening study involving 13 urban tertiary emergency centers in osaka prefecture, japan. patients were included if they met the following criteria: unexplained edema of the body, upper airway obstruction accompanied by edema, anaphylaxis, acute abdomen with intestinal edema (including ileus and acute pancreatitis), or asthma attack. c1-inh activity and c4 level were measured at the time of emergency department admission during the period between july 2011 and june 2014. this study comprised 66 patients with a median age of 54.0 (iqr: 37.5-68.3) years. three patients were newly diagnosed as having hae, and 1 patient had already been diagnosed as having hae. c1-inh activity levels of the patients with hae were below the detection limit (<25%), whereas those of non-hae patients (n = 62) were 106% (iqr: 85.5%-127.0%) (normal range, 70%-130%). the median level of c4 was significantly lower in the patients with hae compared with those without hae (1.2 [iqr: 1-3] mg/dl vs 22 [iqr: 16.5-29.5] mg/dl, p<0.01) (normal range, 17-45mg/dl). three patients with undiagnosed hae were diagnosed as having hae in the emergency department during the 3-year period. if patients have signs and symptoms suspicious of hae, the levels of c1-inh activity and c4 should be measured.
hereditary_angioedema	due to marked heterogeneity of clinical presentations, comprehensive knowledge of angioedema phenotypes is crucial for correct diagnosis and choosing the appropriate therapeutic approach. one of the ways to a meaningful clinical distinction can be made between forms of angioedema occurring ""with or without wheals."" angioedema with wheals (rash) is a hallmark of urticaria, either acute or chronic, spontaneous or inducible. angioedema without wheals may still be manifested in about 10 % of patients with urticaria, but it may also occur as a separate entity. several classifications of angioedema as part of urticaria were published over time, while a latest one, released in 2014 (hawk group consensus, see below), provided a classification of all forms of ""angioedema without wheals"" distinct from urticaria, which will be the focus of the present review. at this time, the hawk consensus classification is the best in terms of covering the pathophysiology, mediators involved, angioedema triggers, and clinical expression. according to this classification, three types of hereditary angioedema (genetic c1-inh deficiency, normal c1-inh with factor xii mutations, and unknown origin) and four types of acquired angioedema (c1-inh deficiency, related to ace inhibitors intake, idiopathic histaminergic, and idiopathic non-histaminergic) are presented. we will review the distinctive clinical features of each phenotype in details.
hereditary_angioedema	background: hereditary angioedema with c1-inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae) is characterized by recurrent attacks of swelling that affect various body sites. such attacks are a frequent cause of visits to the emergency department and are often treated in the hospital. in recent years, self-administration of c1-inhibitor (c1-inh) concentrates at home has become an increasingly used option, with a positive impact on patient outcomes and quality of life. methods: this was an observational study of 6 months' duration in 56 patients with c1-inh-hae referred to a hae center in southern italy. the patients received three types of treatment for their swelling attacks: c1-inh concentrates administered at home (n = 25); icatibant administered at home (n = 12); and c1-inh concentrates administered in the hospital (n = 19). the objectives of this observational study were to compare therapy compliance (defined as the proportion of treated attacks) and quality of life in home-and hospital-treated patients, and to identify factors associated with the decision to use home therapy. results: overall, 918 attacks were reported over 6 months, of which 544 (59.2 %) were treated. total number of reported attacks and the mean (+/- sd) number of attacks per patient, respectively, in the three groups were: 611 and 24.4 (+/- 26.1) for home-based c1-inh; 191 and 15.9 (+/- 12.0) for home-based icatibant; 166 and 6.1 (+/- 6.5) for hospital-based c1-inh. differences in attack frequency between home-and hospital-based treatments were statistically significant (p = 0.002), while patient demographic characteristics and the disease severity score did not correlate with the use of home therapy. compliance with therapy was significantly better with home-based therapy (71.2 % of treated attacks with c1-inh and 44. 0 % with icatibant) than with hospital-based therapy (21.6 %, p = 0.003). quality of life showed an opposite trend, with patients on hospital-based treatment reporting the highest quality of life. conclusions: home-based therapy was associated with better compliance compared with hospital-based therapy. the choice to adopt home-based therapy appeared to correlate with a high attack frequency. home-based therapy is a valid treatment option for patients with c1-inh-hae and should be offered to all such patients, and especially to those with high attack frequency.
hereditary_angioedema	hereditary angioedema (hae) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations of the serping1 or the factor 12 genes. it is potentially fatal, particularly if not identified at an early stage. apart from androgens, which are contraindicated in children and in pregnant women, a range of effective, albeit very expensive treatments have recently become available for hae patients. the cost of these new treatments is beyond the reach of most developing countries. at this time, there is no cure for the disorder. in spite of mutations of the serping1 gene, autoimmunity and infections are not prominent features of the condition. here, we present the argument that hae should be viewed primarily as a metabolic liver disorder. this conceptual paradigm shift will stimulate basic research and may facilitate new therapeutic approaches to hae outlined in this paper. we suggest several novel potential treatment options for hae from the perspectives of clinical immunology, molecular biology, and liver transplantation. many of these offer the prospect of curing the disorder. the effectiveness of these options is rapidly improving in many cases, and their risks are decreasing. given the very high costs of treating hae, some of these curative options may become feasible in the next decade.
hereditary_angioedema	the aim of this study was to identify novel tnf-alpha blocking peptide(s) using phage display technology. two novel 7-mer tnf-alpha binding peptides p51 and p52 with kd values of 1.47 and 0.51 nm were identified. phage particles displaying p51 and p52 peptides at 0.318 nm concentration prevent cytotoxic effect of tnf-alpha on l929 cells by 8.2% and 16.15%, respectively. synthesized p51 and p52 peptides also inhibited tnf-alpha induced cytotoxicity with ic50 values of 25.15 +/- 2.18 and 7.08 +/- 2.24 mu m, respectively. the result of rt-pcr also supports the inhibitory activity of the identified peptides, where p51 and p52 significantly inhibit the inductive effect of tnf-alpha on i kappa b-alpha mrna levels. the inhibitory effects of the peptides were attributed to their abilities of binding at the intersubunit interfaces leading to tnf-alpha dissociation. the results of molecular docking studies revealed that the peptides- tnf-alpha complexes are mostly stabilized by hydrophobic contacts.

hereditary_angioedema	backgroundthe first classification of angioedema without wheals was recently reported and comprises different forms of the disease distinguished by aetiology, mediator of oedema and inheritance. methodsin total, 1725 consecutive patients with angioedema without wheals were examined at our centre between 1993 and 2012. we excluded from the analysis 667 patients because of incomplete data or because angioedema was related to a specific factor. resultsaccording to the new classification of angioedema, the 1058 patients included in this analysis were diagnosed with hereditary (hae; n=377) or acquired angioedema (aae; n=681). the former group included hae with c1-inhibitor (c1-inh) deficiency (c1-inh-hae; n=353) and hae with normal c1-inh levels (n=24), of which six had a factor xii mutation (fxii-hae) and 18 had disease of unknown origin (u-hae). the aae group included disease with c1-inh deficiency (c1-inh-aae; n=49), aae related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment (n=183), idiopathic histaminergic (ih-aae; n=379) and idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema (inh-aae; n=70). we compared hereditary and aae with uncertain aetiopathogenesis: the fxii-hae and u-hae groups pooled (fxii/u-hae) versus inh-aae. the median age at onset of fxii/u-hae and inh-aae was 26 and 38years, respectively. in addition, 56% of patients with fxii/u-hae and 81% of those with inh-aae reported more than five attacks per year (median duration of 48h). the location of angioedema in patients with fxii/u-hae versus those with inh-aae was the following: face, 70% versus 86%; tongue, oral cavity or larynx, 55% versus 68%; limbs, 70% versus 56%; and gastrointestinal mucosa, 50% versus 20%. prophylaxis with tranexamic acid was effective in all six patients with u-hae and in 37 of 38 with inh-aae who were started on this treatment. conclusionour findings in this cohort of patients with angioedema provide new information on the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
hereditary_angioedema	hereditary angioedema (hae) is a genetic condition that is characterized by frequent episodes of localized angioedema. it is a rare disorder that a primary care provider, otolaryngologist, dermatologist, or rheumatologist may encounter only occasionally. this disease is being reviewed because of the significant advances in further understanding the genetics, biology, and therapeutic management surrounding the condition. histamine-mediated angioedema responds to steroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine, whereas bradykinin-mediated angioedema is resistant to those interventions and requires specialized therapy. previously used medications have significant adverse effects. approved medications for hae have been effective in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with this condition. we review the presentation, diagnosis, and available pharmaceutical options for hae and explore the limitations of implementing recommended therapy.
hereditary_angioedema	introduction: measuring functional c1 inhibitor (c1 inh) with chromogenic or elisa methods can confirm a diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (hae) due to c1 inh deficiency. previous studies found differences in the agreement of these assays. objective: to evaluate the agreement between chromogenic or elisa methods in the context of an observational study. methods: patients with previously confirmed hae underwent functional c1 inh testing. these patients contacted first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, or offspring) not previously evaluated for hae, who underwent a panel of complement testing, including for functional c1 inh. results: overall, 31 patients with hae and 46 untested relatives enrolled. of 46 relatives, 14 (30.4%) were newly diagnosed with hae based on their laboratory results. among the 31 patients previously confirmed with hae, all had low functional c1 inh according to the chromogenic method, whereas 22 (71.0%) had low, 7 (22.6%) had equivocal, and 2 (6.5%) had normal functional c1 inh according to the elisa method. in the 14 newly diagnosed relatives, all had low functional c1 inh according to the chromogenic method, whereas 11 (78.5%) had low and 3 (21.4%) had equivocal results according to the elisa method. conclusion: despite the apparent discordance in the elisa and chromogenic assays in a small number of patients, both were useful in measuring functional c1 inh. to establish the diagnosis of hae due to c1 inh deficiency, functional c1 inh results should be interpreted in combination with family and clinical history, and with other complement tests.

hereditary_angioedema	abdominal pain is one of the basic clinical presentations of the hereditary angioedema and danazol is a common medicine which has been used for long years in patients with hereditary angioedema. we present two hereditary angioedema patients with abdominal pain albeit under danazol treatment, whose final diagnoses was colon carcinoma. there are two consequences in this article which shall be insisted on: first; in patients with hereditary angioedema, the differential diagnosis of ""abdominal pain"" is always important even though hereditary angioedema diagnosis exists. and the second; it can be hardy speculated that long term danazol treatment may cause different malignancies.
hereditary_angioedema	uncontrolled generation of bradykinin (bk) due to insufficient levels of protease inhibitors controlling contact phase (cp) activation, increased activity of cp proteins, and/or inadequate degradation of bk into inactive peptides increases vascular permeability via bk-receptor 2 (bkr2) and results in subcutaneous and submucosal edema formation. hereditary and acquired angioedema due to c1-inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae and -aae) are diseases characterized by serious and potentially fatal attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal edemas of upper airways, facial structures, abdomen, and extremities, due to inadequate control of bk generation. a decreased activity of c1-inhibitor is the hallmark of c1-inh-hae (types 1 and 2) due to a mutation in the c1-inhibitor gene, whereas the deficiency in c1-inhibitor in c1-inh-aae is the result of autoimmune phenomena. in hae with normal c1-inhibitor, a significant percentage of patients have an increased activity of factor xiia due to a fxii mutation (fxii-hae). treatment of c1-inhibitor-dependent angioedema focuses on restoring control of bk generation by inhibition of cp proteases by correcting the balance between cp inhibitors and bk breakdown or by inhibition of bk-mediated effects at the bkr2 on endothelial cells. this review will address the pathophysiology, clinical picture, diagnosis and available treatment in c1-inhibitor-dependent angioedema focusing on bk-release and its regulation.key messagesinadequate control of bradykinin formation results in the formation of characteristic subcutaneous and submucosal edemas of the skin, upper airways, facial structures, abdomen and extremities as seen in hereditary and acquired c1-inhibitor-dependent angioedema.diagnosis of hereditary and acquired c1-inhibitor-dependent angioedema may be troublesome as illustrated by the fact that there is a significant delay in diagnosis; a certain grade of suspicion is therefore crucial for quick diagnosis.submucosal edema formation in hereditary and acquired c1-inhibitor-dependent angioedema is potentially life threatening and can occur at any age.to date effective therapies for acute and prophylactic treatment are available.
kidney_health	an effective workforce is essential for delivery of high-quality chronic disease care. low-income nations are challenged by a dearth and/or maldistribution of an essential workforce required for all chronic disease care including chronic kidney disease (ckd). nephrology education and training in developed countries have grown at pace with the technological advancement in the practice of medicine in order to meet the standards required of kidney health professionals towards high-quality, patient-centered medical care. the standards designed by institutions and/or professional societies, such as royal colleges and medical councils in high-income nations with well-developed health systems and infrastructures, are often not easily translatable to issues critical to nephrology practice in low-income nations. little or no guidance is provided on common nephrological issues of regional nature or pertaining to ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups living in those countries. there is an emergent need for a training curriculum that meets the needs and peculiarities of the developing nations, and this needs to leverage on the existing and well-validated systems of training across the globe. we evaluated nephrology training programs across 25 upper-middle and high-income nations to identify best practices and opportunities for adoption in low-income nations. we reviewed training guidelines from major professional societies on content and process of training. there are similarities and differences in structure, content, and process of training programs across countries, and there are clearly adoptable concepts/frameworks for application in low-income nations. we provide recommendations and a strategic plan for the future focus of nephrology training in the developing world to align with current trends in technological advancement and development as well as the need for emphasis on prevention of ckd. the essential competencies (patient- and population-based) required of a nephrologist in a developing world setting are outlined with practical measures and an action plan for adoption.
kidney_health	the veterans affairs (va) is the largest integrated health care system in the united states and is responsible for the care of a population with a disproportionately high rate of ckd. as such, ensuring access to kidney health services is a va imperative. one facet of the va 's strategy to reduce ckd is to leverage the use of teletechnology to expand the va 's outreach to veterans with kidney disease. a wide array of teletechnology services have been deployed to both pull in veterans and push out kidney health services to veterans in their preferred health care venue. teletechnology, thus, expands veteran choice, facilitates their access to care, and furthers the goal of delivering patient-centered kidney specialty care. the va has demonstrated the feasibility of virtual delivery of kidney specialty care services and education via synchronous and asynchronous approaches. the challenges ahead include determining the relative health care value of kidney telehealth services, identifying veterans most likely to benefit from specific technologies and optimizing the adoption of effective kidney telehealth services by both providers and patients alike to ensure optimal and timely kidney health care delivery.
kidney_health	chronic kidney disease (ckd), defined as an egfr < 60ml/min/l 73m(2), affects up to 25% of the united states population in addition, it is estimated that approximately 6% of the population have early evidence of ckd and will likely progress to end stage renal disease (esrd) in the near future further, esrd is more common in many ethnic minorities, with african-americans having the highest rates of treated esrd, closely followed by hispanic americans, when compared to non- hispanic white persons although african-americans with ckd are more likely to die than non-hispanic white persons with ckd, these trends reverse once progression to esrd is established the reasons for the disparities in the prevalence and incidence of ckd, esrd, and mortality are unclear, but likely involve a complex interaction of socioeconomic, environmental and genetic factors this review highlights current data pertaining to the social and economic impact of ethnic differences in the prevalence and incidence of ckd and esrd in the united stated it is hoped that highlighting the current trend of kidney related health disparities will not only lead to an improved understanding of these issues, but also more informed research agendas, that are ultimately aimed at alleviating ethnic differences in kidney health outcomes
kidney_health	the kidneys play a critical role in the homeostasis of body fluid tonicity and effective circulating volume. renal homeostatic mechanisms are frequently challenged in acutely ill people. fluid depletion causing hypovolemia may result in renal hypo-perfusion that, if left untreated, may lead to acute kidney failure. some populations, notably older people and neonates, are less tolerant of extremes in fluid loading and deprivation, similar to those with established chronic kidney disease. risk of kidney injury during fluid depletion is increased by medications including diuretics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and renin-angiotensin system blockers. there is no consistent evidence indicating that lower-than-average fluid intake can cause chronic kidney disease, nor accelerate progression of established kidney disease. increasing consumption of sugar-containing beverages is, however, a major concern for kidney health as a precursor of obesity and diabetes. there is no evidence that high dietary protein intake can cause chronic kidney disease, nor accelerate progression of established kidney disease. idiosyncratic, adverse renal responses have been described with creatine supplements. there are only a few clinical conditions for which high fluid intake should be considered. these include recurrent kidney stones or urinary tract infections and, possibly, polycystic kidney disease.
kidney_health	the purpose of the study was to examine the health of children born to cosmetologists compared to the health of children of women working in other occupations. cross-sectional data were analyzed from 319 cosmetologists and 366 women in other occupations aged 21 to 55 years who reported at least one live birth. repeated-measures modeling was used to account for lack of independence among multiple pregnancies per participant. the results showed that cosmetologist occupation was associated with having a child with a learning disorder; however, the strength of this association was attenuated and the odds ratio was not statistically significant after confounder adjustment. cosmetologist occupation was not associated with other adverse health outcomes among the children born to women in such an occupation, including urinary/kidney health problems. the findings indicate that cosmetologists are not at increased risk of having a child with medical problems compared to women in other occupations.

kidney_health	the temporal urinary proteome was examined in 4 groups of individuals in order to determine the temporal stability of diverse individuals with apparently good kidney health. the groups consisted of (1) healthy volunteers at zero time, 1 and 6 months, (2) kidney donors before and after surgery, (3) recipients immediately after surgery, and (4) successful kidney transplant recipients from 1 month to 4 years after transplant. proteins were detected by reverse phase extraction of urine followed by maldi-tof profile and by itraq analysis. unusual components of the maldi-tof profiles found only in transplant subjects occurred at m/z = 3370, 3441 and 3385 (human neutrophil defensins), 4303, 10350, and 11732 (beta-2 microglobulin, b2m). the peaks at m/z = 4303 and 11732 were also quite intense among kidney donors following surgery. the peaks at m/z = 4303 and 10350 in transplant recipients were associated with higher serum creatinine. several additional proteins detected by itraq were up-regulated in a manner that correlated closely with b2m. overall, despite large differences between protein composition in different transplant recipients, there was remarkable stability for each individual as detected by either maldi-tof or itraq analyses. these results suggested that, within limits, stability of profile components may be as important as protein content for definition of kidney health. longitudinal study of urinary proteins from kidney recipients may demonstrate instability as a sensitive biomarker of adverse kidney health.
kidney_health	diet is one of the largest modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease (ckd)-related death and disability. ckd is largely a progressive disease; however, it is increasingly appreciated that hallmarks of chronic kidney disease such as albuminuria can regress over time. the factors driving albuminuria resolution remain elusive. since albuminuria is a strong risk factor for gfr loss, modifiable lifestyle factors that lead to an improvement in albuminuria would likely reduce the burden of ckd in high-risk individuals, such as patients with diabetes. dietary therapy such as protein and sodium restriction has historically been used in the management of ckd. evidence is emerging to indicate that other nutrients may influence kidney health, either through metabolic or haemodynamic pathways or via the modification of gut homeostasis. this review focuses on the role of diet in the pathogenesis and progression of ckd and discusses the latest findings related to the mechanisms of diet-induced kidney disease. it is possible that optimizing diet quality or restricting dietary intake could be harnessed as an adjunct therapy for ckd prevention or progression in susceptible individuals, thereby reducing the burden of ckd.
kidney_health	background: physical activity (pa) may play a role in preserving kidney health. the purpose of this study was to determine if pa and sedentary behavior are associated with incident chronic kidney disease (ckd) and change in kidney function in older adults. methods: the health, aging, and body composition study is a prospective cohort of 3075 well-functioning older adults. pa and television watching was measured by self-report, and serum cystatin c was used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (egfr). ckd was defined as an egfr3ml/min/1.73m(2). discrete survival analysis was used to determine if baseline pa and television watching were related to 10-year cumulative incidence of ckd and rapid decline in kidney function. results: individuals who reported watching television >3 hours/day had a higher risk of incident ckd (hr 1.34; 95% ci, 1.09-1.65) and experiencing a rapid decline in kidney function (hr 1.26; 95% ci, 1.05-1.52) compared with individuals who watched television <2 hours/day. pa was not related to either outcome. conclusions: high levels of television watching are associated with declining kidney function; the mechanisms that underlie this association need further study.
kidney_health	background: indigenous canadians have high rates of risk factors for chronic kidney disease (ckd), in particular diabetes. furthermore, they have increased rates of complications associated with ckd, such as kidney failure and vascular disease. our objective was to describe the prevalence of ckd in this population. study design: cross-sectional cohort. setting & participants: indigenous (first nations) canadians 18 years or older screened as part of the first nations community based screening to improve kidney health and prevent dialysis (finished) project, an initiative completed in 2015 that accomplished community-wide screening in 11 rural communities in manitoba, canada. predictors: indigenous ethnicity and geographic location (communities accessible by road compared with those accessible only by air). outcome: prevalence of ckd, presumed based on a single ascertainment of urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uacr) >= 30 mg/g and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr)= 30 mg/g or egfr, 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). communities accessible by road had a lower prevalence of ckd (17.6%) than more remote communities accessible only by air (34.4%). of those screened, 3.3% had reduced kidney function (defined as egfr, 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). severely increased albuminuria was present in 5.0% of those screened. limitations: presumption of chronicity based on a single ascertainment. there is a possibility of sampling bias, the net direction of which is uncertain. conclusions: we found a 2-fold higher prevalence of ckd in indigenous canadians in comparison to the general population and a prevalence of severely increased albuminuria that was 5-fold higher. this is comparable to patients with diabetes and/or hypertension. public health strategies to screen, triage, and treat all canadian indigenous peoples with ckd should be considered.

kidney_health	background: chronic kidney disease (ckd) and end-stage-kidney disease (eskd) continue to be under-diagnosed and a major burden for aboriginal communities in central australia. the aim of this study was to examine the risk of poor clinical outcomes associated with elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (acr) among aboriginal people in central australia. methods: cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of end stage kidney disease (eskd), dialysis, cvd (cardiovascular disease) and mortality associated with participants' baseline albuminuria reading from a 10-year cohort study of aboriginal people (n = 623) from three communities in central australia. predictors of progression of albuminuria were also examined in the context of the kidney health australia (kha) risk matrix. results: a baseline acr level of >= 3.5 mg/mmol was associated with an almost 10-fold increased risk of eskd (95% ci 2.07-43.8) and a 15-fold risk of dialysis (95% ci 1.89-121). albuminuria >= 3.5 mg/mmol was also associated with a borderline 63 % increased risk of cvd (95% ci 0.98-2.71). no significant association was observed with mortality from all-causes or chronic disease. diabetes and a waist-to-hip ratio >= 0.90 independently predicted a two-fold increased risk of a progression to higher acr levels. conclusions: a single measure of moderately increased albuminuria was a strong predictor of renal failure in this population. a single spot urine acr analysis in conjunction with the kha risk matrix may be a useful and efficient strategy to screen for risk of ckd and progression to dialysis in remote communities. a focus on individuals with diabetes and/or central obesity for strategies to avoid increases in albuminuria may also prevent future ckd and cvd complications.
autism	the ability to read mental states from subtle facial cues is an important part of theory of mind, which can contribute to children 's daily life social functioning. mental state reading performance is influenced by the specific interactions in which it is applied; familiarity with characteristics of these interactions (such as the person) can enhance performance. the aim of this research is to gain insight in this context effect for mental state reading in children, assessed with the reading the mind in the eyes (rme) task that originally consists of pictures of adults' eyes. because of differences between children and adults in roles, development and frequency of interaction, children are more familiar with mental state reading of other children. it can therefore be expected that children 's mental state reading depends on whether this is assessed with children 's or adults' eyes. a new 14 item version of the rme for children was constructed with pictures of children instead of adults (study 1). this task was used and compared to the original child rme in 6-10 year olds (n = 718, study 2) and 8-14 year olds (n = 182, study 3). children in both groups performed better on the new rme than on the original rme. item level findings of the new rme were in line with previous findings on the task and test re-test reliability (in a subgroup of older children, n = 95) was adequate (0.47). this suggests that the rme with children 's eyes can assess children 's daily life mental state reading and supplement existing tom tasks.
autism	background: progress in diagnostic assessment made it possible to diagnose asd at a young age. concurrently, intervention research for toddlers with asd has increased since the past decade. method: in this study, we report on a five-level meta-analysis of 34 single-subject experimental studies, intended to offer a better insight into what types of interventions are effective for toddlers under the age of three with or at risk for asd. results: the analysis revealed a significant positive overall effect size. we found that interventions at home were significantly more effective compared to those in other settings. other significant moderators regarding intervention characteristics were the agent of intervention and duration in weeks. no moderator effects of study and child characteristics were found. conclusions: on average, interventions for toddlers with or at risk for asd are successful.

autism	epidemiological studies have implicated fine particulate matter (pm2.5) as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. however, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the influences of different components remain largely elusive. here, we extended our previous work to investigate the role of oxidative stress and dna hydroxymethylation in neuronal pathology of pm2.5. we found pm2.5 and its extracts (water-soluble extracts, organic extracts and carbon core component) differentially caused cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis and the cell proliferation inhibition in neuronal cells. these effects were mechanistically related to each other and oxidative stress, suggesting pm2.5 and toxic compounds adsorbed on the particles may cause different types of brain damages. in addition, pm2.5 and its organic extracts increased global dna hydroxymethylation and gene specific dna hydroxymethylation of neuronal genes, and subsequently interfered with their mrna expression. the impairments in neuronal progression characterized with decreased length of neurite and reduced mrna expression of neuronal markers and synaptic markers. the blocking effects of antioxidants demonstrated the involvement of oxidative stress-mediated hydroxymethylation abnormalities in pm2.5-induced defects in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. our results first revealed the role of oxidative stress-mediated abnormal dna hydroxymethylation in neuronal impairments of pm2.5, and thoroughly evaluated the neurocytotoxicity of different components.

autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental condition characterized by variable impairments in communication and social interaction as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. heterogeneity of presentation is a hallmark. investigations of immune system problems in asd, including aberrations in cytokine profiles and signaling, have been increasing in recent times and are the subject of ongoing interest. with the aim of establishing whether cytokines have utility as potential biomarkers that may define a subgroup of asd, or function as an objective measure of response to treatment, this review summarizes the role of the immune system, discusses the relationship between the immune system, the brain, and behavior, and presents previously-identified immune system abnormalities in asd, specifically addressing the role of cytokines in these aberrations. the roles and identification of biomarkers are also addressed, particularly with respect to cytokine profiles in asd.
autism	background: our previous studies demonstrated that post-weaning social isolation (iso) in mice induces behavior abnormalities such as deficits of sociability-and attention-like behaviors. these deficits can be attenuated by methylphenidate (mph), a drug used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), suggesting that iso mice offer a potential animal model of comorbid developmental disorder with adhd and autism spectrum disorder symptoms. this study investigated the effects of kampo formulae, yokukansan (yks) and keishito (kst), on the neuropsychiatric symptoms of iso mice to clarify the therapeutic or preventive/delaying potential of these formulae for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. methods: three-to-4-week old male icr mice were socially isolated during an experimental period and yks and kst (1523.6 and 2031.8 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered starting from week 2 and week 0 after starting iso for the analysis of their therapeutic and preventive/delaying potentials, respectively. sociability, attention-related behavior and fear memory were elucidated by a 3 chamber test, a water-finding test and fear conditioning test, respectively. moreover, the phosphorylation of neuroplasticity-related signaling molecules in mice hippocampus was analyzed using western blotting. results: in a therapeutic procedure, yks ameliorated iso-induced impairments of attention-like behavior and context-dependent fear memory, but not of sociability, whereas kst had no beneficial effects in iso mice. in experiments to analyze the preventive/delaying potentials of these treatments, both yks and kst improved sociability, attention, and context-dependent fear memory deficits. the improvement of sociability in mice by yks and kst was not inhibited by a dopamine d-1 receptor antagonist, suggesting that yks and kst improved the iso-induced sociability deficit by other mechanisms besides activation of the dopaminergic system. on the other hand, the beneficial effects of yks and kst on attention-like behavior were inhibited by a muscarinic antagonist, suggesting that yks and kst ameliorated iso-induced attention-like behavior through a cholinergic mechanism. moreover, the phosphorylated forms of camkii and creb were down-regulated by iso stress and restored by yks and kst administration. conclusions: these findings suggest that yks and kst may be useful for the improvement of neurodevelopmental disorders.
autism	in some cases, parents caring for an adult child with an intellectual and/or developmental disability (idd) must balance this with caregiving for another family member. this dual responsibility, referred to as ""compound caregiving"", may contribute to increased feelings of distress, or change their perceived ability to care for their child. the current study examined how compound caregivers differ from other parents of adults with idd, and whether compound caregiving is significantly associated with family distress. data was available for 199 parents aged 38 to 91 years who were seeking adult services for their son or daughter with idd. parents completed a mailed questionnaire and telephone interview in which they indicated compound caregiver responsibilities. parents identified as compound caregivers were then compared to those who were not in terms of family characteristics, as well as parental perceptions of burden and mastery, and family distress as measured by the revised caregiver appraisal scale and the brief family distress scale, respectively. nearly half of the parents reported being compound caregivers. the demographic profile of these parents was no different from that of the other parents but their children were slightly younger. compound caregiving was significantly associated with parental perceptions of burden and mastery and family distress. demands outside of caring for an adult child with idd can negatively influence family functioning and must be included as part of caregiving assessments.
autism	parents' expectations are known to be a central component in children 's development through multiple pathways; however, limited information exists regarding expectations of parents of children with developmental disabilities. the purpose of the current study was to examine future expectations of parents of children with cerebral palsy (cp), as well as the differences in expectations between mothers and fathers. forty-nine mothers and fathers of children with cp (6-12 years) participated in this study. parents completed a parental future expectations questionnaire for children with disabilities, and a perception of child 's ability questionnaire, as well as the pediatric evaluation disability inventory (pedi). the gross motor function measure-66 (gmfm-66) was completed by physical therapists. parental differences in future expectations were analyzed and multiple-stepwise regressions established parental expectations' predictors. parents' expectations correlated with their child 's characteristics. parents of children with lower levels of functioning reported lower expectations. no differences were found between mothers' and fathers' future expectations; however, differences were found between expectations' predictors. predictors of mothers' expectations were their perceptions of their child 's abilities as well as child 's performance. fathers' predictors were child 's level of functional impairment and their perceptions of their child 's abilities. the results indicate that parental expectations relate to their child 's functional ability and differ between parents in relation to the child 's level of impairment (fathers) or child 's actual performance (mothers). these differences should be acknowledged by clinicians when they provide specific support for children with chronic physical disabilities and their families.
autism	dysfunction of brain-derived arginine-vasopressin (avp) systems may be involved in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (asd). certain regions such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus are known to contain either avp neurons or terminals and may play an important role in regulating complex social behaviors. the present study was designed to investigate the concomitant changes in autistic behaviors, circulating avp levels, and the structure and functional connectivity (fc) of specific brain regions in autistic children compared with typically developing children (tdc) aged from 3 to 5 years. the results showed: (1) children with asd had a significantly increased volume in the left amygdala and left hippocampus, and a significantly decreased volume in the bilateral hypothalamus compared to tdc, and these were positively correlated with plasma avp level. (2) autistic children had a negative fc between the left amygdala and the bilateral supramarginal gyri compared to tdc. the degree of the negative fc between amygdala and supramarginal gyrus was associated with a higher score on the clinical autism behavior checklist. (3) the degree of negative fc between left amygdala and left supramarginal gyrus was associated with a lowering of the circulating avp concentration in boys with asd. (4) autistic children showed a higher fc between left hippocampus and right subcortical area compared to tdc. (5) the circulating avp was negatively correlated with the visual and listening response score of the childhood autism rating scale. these results strongly suggest that changes in structure and fc in brain regions containing avp may be involved in the etiology of autism.
autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd) is characterized by impairment in social communication and restricted and repetitive interests. while not included in the diagnostic characterization, aspects of face processing and learning have shown disruptions at all stages of development in asd, although the exact nature and extent of the impairment vary by age and level of functioning of the asd sample as well as by task demands. in this review, we examine the nature of face attention, perception, and learning in individuals with asd focusing on three broad age ranges (early development, middle childhood, and adolescence/adulthood). we propose that early delays in basic face processing contribute to the atypical trajectory of social communicative skills in individuals with asd and contribute to poor social learning throughout development. face learning is a life-long necessity, as the social world of individual only broadens with age, and thus addressing both the source of the impairment in asd as well as the trajectory of ability throughout the lifespan, through targeted treatments, may serve to positively impact the lives of individuals who struggle with social information and understanding.
autism	background and purpose a thick corpus callosum (tcc) can be associated with a very grave outcome in fetuses, but its clinical presentation in older children seems to be markedly different. methods the corpus callosum (cc) was defined as thick based on observations and impressions. we reviewed cases of children who were diagnosed as tcc based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) studies. the pertinent clinical data of these children were collected, and their ccs were measured. results out of 2,552 brain mri images, those of 37 children were initially considered as showing a tcc. those initial imaging were reviewed by an experienced neuroradiologist, who confirmed the diagnosis in 34 children (1.3%): 13 had neurofibromatosis-1 (nf-1), 9 had epilepsy, 3 had macrocephaly capillary malformation (mcm) syndrome, 3 had autistic spectrum disorder, 1 had a chiari-1 malformation, and 1 had increased head circumference. no specific neurologic disorder could be defined in seven children. the measured thickness of the cc in these children was comparable to those published in the literature for adults. conclusions a tcc is a rare brain malformation that can be found in neuropathologies with apparently diverse pathognomonic mechanisms, such as nf-1 and mcm. it is not necessarily associated with life-threatening conditions, instead being a relatively benign finding, different in nature from that reported in fetuses.
